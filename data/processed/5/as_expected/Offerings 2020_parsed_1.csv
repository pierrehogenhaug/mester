Each investor should consult with his or her own advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of a purchase of the Notes. In this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, all references to “€”, “EUR” or “Euro” are to the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of the European economic and monetary union, and as defined in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of May 3, 1998 on the introduction of the Euro, as amended. Furthermore, all references to “ILS” or “Israeli new shekel” are to the currency of Israel. Where financial information in tables in this Offering Memorandum is labelled “audited”, this means that it has been taken from the audited financial statements incorporated by reference into this Offering Memorandum. The label “unaudited” is used in tables in this Offering Memorandum to indicate financial information that has not been taken from the audited financial statements incorporated by reference into this Offering Memorandum, but was taken from the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, internal reporting system, or is based on calculations of figures from the abovementioned sources. All of the financial data presented in the Offering Memorandum are shown in thousands of Euro (in € thousands or “€ thousand”), except as otherwise stated. Certain financial information (including percentages) in this Offering Memorandum is rounded according to established commercial standards. As a result, the aggregate amounts (sum totals or sub-totals or differences or if numbers are put in relation) in tables in this Offering Memorandum may not correspond in all cases to the aggregated amounts of the underlying (unrounded) figures appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, in those tables, these rounded figures may not add up exactly to the totals contained in those tables. Financial information presented in parentheses denotes the negative of such number presented. In respect of financial information set out in this Offering Memorandum, a dash (“–”) signifies that the relevant figure is not available, while a zero (“0.0”) signifies that the relevant figure is available but has been rounded to zero. References to “CET” in this Offering Memorandum refer to Central European Time or Central European Summertime, as the case may be. References to time in this Offering Memorandum refer to CET, unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, this Offering Memorandum contains industry related data taken or derived from industry and market research reports published by third parties (“External Data”). Commercial publications generally state that the information they contain originated from sources assumed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and that the calculations contained therein are based on a series of assumptions. The External Data have not been independently verified by the Issuer. The External Data was reproduced accurately by the Issuer in the Offering Memorandum, and as far as the Issuer is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by any third party, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced External Data inaccurate or misleading. The Issuer does not have access to the underlying facts and assumptions of numerical and market data and other information contained in publicly available sources. Consequently, such numerical and market data or other information cannot be verified by the Issuer.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to the ADLER Group’s Business Activities and Industry,13.1.1,Our business is significantly dependent on our ability to generate rental income. Our rental income and funds from operations could particularly be negatively affected by a potential increase in vacancy rates.,"We rely significantly on rental income. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, 84.7% of our revenue was derived from rental activities (including facility services), and our funds from operations (from rental activities) (“FFO 1”) amounted to €44,311 thousand (compared to 89.5% and €33,430 thousand in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, respectively). Our rental income is impacted predominantly by the size of our portfolio, which consisted of 74,682 units (excluding parking spaces and other units) (with a total lettable area of 4,709,519 sqm) of which 72,380 were residential units (with a total lettable area of 4,440,581 sqm), as well as rent levels, which amounted to €6.20 per sqm on average (excluding parking spaces and other units) (all figures as of June 30, 2020). As a result, our performance depends largely on the amount of rental income generated, which in turn is significantly dependent on the vacancy levels of our portfolio. As of June 30, 2020, the average vacancy level of our residential portfolio (in % per sqm) was at 5.5% (or 243,859 sqm) and of our commercial portfolio at 7.8% (or 20,919 sqm), after 2.9% (or 42,771 sqm) and 4.8% (or 8,210 sqm), respectively, as of June 30, 2019. The vacancy levels within our portfolio could increase, particularly in lower-value residential units, in less attractive locations, in areas with weak infrastructure or in properties where investments do not result in increased rents in line with expected market rents or increased occupancy levels. Our strategy also focuses on the renovation and refurbishment of selected parts of our portfolio with the highest vacancy levels. If these measures do not result in a significant reduction in vacancy levels for these properties after completion of the renovation and refurbishment work, this could have an adverse effect on our financial results relative to our business plan. In addition to lost rental income, additional fixed and ancillary costs incurred for the maintenance of vacant residential units could reduce our operating profit. Furthermore, a longer period of high vacancy levels could generally lead to lower levels of income from rental activities and make it more difficult to increase average rental levels. As our income from rental activities (including facility services) represents 84.7% of the revenue generated in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 (compared to 89.5% in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019), our ability to reduce vacancy levels or increase rents will significantly contribute to future growth of our revenue. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to the ADLER Group’s Business Activities and Industry,13.1.2,"Our ability to operate our business successfully relies on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and circumstances that may be unfavorable, in part or as a whole, in particular due to unexpected liabilities, an incomplete or inaccurate assessment of a market, value determinations and due diligence findings and challenges with respect to achieving anticipated synergies and insufficient investment horizons.","We face the risk that we may not be able to generate returns or generate significantly lower returns in the future. In particular, our projections of the future demand for apartments suitable for modernization may turn out to be inaccurate or inappropriate to achieve a positive return. Also, tenant preferences may change. Further, we may not be in a position to find sufficient investment opportunities to achieve further growth. In addition, we may not be able to pass on the costs for these modernization measures to our tenants due to legal constraints or if the tenants would be unable to afford rent increases as a result of these modernization measures. Tenants may also cause postponements to our modernization measures by, for example, refusing to vacate the units for modernization work to take place. Further, we may be restricted in our ability to finance the investment program through loans or other debt instruments depending on our current and future debt level and structure. The success of our business model depends in part on our ability to increase rent levels through modernizing our existing real estate portfolio and real estate properties that we acquire as well as our ability to estimate and control the costs of such modernizations. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we incurred maintenance and capital expenditures of €11.5 per sqm (compared to €18.4 per sqm in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019), whereas our average like-for-like rental growth of the residential portfolio during the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2020 amounted to 1.9%. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, maintenance and capital expenditures amounted to €36.2 per sqm (compared to €39.2 per sqm in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018) and average like-for-like rental growth of the residential portfolio amounted to 5% for the same period. We plan to continue investing a significant amount into modernization measures, particularly in residential markets that provide for significant rent upside for refurbished apartments. Due to the current Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel), this is not the case for our property portfolio located in Berlin. There is no assurance that the targeted rent upside can be realized. Even if the existing real estate portfolio and the real estate properties that we may acquire can be repositioned, modernized and refurbished, such measures could prove to be unsuccessful or ineffective and not result in targeted rent levels. Further, our assumptions in relation to achievable rental levels, rental increases, vacancy rates, modernization costs, personnel (including in-house facility management personnel), overhead expenses, maintenance and capital expenditures may prove to be partially or entirely inaccurate. Furthermore, unforeseen issues or risks could materialize that could result in substantially increased maintenance and capital expenditures, in particular, due to changes in applicable laws and regulations; or we may be unable to resolve such issues or risks at all or not in an economically reasonable manner. Regarding environmental matters relevant to modernizations and refurbishments, see “—Regulatory _and Legal Risks—Our business is subject to the general legal environment in Germany. Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel regulation, may be detrimental to us.” and “We may incur environmental liabilities, for example, from residual pollution including wartime ordinance, soil conditions, asbestos and contaminants in building materials, as well as from possible building code violations.”._ In the event that a building is subject to historic preservation laws, compliance with the respective historic preservation requirements could significantly delay the refurbishment or modernization process and could result in significantly higher expenses for the particular project. Consequently, we may be unable to perform our obligations to a tenant, which could result in rent to be deferred or not due at all. In addition, legal requirements relating to our properties could become more stringent or onerous, particularly with respect to construction and environmental requirements; similarly, requirements might be imposed to increase the availability of handicapped-accessible and adapted housing. The realization of any of these risks could have a negative effect on our ability to successfully conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

We may not be able to identify all risks associated with any such acquisitions. Assumptions could prove to be insufficient or incorrect and a successful integration of acquisitions may not be achievable.,"As part of our strategy, we evaluate real estate portfolios in order to identify those that might complement our existing portfolio and our current management platform. Between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020, we have acquired 4,650 residential real estate units with a total residential area of 322 thousand sqm. In addition, through the completion of the takeover offer for ADLER Real Estate Aktiengesellschaft (“ADLER Real Estate” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “ADLER Real Estate Group”), we acquired an additional 58,007 residential real estate units with a total residential area of 3,494,017 sqm. The units we have acquired or will acquire may generate less than the originally calculated rental income or operating profit due to inaccurate projections and assumptions or for other reasons. Although we have attempted and will continue to attempt to address the relevant issues, including for example tax, legal and operational management issues, arising from acquisitions, we may not have addressed and in the future may not address all relevant issues related thereto and to the successful integration of the acquired portfolios. In particular, the integration risks associated with acquisitions of large portfolios are high due to their significant size. The integration of any future portfolio acquisitions may not be successful or may be more difficult than expected due to legal and contractual restrictions and obligations. In addition, we may be unable to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale and cost-savings. We may become subject to contractual obligations under acquisition agreements pursuant to which we acquired our real estate portfolio, which limit our ability to fully integrate acquisitions on a legal and operational basis that may result in delays and unforeseen costs. Moreover, laws governing pensions, labor unions and works councils may also limit our ability to integrate acquisitions and especially to move employees from one legal entity to another. To the extent that we are not able to successfully integrate our current portfolio and any potential future portfolio acquisitions, we may be prevented from increasing revenues or reducing costs by achieving economies of scale in the manner that we anticipate. Any such failure could cause reduced levels of rental income and operating profit. Furthermore, investments in properties involve considerable risks. We are not always able to obtain from the seller the records and documents that we need in order to fully verify that the buildings we acquire were constructed in accordance, and that their use complies, with applicable planning laws and building code regulations. We may only be able to conduct limited due diligence on, or the due diligence conducted may not accurately reveal the risks associated with, the properties or entities we plan to acquire. Accordingly, we may not be in a position to examine whether the original owners of the properties, and/or the properties themselves, have obtained all required permits for new buildings, satisfied all permit conditions, received all necessary licenses and fire, health and safety certificates, or satisfied all comparable requirements. In addition, the properties may suffer from hidden defects, such as contamination, and may thus require significant modernization investments. For example, while performing due diligence, we may not have discovered, or the seller may not have disclosed, that the properties that we have acquired have underground oil tanks underneath them or contain certain types of fungus which may weaken the structural foundations of our acquired properties. In addition, we may not have been able or may be unable to undertake (or obtain results for) all searches (including title and collateral searches), inspections and surveys (including intrusive environmental and asbestos investigations and technical surveys) that we might otherwise carry out in relation to comparable acquisitions. Accordingly, in the course of the acquisition of residential and other property portfolios, specific risks may not be, or might not have been, recognized or evaluated correctly. Thus, legal and/or economic liabilities may be, or might have been, overlooked or misjudged. These circumstances could lead to additional costs and could have an adverse effect on our proceeds from sales and rental income of the relevant properties. The assumptions we rely on when acquiring real estate, particularly with respect to anticipated rents, achievability of vacancy reduction, maintenance expenses, integration costs and expected proceeds from condominium sales, could turn out to be incorrect. Although sellers typically make various warranties in purchase agreements that we enter into in connection with property acquisitions, it is possible that these warranties do not cover all risks or that they fail to cover such risks sufficiently. Additionally, a warranty made by a seller may be unenforceable due to the seller’s insolvency or for other reasons. In some cases, a real estate seller makes no representation or warranty as to the sufficiency and correctness of the information that is made available in the context of a due diligence investigation, or as to whether such information remains correct during the period between the conclusion of the due diligence and the closing of the relevant acquisition. Accordingly, such risks can arise despite a thorough due diligence. ----- It could also subsequently become more difficult to let or sell certain properties; market rents could develop unfavorably; and/or vacancy rates could increase. In addition, the various factors that affect market rents make it difficult to project future rental income, so that the rental income in relation to an acquired property can develop differently than projected. Our current portfolios, or portfolios that may be acquired in the future, may not develop as expected. For example, targeted rent increases may not be implemented as planned due to a lack of tenants who are willing or able to pay increased rents, a negative development of the location or property or increased vacancy rates, for example due to unfavorable demographic or economic developments. Any inability on our part to identify and assess all risks in connection with acquisitions as well as insufficient or inaccurate assumptions could hinder or render impossible a successful integration of acquisitions, as a result of which we may incur higher costs, lower rental income or divergent value developments, which in turn could lead to material adverse effects on our business, net assets, financial position and results of operations as well as our prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Fluctuation in the development of the currently high demand and prices could make it difficult for us to conduct our business activities and to implement our strategy to capture additional growth opportunities.","As of June 30, 2020, our real estate portfolio comprised 74,682 units (excluding parking spaces and other units) units, of which 72,380 were residential units, with a portfolio value of €8.9 billion. Prior to the completion of the takeover offer for ADLER Real Estate, all of the real estate that ADLER Group S.A. (formerly ADO Properties S.A.) directly and indirectly owned was located in Berlin, and Berlin continues to represent a significant part of our portfolio. Accordingly, we are extensively dependent on trends in the Berlin residential real estate market, as well as general economic conditions and developments in Berlin. Our performance and the valuation of our properties are dependent on various factors including demographic and cyclicality trends in Berlin, purchasing power of the population, the development of the population, attractiveness of the particular locations of our properties, the unemployment rate and employment offers, infrastructure, social structure, and supply and demand for real estate space and assets in the respective locations and markets in Berlin. As of June 30, 2020, 25.6% of the total number of residential units owned by the ADLER Group are located in Berlin. This could create a disadvantage compared to competitors who have a more geographically diversified real estate portfolio. In particular, the demand for residential real estate is subject to rapid and occasionally unpredictable changes, including as a result of changes to economic conditions, interest rates and business confidence. The effects of any decline in the attractiveness of the Berlin real estate market and of any downturn or illiquidity in the Berlin real estate market could significantly harm our business. In addition, regional economic and political developments, and other trends in the Berlin market, have a significant impact on the demand for our residential real estate and the rents achievable, as well as on the valuation of our properties. Such local developments may differ considerably from overall developments in Germany. For example, the purchasing power of residents of eastern German states lagged behind the purchasing power of the residents of western German states in 2018 and 2019 (source: GfK—Purchasing Power Germany). While some cities and regions in eastern Germany have seen decreasing unemployment rates and growing purchasing power in recent years, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue. Furthermore, we are also affected by the German economic conditions as a whole, such as growth in gross domestic product (“GDP”), unemployment, interest rates, inflation and financing availability.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Our ability to sell properties generally depends on the liquidity of the real estate markets at the time of the potential sale. The demand for real estate assets is influenced by, among other factors, the quality of the property, vacancy rates, the overall economic and market situation at the time of the sale, the level of interest rates and the availability of debt financing to market participants. As a result, if we were required to sell parts of our portfolio, particularly on short notice or under legal, financial or time pressure, there is no guarantee that we would be able to do so in a timely fashion or on favorable terms ----- or at all. In the event of a forced sale, for example, if creditors realize collateral, there would likely be a significant shortfall between the fair value of the property or property portfolio in question or the shares in the real estate company, as the case may be, and the price achievable upon the sale of such property or property portfolio or shares in such circumstances, and there can be no guarantee that the price obtained by us would represent a fair or market value for the property or property portfolio or shares.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to the ADLER Group’s Business Activities and Industry,13.1.6,Existing rent restrictions in connection with the promotion of public authorities and with heat supply contracts could limit the rent levels we may be able to charge.,"Some of the properties that we have acquired are currently or have been subsidized by public authorities, mainly in the form of loans. As a result of such subsidies, certain restrictions are imposed, inter alia, on the maximum rent levels for the properties constructed, acquired or modernized using such subsidies and the eligibility of prospective tenants of publicly subsidized residential space. Such rent levels are significantly below current market rents for a number of rent restricted residential units, and it may be difficult to increase rents to market levels even after the lapse of the period in which subsidy restrictions apply. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our properties were rent-restricted due to subsidies. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, rental income from such residential units amounted to €6.0 million (or 3.6% of our total rental income), compared to €2.8 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (or 2.5% of the total rental income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding the units sold under the Gewobag Sale (as defined below)). As of June 30, 2020, approximately 29% (by units) of the rent restrictions as a result of subsidies are scheduled to expire by 2022. The subsidies are subject to certain conditions. If we become unable to meet those conditions or violate them, we may have to pay a fine (e.g. in the case of not meeting rent restrictions) or subsidies may even be subject to revocation. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions relating to heat supply contracting (Nahwärme and Fernwärme). The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) has ruled that unless otherwise stipulated in the letting contract, a landlord is not allowed to introduce heat supply contracting without the tenant’s consent. One of the consequences of this ruling is that in some local rent sub-indices in Berlin, the margin by which we can increase the rent for residential units that we let with heat supply contracting has narrowed. Such limitation could ultimately restrict our ability to increase rents for the affected residential units and, ultimately, the profitability of our business activities and our ability to generate rental income in line with our strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

The completion (the “Completion”) of the combination of the business of ADLER Real Estate AG and its consolidated subsidiaries with the business of ADO Properties S.A. (renamed to ADLER Group S.A.) and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Business Combination”) following the voluntary takeover offer by the Company for all shares in ADLER Real Estate in the form of an exchange offer, as published on February 7, 2020, (the “ADLER Offer”) allowed the Company to consolidate the ADLER Real Estate Group’s property portfolio in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The geographic distribution of our residential property portfolio as of June 30, 2020 was as follows: Berlin: 19,098 units (49% of GAV), Lower-Saxony: 17,958 (16% of GAV), North Rhine Westphalia: 13,700 units (13% of GAV), Saxony: 9,561 units (9% of GAV) with the remainder located in various other federal states. In addition, we follow an opportunistic approach regarding acquisitions and focus on real estate property that we believe has potential for value increase. Consequently, we continuously seek investment opportunities throughout our key markets and the region of our strategic focus. Additionally, we monitor other markets that we believe may meet our investment criteria. Therefore, acquisition opportunities might arise in markets outside of our key markets. Therefore, the geographical composition of our property portfolio may change further, either as a result of new acquisitions or as a result of divestitures of properties by us, in particular should we shift our strategic focus to new markets. A change in the geographical composition of the property portfolio may lead to increased concentration in certain geographical areas, or introduce or increase dependencies on regional market conditions in new or different geographical areas. These may have different fundamentals, trends or legal, regulatory and tax regimes than the current region where our real estate properties are located. A broader geographical distribution may also result in additional costs in connection with the management of the properties ----- and reduce the benefits of economies of scale.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to the ADLER Group’s Business Activities and Industry,13.1.8,Our business could be adversely impacted by negative developments in the economy and in the residential real estate markets in Germany.,"We are active in the residential real estate market and have focused our activities on various residential real estate markets in Germany. As of June 30, 2020, the value of our real estate portfolio was €8.9 billion. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we derived 84.7% of our revenue from rental activities (including facility services). The success of our business therefore significantly depends on the development of the residential real estate market in Germany. The average German disposable income per capita increased from €21,611 in 2016 to €22,899 in 2018 (source: _Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung der Länder) and unemployment decreased from 4.1% to 3.4% over the_ same period (source: Federal Statistical Office—Press Release 075), while our weighted average monthly rent for residential properties decreased from €6.42 (per sqm) in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, to €6.20 (per sqm) in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Real estate markets, however, are generally susceptible to changes in the overall economy. Consequently, our business is affected by factors affecting the general economic environment, such as interest rates, levels of public debt, GDP, inflation rates and political and financial market conditions, primarily in Germany and our various submarkets. These factors play an important role in determining property values, rent levels, re-letting periods, overall demand, vacancy rates and turnover rates in these markets and submarkets. In addition, local and regional variations of these factors may cause their impact to vary significantly across our residential real estate portfolio. In particular, unemployment in Berlin at 6.1% was above the national average (source: Eurostat—Unemployment). Additionally, the estimated purchasing power per capita was at €21,689 in Berlin in 2019 and therefore below the national average of €23,779 (source: GfK—Purchasing Power Germany). Our business is therefore highly dependent on macroeconomic and political developments, including changes in legislation, as well as other general trends affecting Germany. As an export-driven economy, Germany is particularly affected by the development of the world economy in general and the Eurozone in particular. While unemployment rates in Germany were relatively low in recent years, with 3.3% (as adjusted) in Germany as of December 2018 (source: Federal Statistical Office— _Unemployment), public debt and unemployment levels remain high in many countries in the Eurozone, such as_ Italy, Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal, and future economic growth in the Eurozone is threatened by the fragile state of economic recovery in many Eurozone countries. The European and global economies may be impacted by many factors, inter alia, Brexit (as defined below) (see “The withdrawal of the United Kingdom _from the European Union may continue to cause significant political and economic uncertainty in the European Union and in the United Kingdom.”), current geopolitical crises such as in Syria and the Ukraine, the uncertain_ economic prospects in China and other parts of the world, the results of recent and future elections in a number of Eurozone countries (including Germany) and other factors, such as the fluctuation of raw material prices and currency fluctuations. Furthermore, increased trade barriers resulting from the imposition of tariffs could negatively impact the global and regional economies. For example, in June 2018, the U.S. introduced new trade tariffs on certain steel and aluminum products (in addition to imposing punitive tariffs on trade partners such as China, Canada or Mexico). In response, the European Union (the “EU”) introduced retaliatory tariffs on a list of American signature products. Any further escalation of trade disputes could lead to a worsening economic environment or outlook. In addition, strengthening populist movements in a number of EU member states create a risk of further destabilization of the EU and increased economic uncertainty. Such uncertainty and the resulting market volatility may create contagion risks for economically strong countries such as Germany and may spread to the Eurozone or other financial sectors and residential real estate markets. In addition, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the “Coronavirus”), first identified in December 2019, has resulted in a deterioration of the political, socio-economic and financial situation in Germany, and consequently this could have a negative impact on our business. Any widespread health crisis, including the Coronavirus and future pandemics, could result in our tenants being unable to pay their rents when due or at all, adversely affect the fair value of our real estate properties, cause a significant decline of aggregate rent levels in affected areas and, ultimately, affect our ability to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all. ----- Adverse economic developments and other negative trends in the commercial and residential real estate markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Since January 1, 2017 and as of June 30, 2020, we have acquired 4,650 residential real estate units with a total residential lettable area of 322 thousand sqm, of which 89 were residential units for privatization with a total property size of approximately 4,000 sqm across three properties. Moreover, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have successfully completed the Business Combination with ADLER Real Estate, whose rental properties are mainly located in the German federal states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg. Further acquisitions are only feasible, however, if attractive real estate portfolios and properties are available for purchase at reasonable prices. Given the current high demand for residential real estate in Germany, and, in particular, in Berlin, such portfolios and properties may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms. Any such development could impair the growth of our business and could prevent us from generating additional economies of scale and strategically developing our portfolio and properties for privatization through acquisitions and investing into our portfolios with attractive returns. Our general ability to sell parts of our real estate portfolio depends on the state of investment markets and on market liquidity or declining real estate values. If we were required to sell parts of our real estate portfolio for the purpose of raising cash to support our operations, to repay debt or for other reasons, there is no guarantee that we would be able to sell such parts of our portfolio on favorable terms or at all. In addition, existing contractual obligations under loan or purchase agreements restrict our ability to sell certain parts of our portfolio. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our residential units were subject to rent restrictions that stem from public subsidies. In the case of a forced sale of all or part of our real estate portfolio, for example if creditors realize collateral, there would likely be a significant shortfall between the price obtained and the carrying amount of the portfolio sold. In addition, a number of factors beyond our control, such as the overall development of real estate markets, construction activity, zoning and planning laws, influence the availability of offices, hotels, logistics/wholesale, retail, and residential properties generally. There is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to identify or acquire a sufficient number of suitable properties at reasonable prices that will allow us to successfully implement our business strategy or grow our business effectively. The supply of real estate properties and portfolios available for sale may also be reduced due to fewer sales by private or public sellers. If for instance state-owned entities reduce or cease privatizing or selling their real estate holdings, as they have done over the past years, then supply, in particular for residential real estate, could be reduced, which may result in increased competition for acquisitions of suitable properties and may motivate potential sellers to sell properties through an auction process. The use of auction processes for the sale of properties has become increasingly common and may increase in the future. Any of these factors may result in increased prices for the types of properties which are our strategic focus. As a result, it could be more difficult for us to successfully acquire properties, which could limit our ability to grow our businesses effectively. We are exposed to competition from national and international investors in the markets in which we operate. We compete to acquire attractive properties with other investors, such as international real estate funds, German open-ended and closed-ended funds and publicly listed German real estate companies, any of which may have greater resources, better information or better access to properties or financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. We also compete with other property companies, investment funds, institutional investors, building contractors, individual owners and other entities to attract and retain suitable tenants on favorable terms. Competition in the real estate markets we target is generally intense and could further intensify in the future. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully compete in any of the regions within our strategic focus or will be able to enter new regions successfully. Changes in law or regulation may also create environments in which we can no longer effectively compete. In the future, increased competition could also require us to change our business strategy in part or in whole and could affect our ability to generate sufficient income.

While low interest rates have generally not led to the desired levels of inflation, they have benefitted the Eurozone economies and supported demand for real estate, including commercial and residential real estate, due to the resulting availability of inexpensive financing. The benign interest rate environment has also had a positive impact on real estate valuations, as it tends to result in an increase of the value of future cash flows. Should overall economic growth accelerate, however, the European Central Bank could become more vigilant with regard to inflationary pressures and begin a cycle of monetary tightening, including through progressive increases in base interest rates, particularly if this growth leads to a ----- tightening of the labor market. This could lead to a rise in interest rates in Germany and throughout the Eurozone and could result in increased investor interest in investments with a higher risk profile and a decrease in the attractiveness of real estate investments, resulting in lower demand for real estate and broad declines in real estate valuations, among other effects. An increase in interest rates could adversely impact our business in a number of ways, including the willingness of potential purchasers to acquire real estate in an environment of rising interest rates may be negatively affected, thereby restricting our ability to dispose of our properties on favorable terms when desired. Most purchasers finance their acquisitions with lender provided financing through mortgages and comparable security (in Germany so called land-charges).

Furthermore, sellers often restrict the buyer’s right to terminate existing leases, which reduces the attractiveness of the affected units for prospective purchasers. The aforementioned restrictions are especially common in connection with the privatization of publicly-owned properties, where the selling public authorities often intend to mitigate potential social effects of such transactions, or when these portfolios are subsequently sold on to third parties. Usually, most obligations lapse in full or in part after a certain period of time. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our residential units, with a total of 184,338 sqm of residential area, which accounted for 3.9% of the rental income generated over the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, were subject to certain contractual restrictions, including multiple restrictions or obligations. These limitations include in particular: - restrictions on sales; - preferential subscription rights; - restrictions on the termination of lease agreements; - restrictions on permitted use; and - restrictions on rent increases. In addition to these contractual obligations entered into in connection with acquisitions, we have acquired properties that have received subsidies from public authorities which restrict the level of rents chargeable on a part of our portfolio.

We employ and work together with a large number of service providers, including energy providers, providers of minor repairs and maintenance services and construction companies and therefore are dependent on their performance. In connection therewith, we incurred costs of approximately €74.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Such services may not be rendered in a timely manner or their quality may not ----- comply with our requirements, regulatory framework or stipulations included in the service contracts. Moreover, certain contractors may experience operational or financial issues and certain services may become unavailable to us as a result thereof. Any failures by contractors to deliver in accordance with their contractual obligations may result in delays and additional expenses for us. Since 2007, we have operated a fully integrated platform whereby we use our own personnel for key functions from portfolio management to modernization and privatization. In 2013, we added facility management to our platform. For these purposes, we have our own business areas of asset and portfolio management, property and facility management, and construction management. We employed approximately 1,120 employees (full-time equivalent) (“FTE”) as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, of which approximately 10 FTE, 1,030 FTE and 80 FTE were assigned to the areas of asset and portfolio management, property and facility management, and construction management, respectively. As further acquisitions take place, we may increase the number of personnel in the future. In addition, we have entered into agreements with third parties for providing additional asset management and further services in order to benefit from their expertise and support in the respective areas. Our ability to manage our operations and growth requires the continuous improvement of operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. If, as a result of business or economic conditions, we were forced to scale down our business operations, it would be substantially more difficult and costly for us to reduce our headcount than to reduce the services provided by third-party contractors. Despite the existing quality control procedures, the quality of services rendered by our own employees could fall below the level of services performed by third-party contractors and reduce the attractiveness of our properties. Since some of these tasks are performed internally, we may not be in a position to claim compensation for damages from third parties for non-performance or improper performance. Moreover, if services rendered by our employees are not performed as scheduled or in a timely manner, or if the quality of work or the delayed execution of our work falls below applicable standards, we may face claims from our tenants, including rent reductions and additional compensations, or may not be in a position to re-let vacant units that require maintenance and modernization before new tenants can move in. In addition, in the course of rendering services, our employees, third-party suppliers, tenants or other individuals may be injured which, ultimately, exposes us to liability risks in relation thereto. If the services from third-party providers are not performed in accordance with their contractual obligations or services, including those rendered by personnel of our integrated platform for portfolio management and privatization, are not performed as scheduled or if the quality of work falls below applicable standards, we may face claims from our tenants or from purchasers of individual residential units and may be exposed to delays and additional expenses, and ultimately not be in a position to re-let vacant units that require maintenance and modernization before new tenants or purchasers can move in.

The commercial portion of our portfolio accounted for 8.0% of our rental income as of June 30, 2020 (compared to approximately 7.6% of our rental income as of December 31, 2019). Our commercial units compete with other commercial properties in the neighborhood, demand for such units is siteand location-specific, which may result in narrower demand relative to residential units and may lead to prolonged or permanent vacancies. In terms of rent, the risk is more concentrated as lease contracts are usually made for higher amounts than for residential units. In addition, the re-letting of a commercial unit generally takes longer than the re-letting of a residential unit. Also, in the event of an economic crisis the demand for commercial units is adversely affected quicker than the demand for residential units.

Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel regulation, may be detrimental to us.”). Typically, the costs_ associated with maintaining a rental property at market standards are borne primarily by the property owner. As maintenance, repair and modernization are required to comply with changing legal or market requirements (e.g. with regard to energy saving), we may be burdened with substantial additional expenses. In Germany, rent increases to compensate for these expenses may only be introduced under certain conditions and rent increases for all modernization projects announced as from January 1, 2019 must not exceed 8% of the total costs incurred in connection with the modernization measures and are capped at €3.0 per square meter within six years, or if the rent is less than €7.0 per square meter the rent may only increase by €2.0 per sqm within six years. In addition, we may not be able to increase rents to the extent legally permissible as a result of prevailing market conditions or the inability of tenants receiving social welfare (Arbeitslosengeld II, Hartz IV) and housing subsidies (Wohngeld), as is the case for a part of our tenants, to afford these increased rents or otherwise. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, our maintenance and capital expenditures – on average – amounted to €11.5 per sqm to our overall portfolios, amounting to total costs of approximately €55.8 million in that period. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2019 these expenditures averaged €23.3 per sqm. In comparison, our average maintenance and capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to €36.2 per sqm (corresponding to total costs of approximately €58.7 million during that period), which was a decrease compared to average maintenance and capital expenditures of €39.2 per sqm incurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Although we constantly review the condition of our properties and have established a reporting system to monitor and budget the necessary maintenance, repair and modernization measures, numerous factors may generate substantial cost overruns or unexpected increases in costs for maintenance, repairs and modernization. These factors, which may include the material and substances used at the time of construction, currently unknown building code violations, the age of the relevant building and/or any inability to process damage reports in a timely manner, could result in substantial unbudgeted costs for refurbishment, repairs, modernization, damages arising from the delayed execution or non-execution of repairs and/or maintenance measures, decontamination required to remove and dispose of any hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos) which are harmful to the health of the residents, or other maintenance or upgrade work. 66.7% of our residential units were built between 1950 and 2013 and 32.9% were built prior to 1950 (calculated on the basis of the fair value of our residential units as of June 30, 2020). We would incur additional and unexpected costs if the actual costs of maintaining or modernizing our properties were to exceed currently recognized cost levels, if we are not permitted to raise rents in connection with maintenance and modernization due to statutory or contractual constraints, or if hidden defects that are not covered by insurance or contractual warranties are discovered during the maintenance or modernization processes. Moreover, due to the current Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel), we have significantly decreased our maintenance and capital expenditure in relation to our property portfolio located in Berlin, which could, in the future, weaken the structural condition of our residential properties at that location. Any failure to undertake appropriate maintenance and modernization work at all or on economically reasonable terms in response to the factors described above could adversely affect the rental income earned from affected properties.

Our rental income depends on, _inter alia, our ability to let our properties at profitable rent levels. Such efforts are influenced by a number of factors, including the remaining term of existing lease agreements, the commercial ----- conditions of current tenants and the attractiveness of residential real estate units for new or existing tenants. We may be unable to renew expiring lease agreements on acceptable terms or to find suitable tenants willing to enter into new lease agreements. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to successfully compete for suitable tenants with other landlords, who may be able to offer more attractive properties, lease terms and/or rent levels. If we misjudge the current or future attractiveness of our properties, it may be difficult to find suitable tenants that are willing to rent our properties at the rent levels or for the time periods anticipated by us. To a lesser extent, the same applies to our ability to let our commercial real estate properties which, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, generated 8.0% of our rental income (compared to 7.6% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019). Failure to find and retain suitable tenants may prevent us from maintaining our current vacancy rate or letting vacant space, or may force us to reduce the rent levels to demands from current and future tenants. In addition, the financial capacity or creditworthiness of our tenants may deteriorate over time, reducing their ability to make payments under their leases on time or at all. Reductions in tenants’ abilities to make payments under their leases may force us to reduce rent levels for the relevant properties, resulting in rental income that is significantly lower than originally estimated, while our operating and financing costs might remain largely fixed or even increase. We may also be forced to engage in expensive and time-consuming administrative or legal proceedings in order to evict certain defaulting tenants. Further, insolvency or other restructuring activities undertaken by our tenants, with or without our consent, may result in modifications to the terms of our leases. Although we do not consider any single rental agreement to be material to our position, we take steps to verify the financial capacity of our tenants prior to entering into leases with them and, as such steps may not always be adequate or may not reveal undisclosed problems with such tenant’s financial capacity. Ultimately, however, we may enter into a significant number of rental agreements on the basis of inadequate verification processes that could, in turn, collectively have a materially adverse impact on us as a whole.

The valuation model is predominantly based on the present value of net cash flows to be generated from the property in question, taking into account expected rental growth rates, vacancy periods, occupancy rates, lease incentive costs such as rent-free periods and other costs not paid by tenants, as well as capex and maintenance expenses related to the property. In specific cases the appraisers use special assumptions, assuming facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date or that would not be made by a typical market participant in a transaction on the valuation date. The expected net cash flows are discounted using risk-adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate estimation considers the quality of a building and its location, tenant credit quality, lease duration and terms, and the interest rate environment. Due to the current Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel), we have significantly decreased our maintenance and capital expenditure in relation to our property portfolio located in Berlin, which could lead to higher capex and maintenance expenses in the future in order to safeguard or reestablish the quality of the affected properties and could lead to a decrease of the fair value of our Berlin property portfolio. Establishing the valuation parameters involves substantial judgment and such judgments may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, any change to valuation methodology, including as a result of changes to the statutory requirements, may result in gains or losses in our financial statements, based on the change to each property’s valuation compared with prior valuations. There can be no assurance that any particular valuation could be realized in a third-party sale. When evaluating our properties, we engage third-party appraisers. The valuations given to properties by thirdparty appraisers and reflected in our financial statements and in this Offering Memorandum may exceed or be below the actual amount of net proceeds which would be realized on the relevant property at the time of any sale, and are subject to fluctuation over time. Such variations may be driven by factors outside of our control and we may not be able to realize the full property value reflected in any valuation report. The fair value determination also reflects not only the circumstances directly connected with the property but also the general conditions of the real estate markets, such as regional market developments and general economic conditions or interest rate levels. Accordingly, there is a risk that in the event of a downturn in the real estate market where the property is located or in the general economic situation, we will need to revise downward the value of our portfolio. In addition, rising interest rates generally may have a negative influence on the fair value of property portfolios, and may impact the value of our real estate portfolio (see “We are _exposed to certain risks in connection with construction projects, including construction defects, availability of contractors, cost-overruns as well as health, safety and environmental risks.”)._ Any change in fair value must be recognized as a profit or loss under the fair value adjustment.

Furthermore, as of June 30, 2020, the total amount of Consus Real Estate’s net financial liabilities was €2,617 million. Our business model is also based on leveraging our properties. When concluding financing agreements or extending such agreements, we depend on our ability to agree on terms and conditions pertaining to interest payments that will not impair our targeted profit, and to amortization schedules that do not restrict our ability to pay intended dividends. As of June 30, 2020, more than half of our outstanding financing arrangements expire in or after 2023. As of the same date, €731 million of Consus Real Estate’s outstanding financing arrangements expire in or after 2023. Currently, the European Central Bank’s lead rate is at a historic low, thus favorably impacting interest rates charged by banks. This trend, however, may reverse itself, resulting in an increase in both interest rates and financing costs. The global financial and economic crisis has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding future economic developments. This uncertainty regarding the general economic outlook has increased the popularity of investment opportunities that provide stable and largely predictable cash flows, such as investments in German residential real estate, especially in the current low-interest rate environment. The resulting increased popularity of investments in residential real estate has resulted in an increase in property prices and the value of residential real estate companies. These developments could reverse themselves if, for example, interest rates were to rise, which could adversely impact us in a number of ways. For example, the Fair Value recorded on the Company’s balance sheet in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 40 in conjunction with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) 13 tends to increase in an environment of rising interest rates, which in turn could result in our properties having a lower Fair Value.

We may also require additional capital to finance or refinance our debt, capital expenditures, future acquisitions and working capital requirements. In order to undertake our planned programs such as refurbishment, and to acquire further real estate portfolios, we will likewise need to borrow additional funds or to raise additional equity capital. The extent of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors which are beyond our control, and our ability to meet such capital requirements will depend on future operating performance and ability to generate cash flows. Additional sources of financing may include equity, hybrid debt/equity and debt financings or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows or if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from future equity or debt financings or at acceptable interest rates, we may not be able to pay our debts when due or to fund other liquidity needs which would severely limit our operating flexibility.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

As of June 30, 2020, the total of our existing financial liabilities amounted to €5,884 million with an average interest rate of 1.8%. As of the same date, €2,456 million of this amount was due until the end of 2022, €1,824 million between 2023 and the end of 2024, and €1,626 million only from 2025. Furthermore, as of June 30, 2020, Consus Real Estate’s total existing net financial liabilities amounted to €2,617 million. As of June 30, 2020, our LTV-Ratio was 53.5%, compared to a LTV-Ratio of 38.0% as of June 30, 2019, with the increase mainly attributable to adjustments as a result of the sale of approximately 5,900 residential apartments to GEWOBAG Wohnungsbau-Aktiengesellschaft Berlin (the “Gewobag Sale”) and the first-time consolidation of ADLER Real Estate. Consus Real Estate’s pro forma net LTV ratio (i.e. the ratio of net debt to value of real estate assets as adjusted for certain divestments) was 83.0% as of June 30, 2020 and its net LTV ratio (i.e. the ratio of net debt to value of real estate assets) was 84.0% as of June 30, 2019. Our ability to refinance financial obligations by taking on new debt or extending existing loans could be impeded as a result of our level of debt, changes to refinancing conditions or the general market environment that is impacted by the Coronavirus. Although not currently the case, our level of debt could lead banks to refuse to grant new loans, to make new loans available to us only on less favorable financial ----- terms, to refuse to extend existing credit lines, to extend them only on less favorable terms or to require additional security. Our existing debt facilities require compliance with certain financial and maintenance covenants, some of which require us not to exceed a certain maximum loan-to-value and/or require us to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio. Our failure to comply with such covenants could trigger the respective creditor’s right to terminate the relevant financing arrangement or require us to repay part of our debt to cure a breach in the covenants or may lead to higher interest payments. Various loans that the Company’s subsidiaries obtain are secured by mortgages on real estate owned by us. Although we seek to obtain mortgages securing indebtedness which encumber only the particular real estate to which the indebtedness relates, certain loans may be collateralized by other real estate as well. If recourse on any loan incurred to acquire or refinance any particular property includes other properties, the equity in such other real estate could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on the relevant loan. If a loan is secured by a mortgage on a single property, we could lose that property through foreclosure if we default on that loan. If we were to default on a loan, we could become involved in litigation related to matters concerning the loan, and such litigation could result in significant costs. Certain situations or events allow our creditors to terminate certain debt facilities even without a breach of covenant, for example, if our economic situation is adversely affected. Any such event could cause all debt outstanding under the relevant facility to become immediately due and payable, and there could be cross defaults under other financing agreements, for example, due to an event of default under another financing agreement or the non-payment of amounts due and payable. If we are forced to repay one or more of our financial obligations early or on short notice, whether due to default, cross default, or otherwise, we might be unable to do so, we might be able to do so only by refinancing on significantly less favorable economic terms or we may be forced to sell some or all of the assets comprising our real estate portfolio. In addition, as of June 30, 2020, 54.0% of our assets served as collateral to our lenders to secure our financial obligations. Creditors might also be able to seize significant amounts of the assets that we have pledged as collateral under certain of these financing agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

To cover the Company’s operating costs, it relies on, among other things, distributions that it receives from its subsidiaries and other investment interests or, as the case may be, scheduled repayments of loans it has granted to its subsidiaries. The distributions by its subsidiaries depend, in-turn, on the subsidiaries’ operating results and their ability to make those distributions under applicable law and potential restrictions of existing and future loan contracts, including the consent of banks to the distribution of surplus cash or the repayment of shareholder loans. Such funds, and the ability to source cash from subsidiaries, may not be sufficient in the future to satisfy all of its payment obligations. If the funds are insufficient, the Company would need to obtain additional funds to be able to pay dividends. ----- Additionally, the Company requires sufficient distributable results and/or distributable reserves in order to be able to pay out a dividend. In principle, the Company intends to pay out a dividend in the amount of up to 50% of FFO 1. The lack of distributable results and/or distributable reserves may hinder the payment of a dividend even if there is sufficient cash to cover a potential dividend payment. Negative developments in connection with any such factors or at the level of each subsidiary, including any impairment of the ability by such subsidiary to continue making distributions of cash to the Company, could force it to sell properties or borrow money on unfavorable terms. We will most likely refrain from paying dividends if available cash is insufficient for the payment thereof.

Although we typically hedge our variable interest rate financing agreements using customary market hedging instruments, the hedging instruments that we use may not completely counterbalance a potential change in interest rates or may not match the loan maturity. As of June 30, 2020, a part of our loans that carried a variable interest rate, totaling a book value of €123 million, was hedged. The valuation of hedging instruments itself depends on the level of interest rates, impacting our equity and, to a lesser extent, our results of operations. A similar decrease in the interest rate would have resulted in the opposite, but even more pronounced, effect, meaning it would have had a negative impact on our equity and a positive effect on our results of operations and our net assets. Further, we may be unable to enter into, or only at significantly higher costs, extensions or renegotiations of hedging instruments that may become necessary given the interest rate terms at the relevant time. We are exposed to the risk that our hedging counterparties will not perform their obligations as established by the hedging agreements into which we have entered. Hedging counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or for other reasons. Following the recent financial crises, the risk of counterparty default has become increasingly relevant. Market conditions have led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent businesses and financial institutions under distressed conditions in recent years. Further, in case of negative floating interest rates we are obliged under hedging agreements in form of swaps to pay an additional amount to the respective hedge counterparty.

According thereto, as of June 30, 2020, the fair value of the development properties owned by the Consus Group was €3.0 billion. Valuations are based on assumptions that could subsequently turn out to be incorrect. The recording of investment properties at the cost of acquisition or production occurs only at the time the property is received. On the balance sheet dates subsequent to the accession of the property, the fair value of the property is used. The equity attributable to shareholders calculated on the basis of the best practice recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) (amended for the value from the revaluation of trading properties and adjusted for deferred taxes, the fair value of derivative financial instruments) (“EPRA NAV”) reflects the fair value of net assets on an ongoing and long-term basis. As of June 30, 2020, the EPRA NAV of our real estate properties amounted to €3,755 million. With effect as from January 1, 2020, EPRA developed new ratios to reflect changes in the regulatory framework in Europe. As a result of these changes, EPRA NAV will be replaced by, among others, a ratio that highlights the value of net assets on a long-term basis, where assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallize in normal circumstances, such as the fair value of financial derivatives and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses are excluded and where, in an effort to reflect the value required to rebuild the company, related costs, including real estate transfer taxes, are included (“EPRA NRV”). We believe that a significant difference between EPRA NAV and EPRA NRV involves the real estate transfer tax of the properties held. While real estate transfer tax was deducted for property valuation purposes under EPRA NAV, real estate transfer tax is included for property valuation purposes under EPRA NRV in an effort to reflect the low likeliness of property sales in the current market environment. For purposes of comparability, the ADLER Group intends to continue to report EPRA NAV for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, the EPRA NRV of our real estate properties amounted to €4,318 million. The best evidence of fair value is supplied by, for example, the general market environment, interest rate levels, the creditworthiness of the tenants, conditions in the rental market and the quality and potential development of the locations. The valuation of real estate is therefore subject to numerous uncertainties. The past or future assumptions underlying the property valuations may later be determined to be erroneous. In particular, there can be no certainty regarding the potential economic effects and outcomes of the Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel) (or any future legislative decisions to restrict or limit rents chargeable for residential units) on the valuations or any potential future revision thereof. Accordingly, there is a risk that if a downturn occurs in the real estate market or the general economic situation, we may need to revise downward the values of our total portfolio on the consolidated statement of financial position. Any change in fair value must be recognized as a profit or loss under the fair value adjustment. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we recognized a profit due to a change in fair value of € 141 million, while profit recognized due to a change in fair value amounted to €462 million in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The valuation of real estate is based on multiple factors that also include the appraiser’s subjective judgment. In valuing properties, the appraisers are required to make certain key assumptions in respect of matters including, but not limited to, the existence of willing buyers, title to the property, condition of structure and services, deleterious materials, environmental matters, legal matters, statutory and regulatory requirements and ----- planning, transaction pricing, estimated market rental values, market yields, expected future rental revenues from the property and other factors. The adoption of different assumptions would be likely to produce different valuation results and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate and could negatively affect the valuation of our properties. Property valuations are complex, involve the use of data which is not publicly available and involve a degree of subjective professional judgment by the appraiser. As a result, any valuation presents the external appraiser’s best estimate of the value of our properties or acquisition targets. However, there can be no assurance that the valuations accurately reflect the actual sale proceeds that will be achieved upon a sale (or purchase) of the properties valued, even where any such transaction occurs shortly after the relevant valuation date, and particularly if, due to unforeseen circumstances, we would be forced to sell (or purchase) properties under unfavorable conditions. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the estimated yields and estimated rental values will prove to be achievable. Any deviation between the valuations of our properties or acquisition targets to the reflected value of the underlying properties may require us to make significant fair value adjustments in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Regulatory and Legal Risks,13.4.1,German laws protecting residential tenants and existing restrictions on the rate of rental increases could make it more difficult to increase the rents of residential units we own.,"In Germany, the landlord-tenant relationship is subject to a significant level of statutory regulation which, for the most part, provides far-reaching social protection for tenants under residential leases. According to German law, for example, a landlord may not increase residential rents by more than an aggregate of 20% over a threeyear period in general and by no more than an aggregate of 15% in Berlin. If the parties to a tenancy agreement have not agreed on a gradual rent (Staffelmiete) or an index-linked rent (Indexmiete), which is only permissible within certain limits and unusual in residential leases, and the tenant refuses to amend the tenancy agreement, a rent increase may be effected unilaterally within the statutory and contractual limits set forth in the respective rent index (Mietspiegel), or for those units that were modernized or to compensate for certain necessary construction measures. Following a rent increase, the tenants may have a special termination right. The Berlin municipality publishes a new qualified rent index every two years. The latest update of the rent index for Berlin has been published on May 13, 2019. The average residential rents in Berlin increased in the time period 2017 – 2019 by 2.5% per year whereas in the time period from 2015 – 2017 the increase was at a level of 4.6 % per year. In addition to the generally applicable rent increase restrictions as mentioned above, we are subject to additional restraints on rent increases arising from the acquisition agreements through which the respective real estate portfolio or property for privatization was purchased. Such restrictions limit our ability to impose rent increases as the increase may not exceed the average cost of living index for a defined amount. Further mandatory legal provisions impose occupancy restrictions on landlords who have received public subsidies with regard to residential units. As of June 30, 2020, 4.2% (by sqm) of our residential units were subject to rent restrictions that stem from public subsidies, accounting for 3.6% of our total rental income. The assumptions in our business plan with respect to the effect of occupancy rights and restrictions on rent increases may prove to be inaccurate. To the extent that the assumptions made are inaccurate, our rental income and operating profit may not grow over time or not as quickly as we have assumed or may remain static. Affordable housing has been and continues to be a political topic of controversial discussion in Berlin and throughout Germany. During the last couple of years, legislative developments have adversely affected our business. For example, in 2011 the parliament of the State of Berlin passed a law on social housing ----- (Wohnraumgesetz Berlin) that provides for, inter alia, stricter rules on rent restrictions for recipients of certain public housing subsidies. Furthermore, this legislation allows tenants of state-subsidized housing to terminate the existing letting contract in certain cases of rent increases, within a period of three months. Moreover, changes to the legal framework may further negatively impact our ability to increase rents. Affordable housing continues to be a political topic that attracts a high level of attention. German residential landlord tenant law (Wohnraummietrecht) is considered to be tenant friendly in many respects, including limits on the amount of rent chargeable. Restrictions and ceilings for existing and new leases, such as the rent cap (Mietpreisbremse) and the rent freeze (Mietendeckel), as well as restrictions on rent increases following modernization of the properties in accordance with the German Tenancy Adjustment Act (Mietrechtsanpassungsgesetz), which came into force in January 2019, are further examples for restrictions on rent increases. The German Act on Curbing Rent Increases in Tight Housing Markets and the Strengthening of the Orderer Principle with respect to the Business of Rental Agents—Tenancy Law Amendment Act (Gesetz zur Dämpfung _des Mietanstiegs auf angespannten Wohnungsmärkten und zur Stärkung des Bestellerprinzips bei der Wohnungsvermittlung—Mietrechtsnovellierungsgesetz) (“MietNovG”) entered into force on June 1, 2015. A_ provision of MietNovG that authorizes the German federal state governments to determine areas with a tight housing market already entered into force on April 27, 2015. A decree declaring Berlin as an area with a tight housing market was issued by the Berlin government on April 28, 2015. One of the main topics of MietNovG is a cap on rents for new leases (Mietpreisbremse). This rent cap provides that, subject to certain exceptions such as the first-time lease of newly build apartments, no rent may exceed the local comparative rent by a maximum of 10% in case of new lettings of residential units in areas designated as a tight residential rental market. However, the rent cap only applies if the federal states have implemented ordinances designating areas as tight residential rental market. In addition, the German Tenancy Adjustment Act tightens the provisions for implementing the rent cap at the expense of landlords. According to the new provisions, landlords are obliged in certain cases to provide a tenant with unsolicited information on the rent achieved for the apartment prior to the conclusion of the rental agreement. In addition, it has been made easier for tenants to make a complaint based on the rent cap. Whereas tenants previously had to submit a qualified complaint, which had to contain the facts on which the complaint was based, a simple complaint is sufficient under the new law. On June 18, 2019, Berlin’s municipal government (Berliner Senat) announced its intention to freeze rents in Berlin for the next five years. The so-called “Mietendeckel” was passed on January 30, 2020 by Berlin’s parliament (Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus) and entered into force on February 23, 2020. On the basis of the Law on Rent Limitation in Housing in Berlin (Gesetz zur Mietenbegrenzung im Wohnungswesen in Berlin – _MietenWoG Bln) (the “Berlin Rent Limitation Law”), the rents for living space in Berlin (except for subsidized_ and newly built living space) shall be capped retrospectively as of June 18, 2019. Among other things, the passed law provides that the administration can take action ex officio against landlords in the event of violations of the permitted rent amount. An application by the tenant to lower the rent to the permissible level, as was provided for by the draft law of the Berlin municipal government (Berliner Senat), is not necessary. Furthermore, violations of the rent freeze in connection with existing rents and future rent increases, insofar as these exceed the limits intended by the rent freeze constitute administrative offenses. These administrative offenses may be punished with fines of up to €500,000 per individual case. In case we have agreed on provisions in individual or a multitude of cases in connection with our approximately 17,710 existing leases as of June 30, 2020 or with new leases, by which we would violate the provisions of the Berlin Rent Limitation Law or comparable laws that restrict or lower the current rent level, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The ADLER Group and the ADLER Real Estate Group combined generated approximately €147.0 million rental income in the six-month period June 30, 2020, or 28.6% of its total net rental income in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, exposed to the “Mietendeckel” regulation. We expect the combined impact of such regulation to result in a decrease of rental income in the amount of approximately €1 million for 2020 and €9 million for 2021, mostly due to the reversion of rents to the maximum levels as of November 2020. On May 6, 2020, certain members of the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) filed an application for judicial review (Normenkontrollantrag) with the German Federal Constitutional Court ----- (Bundesverfassungsgericht) to ascertain the compliance of the Berlin Rent Limitation Law with German federal constitutional law. Any further tightening of existing or the introduction of additional rent restrictions could limit our ability to implement an increase in rental costs across any part of or all of our portfolio and, ultimately, negatively affect our strategy. Any failure to comply with or violation of legislation regarding rent restrictions could result in our obligation to repay any surplus rents charged and, additionally, to pay substantial fines. Furthermore, any other cap, tenant-friendly regulation or regulation serving the protection of tenants may considerably impair our ability to raise rents. Further, German law and German courts provide tenants with protection against tenant evictions. Delayed evictions resulting from these protections can lead to substantial losses until the property is actually vacated.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Any changes to German or European laws, which could include changes that have retroactive effect, or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws could, therefore, have a negative effect on our business. Changes to tenant protection laws could make it more difficult to evict tenants, increase rents or pass on ancillary costs or modernization investment costs to the tenants. This could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our investments, results of operations and prospects. More restrictive environmental laws could also result in additional expenses. For example, since 2011, owners of specified centralized heated water supply facilities for use in multi-family residential units are obliged to test the level of potential legionella contamination at least every three years, thereby incurring additional costs for the testing as well as for remediation measures, if contamination is detected. Additional costs would also be incurred if the legal requirements relating to the construction and use of existing properties were to become more onerous. Construction and environmental requirements are of particular significance in this context. For example, the currently applicable version of the German Energy Savings Regulation (Energieeinsparverordnung) prescribes specified investments into renovation aimed at reducing energy consumption (for instance, with respect to thermal insulation) and requires a landlord to present an energy certificate that discloses the property’s energy efficiency to a potential tenant prior to entering into a new lease agreement. The same applies with respect to the sale of properties. Additionally, requirements may be imposed in order to increase the availability of disabled-accessible and adapted housing. Furthermore, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) is currently in the process of implementing the German Building Electromobility Infrastructure Act (Gebäude-Elektromobilitätsinfrastruktur-Gesetz) (the “GEIG”) to implement the EU Building Directive 2018/844 into national law. According to the GEIG, new residential buildings or existing residential buildings that undergo a significant renovation (i.e., a renovation that affects over 25% of the surface of the building shell) and that have more than ten parking spaces, must ensure that such parking spaces are equipped with electric charging capabilities. In addition, we could be adversely affected by changes to public building law which could restrict our ability to manage our properties in the way we had previously expected. On March 3, 2015, the Berlin government passed a regulation (Umwandlungsverordnung) according to which a conversion of a building into condominiums is prohibited in milieu protection areas (Milieuschutzgebiete) of the city unless the relevant district has granted permission by means of an exception to this regulation. This regulation expired on March 13, 2020, but was renewed on the same date. The landlords of rented apartments require an exception permission (Ausnahmebewilligung) by the relevant district to sell the apartment. Such exception permissions may be granted, for example, in case that the apartment shall be sold to the current tenant within seven years following the conversion. Although this does not affect the sale of an entire property, regulation may hinder the conversion and sale of single apartments. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, 63 areas of Berlin are defined as milieu protection areas (Milieuschutzgebiete), within which 6,239 units of our real estate portfolios are located. The Berlin government may, on an ongoing basis, decide to extend milieu protection (Milieuschutz). ----- If, in the course of a refurbishment or modernization, it should be discovered that a building undergoing said processes is subject to monument protection laws, the need to comply with monument protection requirements could lead to significant delays in the refurbishment or modernization process, in the inability to carry out particular refurbishment or modernization measures, and also in significantly higher costs for the particular project.

In addition, the EU recently enacted Regulation 2016/679/EU of April 27, 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation) (the “GDPR”). The GDPR automatically came into effect in all EU member states as of May 25, 2018, and imposed stricter conditions and limitations in relation to the processing, use and transmission of personal data. The GDPR introduced extensive documentation obligations and considerably higher transparency requirements, which affect not only initial data collection but also the monitoring and investigation once personal data has been collected. We may not have prepared for these changes to the extent necessary and our preparations may not yield the expected results. Additionally, although we strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and legal obligations relating to data usage and data protection, it is possible that these laws, regulations and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations and other legal obligations. Our process of developing and advancing our data protection standards and procedures may take longer and require more resources than originally planned. Any non-compliance by us with the applicable regulations could lead to fines and other sanctions. For example, the GDPR provides that violations can be fined, depending on the circumstances, by up to the higher of €20 million and 4% of the annual global turnover of the non-compliant company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

For instance, as of June 30, 2020, 1,244 units of our real estate portfolio, accounting for 7.6% of our rental income as of the same date, are situated in preservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) within Berlin, which imposes certain restrictions on the use and refurbishment of property. Such restrictions require, for example, obtaining the public authority’s permission prior to entering into a lease agreement with a term longer than one year or selling the property. In addition, once the redevelopment has been completed, the municipality levies a compensation charge to reflect the increased value of the land due to the redevelopment. Any administrative decision that would affect our ability to conduct our business at our discretion could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

As our business involves a large number of individual units and tenants, each with a relatively small individual value, we maintain numerous legal relationships, in particular with tenants, contractors and service providers, any one of which is not financially material to us. As a means of efficiently managing these legal relationships, we often make use of standardized documents and form contracts. In addition, we have adopted long-term standardized lease agreements through our various acquisitions. These documents and contracts often contain ambiguities or errors, and the fact that any given document or contract is standardized may cause a significant number of contractual terms or even the validity of a large number of contracts to be affected. Due to frequent changes in the law, particularly in case law regarding general terms and conditions (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen), the use of such standardized contractual terms is not without risk. For example, it is possible that, as a result of ----- changes to statutes or case law, ambiguities or errors in standard contract terms may give rise to claims or cause such subsidiaries to lose certain rights and privileges, or to lose their right to claim damages which could, in turn, adversely affect our rental income and operating profit. Even in the case of contracts being prepared with legal advice, it is impossible for us to avoid problems of this nature in advance or in the future, because changes could occur in the legal framework, particularly via case law, making it impossible for us to avoid the ensuing legal disadvantages.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

A certain number of our assets are listed in the register of contaminated sites. Buildings and their fixtures might also contain asbestos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, polychlorinated biphenyl, pentachlorophenol and lindane above the allowable or recommended thresholds, or the buildings could bear other environmental risks, e.g. flooring material containing asbestos (i.e. “Floorflex” flooring). In total, as of June 30, 2020, 5.7% of our residential real estate units (by sqm) and 6.8% of our commercial real estate units (by sqm) were identified as containing this flooring material. For example, certain of our properties contain asbestos contamination which, from time to time, requires us to do refurbishments. In particular, we have received notice that one of our buildings contains substantial asbestos contamination for which we expect significant refurbishment expenses. Refurbishment and removal of this material takes place regularly as part of our maintenance and repair efforts and the costs for these regular removals are reflected in our budgeting. Moreover, we own or may acquire properties that may contain undetected hazardous substances, such as lead from pipes in buildings built around the turn of the nineteenth century and legionella (see “Our business is subject to the general legal environment _in Germany. Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel or other regulation, may be detrimental to us.”), which are harmful to the health of the residents or_ contain such other environmental risks or contain substances which are not yet viewed as being harmful to the health of the residents, and are therefore not being categorized as hazardous. These materials may be detected or categorized as hazardous, and we may be obliged to remove and dispose of such materials. We bear the risk of cost-intensive assessment, remediation or removal of such ground, soil or water contamination, hazardous substances, wartime ordnance or other residual pollution. The discovery of any such residual pollution on the sites and/or in the buildings, particularly in connection with the letting or sale of properties or borrowing using the real estate as security, could trigger claims for rent reductions, the termination of letting contracts for cause or for damages and other breach of warranty claims against us. The remediation of any pollution and the related additional measures we would have to undertake could negatively affect us and could involve considerable additional costs that we may have to bear. We are also exposed to the risk that recourse against the polluter or the previous owners of the properties might not be possible, for example, because they cannot be identified, no longer exist or have become insolvent. Moreover, the existence or even the mere suspicion of the existence of ground contamination, hazardous materials, wartime ordnance or other residual pollution can negatively affect the value of a property and our ability to let or sell such a property. Moreover, environmental laws impose actual and contingent obligations on us to undertake remedial action on contaminated sites and in contaminated buildings. These obligations may relate to properties we currently own or operate, properties we have formerly owned or operated or properties where waste has been deposited. Furthermore, actions for damages or remediation measures may be brought against us, namely under the German Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundesbodenschutzgesetz). According to this Act, not only the polluter but also its legal successor, the owner of the contaminated site and certain previous owners may be held liable for soil and pond water contamination. The costs of any removal, investigation or remediation of any residual pollution on such sites or in such buildings as well as costs related to legal proceedings, including potential damages, regarding such matters may be substantial, and it may be impossible, for a number of reasons, for us to have recourse against a former seller of a contaminated site or building or the party that may otherwise be responsible for the contamination. Laws and regulations, as may be amended over time, may also impose liability for the ----- release of certain materials into the air or water from a property, including chrysotile containing materials (CCM), and such release could form the basis for liability to third parties for personal injury or other damages. In addition, if our employees infringe or have infringed environmental protection laws, we could be exposed to civil or criminal damages. We may be required to provide for additional reserves to sufficiently allocate toward our potential obligations to remove and dispose of any hazardous and toxic substances. Our business is also exposed to the risk of non-compliance with building codes or environmental regulations, including those applicable in Berlin. Even though we usually conduct inspections during the acquisition of individual properties, there is a risk that building codes or environmental regulations have not been complied with. It is also possible that landlord responsibilities could be further expanded with respect to fire protection and environmental protection, which could require additional refurbishment, maintenance and modernization requirements. Furthermore, the projected cost of such measures is based on the assumption that the required permits are issued promptly and that they are consistent with our plans. It is possible, however, that the required building permits will not always be issued in due course. If such permits are not issued promptly, or are issued only subject to conditions, this can lead to substantial delays in correcting the problems and result in higher than projected costs and lower rental income for the relevant properties.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have two pending requests for the issuance of building permits, comprising a total of 1,382 sqm. In addition, special permissions could be required and must be obtained, particularly for measures taking place in urban redevelopment areas (Sanierungsgebiete) or preservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) and for real estates and buildings which are protected historic monuments. If we are not granted a building permit or another required permit, or a building permit or another required permit is granted only subject to onerous conditions, the rental income that we expect to generate from the relevant real estate could be considerably less than originally calculated. If a renovation project becomes financially unfeasible because a building permit or another required permit is not granted or is granted only subject to onerous conditions, we may not be able to or decide to not carry out the project and any expenditure already incurred may be lost. Moreover, changes in the requirements for construction or modernization of existing real estate could result in unforeseen additional costs. Any increase in operating costs resulting from the above-described events would adversely affect our operating profit.

The resulting obligations usually continue to exist after the sale, for a period of several years. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we have sold 13 and 62 residential units of our units held for privatization, respectively. In particular, we could be subject to claims for damages from purchasers, who could assert that we failed to meet our obligations, or that the representations we made to them were untrue. We could be required to make payments to the purchasers following legal disputes or litigation. If we do not have cash available to conduct such litigation or make such payments, we may be required to borrow funds, or, if we are unable to borrow funds to make such payments, we may be forced to sell investments to obtain such funds, which would in turn cause reduced levels of rental income and operating profit. If we provide warranties to third parties in connection with maintenance and modernization measures and claims are asserted against us because of defects, it is not always certain that we will have recourse against the companies that performed the work. As a seller of properties, we are also liable to tenants for any breach of tenancy agreements by the buyer under certain circumstances, even where we no longer have any control over the property. Moreover, we continue to be exposed to liability for breach of contract even if the buyer resells the property and the subsequent buyer breaches any tenancy agreement. If, however, we notify the tenant of the change in ownership and the tenant fails to avail itself of the opportunity to terminate the tenancy at the earliest permitted termination date, we are, ----- in general, released from liability. As a rule, when selling properties, we inform all tenants in writing of the change in landlord either alone or together with the acquirer. Such release from liability does not apply to security deposits _(Mietbürgschaften) provided by the tenants. If the tenant is unable to receive its security deposit from the buyer of the property, the liability to repay such security deposit remains with the seller. In connection with any of the aforementioned or similar risks, we may be facing legal or settlement costs, including the costs of defending lawsuits, whether justified or not, as well as potential damages associated with liability for properties that we have sold.

These companies have registered offices in Germany, Luxembourg and further countries of the European Union (Netherlands, Denmark, Malta and Ireland). Our companies are subject to the tax laws of their jurisdictions of registration and the jurisdictions where they conduct business. The cross-border participation of the Company in its subsidiaries provides for various tax aspects, including cross-border taxation issues governed by directives of the European Union and/or double-tax treaties between Luxembourg and the jurisdictions of the subsidiaries. It cannot be excluded that tax authorities in the countries in which we are active may not share the view of our tax assessment, which could lead to additional tax burdens for us in any of these countries. For example, in the course of our business, we have entered into several cross-border financing transactions and any change or different treatment in the tax treatment in this context may have adverse tax effects. The same applies to the non-deductibility or requalification of intragroup loans and financings with third parties, intragroup payments for services, the different interpretation of the tax residency of a subsidiary, the assumption of a permanent establishment, the non-recognition of the VAT group with regard to the group companies or the non-granting of the so-called further reduction for the German real estate companies. Also, the tax laws in any of these jurisdictions or double-tax treaties between these countries could change in the future, even with retroactive effect, which could cause additional tax burdens for us. Moreover, some of our group companies have significant tax loss carry forwards (“Tax Losses”) in an amount above €1 million.

Some of these Tax Losses may have been or may be forfeited in whole or in part in the past or future, as a result of past restructurings, the initial public offering in July 2015 or future changes of the shareholders. In particular, any past or future corporate reorganization within the Group or relating to the Company’s shareholding structure may result in the partial or complete forfeiture of the Tax Losses (to the extent the Tax Losses are not covered by taxable hidden reserves in our assets). With regard to the migration of the Company from Cyprus to Luxembourg, we have received a binding ruling that no German Real Estate Transfer Tax (“RETT”) (Grunderwerbsteuer) has been triggered but did not apply for a ruling regarding impact on the Tax Losses.

Our tax burden primarily depends on various aspects of tax laws, as well as their application and interpretation. Amendments to tax laws may have a retroactive effect, and the application or interpretation of tax laws by tax authorities or courts may change. Furthermore, court decisions are occasionally limited to their specific facts by tax authorities. Any of these developments may increase or alter our tax burden. A number of factors may also impact our tax situation. For example, due to the Coronavirus, the managing directors of ADO Group Ltd. are currently residing in Germany and cannot travel to Israel. Therefore, all management decisions are taken in Germany and not Israel and the Israeli tax authority may come to the conclusion that this continued situation may trigger an Israeli exit-tax. Furthermore, we are required to file tax declarations in Luxembourg, Germany and further countries of the European Union as well as Israel, from time to time, and any tax assessments that deviate from our tax declarations may increase or alter our tax obligations. Our individual entities are regularly subject to tax audits by the competent tax authorities which may result in increases in our tax obligations or penalties and fines.

We currently hold real estate in Germany and shares in companies which own real estate in Germany. In Germany, the transfer of real estate or of a 95% or greater interest in a company that owns real estate triggers a potential liability for RETT. It cannot be excluded that RETT will be triggered post-Completion, upon an acquisition of additional shares in ADLER Real Estate after the Completion or the reorganization of the ADLER Group. Because of the complexity of the RETT laws in Germany, we may from time to time seek to acquire properties with less than a 95% stake in the ownership company. This may result in an increased complexity of the transaction and stronger minority rights of the associate parties. As a consequence, transaction costs and future ----- administrative expenses for the newly acquired property would generally rise, too. Recently proposed changes to German RETT laws aim to tighten the statutory RETT framework with regard to share deals. Accordingly, share deals that do not trigger any RETT may no longer be possible in the future or such acquisitions might be more difficult. In broad terms these proposals are to (i) extend the stricter partnership RETT rules to incorporated companies; (ii) reduce the economic ownership threshold upon which RETT is triggered from 95% of the shares or interest in a property company, as it is currently, to 90%; and (iii) extend the 5 year cooling period to 10 years. As a result, RETT will be payable unless the seller retains over 10% of the shares or interest in a property company for at least 10 years. While the draft bill originally stipulated that the respective legislative changes shall come into force in January 2020, it was announced at the end of 2019 by the political parties currently forming the German government that the intended changes to RETT will not come into force as of January 1, 2020 as originally planned. It is currently unclear if and to which extent such changes will enter into force at a later stage potentially with retroactive effect.

Accordingly, the Company may make an offer to all shareholders of Consus Real Estate to purchase their shares in Consus Real Estate by way of a voluntary public exchange offer (the “Consus Offer”), subject to market conditions. The Consus Offer would be based on an exchange ratio, adjusted for the issue of 30,819,391 newly issued shares in dematerialized form with no nominal value in connection with a capital increase against contribution in cash with subscription rights for existing shareholders of the Company and gross proceeds in an amount of €457 million, which was settled on July 24, 2020 (the “Rights Issue”), of one share in Consus Real Estate for 0.272 newly issued shares in the Company as consideration. Gröner Group GmbH has irrevocably undertaken to accept the Consus Offer in relation to a shareholding of 15.3% in Consus Real Estate. Alternatively, the Company may seek to amend the Call/Put-Option Agreement and enter into a share purchase agreement regarding Gröner Group GmbH’s shareholding of 20.5% in Consus Real Estate in lieu of Gröner Group GmbH accepting the Consus Offer, whereby the Company would acquire all shares held by Gröner Group GmbH in Consus Real Estate against transfer of newly issued shares in the Company as consideration. The new shares would be created by way of a capital increase without subscription rights against contribution in kind. The Consus Real Estate Acquisition and the Consus Offer are part of our strategy to benefit from access to Consus Real Estate’s development platform with a pipeline of over 15,000 residential rental units that is focused on Berlin, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dresden, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich and Stuttgart (together, the “Top 9 Cities”). There is no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the Consus Real Estate Acquisition will be realized in full or at all. Prior to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition, we conducted a restricted due diligence on the basis of limited information. Therefore, certain important circumstances relevant for the valuation of Consus Real Estate, including its internal business operations and financial reporting, may not have been adequately or sufficiently considered. In particular, we may not have been in a position to adequately and sufficiently identify and assess all risks in connection with the Consus Real Estate Acquisition and the Consus Offer. For example, in connection with a joint venture agreement, the Consus Real Estate ----- Acquisition may have triggered a change of control under a provision that obligates the Company to present its joint venture partner with an offer to sell its participation to the Company in a multi-step procedure. In connection therewith, we could incur additional costs and be exposed to transactional and legal risks.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,Risks related to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition,13.7.2,The Consus Real Estate Acquisition exposes the Company to operational risks related to the development of real estate projects.,"The majority of Consus Real Estate’s revenue is generated from the development of real estate projects. The development of real estate projects involves specific significant risks to which the Company is exposed by way of the Consus Real Estate Acquisition. The Company may overestimate the value of and/or the business opportunities of or associated with the Consus Real Estate Acquisition due to numerous factors, in particular the inability to identify all risks associated with the development of real estate properties. Consus Real Estate’s profitability will depend on its ability to successfully acquire land plots, listed buildings and commercial real estate properties suitable for development, either through building, conversion or redevelopment, at financially attractive prices in appropriate geographic locations and at terms that are in line with its acquisition strategy and criteria. A key factor contributing to Consus Real Estate’s future growth and profitability is the ability to identify and, at financially attractive prices, acquire land plots or properties utilizing Consus Real Estate’s sourcing network, in particular through the individual contacts of its branches. There can, however, be no assurance that Consus Real Estate’s sourcing network will be able to continue identifying acquisition targets or that Consus Real Estate will be able to maintain its sourcing network in the future. In addition, Consus Real Estate’s ability to acquire land plots or real estate properties for its business may be adversely affected by the willingness of sellers to sell at financially attractive prices, the availability of acquisition financing, regulatory requirements, including those relating to building, zoning and environmental laws and various other market conditions. In addition, the emergence of competitors with similar business models and strategies may lead to an increasing demand for suitable real estate properties and may, therefore, lead to an increase in the acquisition costs for development opportunities or affect Consus Real Estate’s acquisition opportunities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that Consus Real Estate will be able to acquire any of the identified land plots or properties on attractive terms, if at all. Additionally, Consus Real Estate may not be able to secure all necessary permits on a timely basis or on economically viable terms, or at all. In connection with the acquisition of land plots or properties, Consus Real Estate is exposed to risks caused by the condition of the real estate property and the inaccurate assessment thereof. Consus Real Estate may not be able to identify all material risks in connection with the due diligence processes it conducts. Due to market competition and limited time frames between introduction of an acquisition opportunity onto the market and the transaction closing date, Consus Real Estate’s ability to evaluate acquisition opportunities and to engage in a diligent analysis of the specifics and constraints imposed by a seller may be limited. There can be no assurance that Consus Real Estate has been or will be in a position to accurately identify, examine and evaluate all risks associated with an acquisition. For example, Consus Real Estate may not be able to assess whether the original owner of an acquisition target or any potential successor has obtained, maintained or renewed all required permits, satisfied all permit conditions and obtained all necessary licenses. Acquisition targets may suffer from hidden defects, including contaminations, or damages that Consus Real Estate was not able to discover during the acquisition process. Consus Real Estate is also exposed to various risks relating to defective construction work or the use or installation of defective construction materials by third-party suppliers or contractors. The warranty, guarantee or indemnity protection set forth in Consus Real Estate’s contracts with such third-party suppliers and contractors, and the arrangements with insurance providers to insure against certain risks, may prove to be insufficient or may not adequately protect Consus Real Estate against relevant risks. Furthermore, it may not be able to enforce claims in the respective amount, or at all, due to the third-party contractor’s or supplier’s insolvency, or for other reasons. Significant liabilities may not be identified or may only come to light after the expiry of Consus Real Estate’s warranty, guarantee or indemnity claims. Any claims relating to defects arising from or related to one of Consus Real Estate’s development projects may give rise to contractual or other liabilities, which can extend, depending on the relevant contractual or statutory provisions, for five years following completion of the development project and may not be covered by claims against Consus Real Estate’s contractors or suppliers. ----- In addition, unanticipated cost overruns and substantial delays can arise in a development project due to numerous factors, including increases in the acquisition costs for land, lack of availability and increases in the costs of building materials, adverse events affecting contractors and sub-contractors (e.g. their employees not being granted entry into Germany due to the Coronavirus or their insolvency), increases in the costs of professional service providers, unidentified property defects, and unforeseen technical and ground conditions. In particular, higher building costs than expected may arise due to the current labor market in Germany, which exhibits a shortage of qualified personnel in the construction sector. Delays can also arise during the building permits application process as, for the realization of its development projects, Consus Real Estate has to acquire a variety of approvals from local authorities, including land-use plans (Bebauungspläne) and building permits (Baugenehmigungen). Any such delay could result in significant cost increases and, ultimately, negatively affect the profitability of Consus Real Estate’s business operations. Consus Real Estate sells its real estate developments to institutional purchasers by entering into forward sale agreements. Such forward sales can, in general, be delayed due to economic uncertainty and the willingness of institutional purchasers to invest may decline in an economic environment shaped by the Coronavirus. If Consus Real Estate is unable to enter into forward sale agreements, even after letters of intent were negotiated or agreed, or fulfill its obligations under the forward sale agreements by completing the respective project development as planned, that would permit it to refinance the acquisition costs and finance the development of a project, Consus Real Estate may experience delays in or fail to launch real estate development projects. In this event, it may have to hold real estate properties or real estate development projects for a longer period than anticipated at the time of acquisition, or, alternatively may have to dispose of an undeveloped real estate property at a price that may not provide an adequate return, if any, or may result in a loss. Additionally, any forward sale agreement may not materialize on the terms agreed upon, including as a result of amendments, withdrawals, failure to make payments or terminations by institutional purchasers. In the event that the purchaser withdraws from or terminates the forward-sale agreement, Consus Real Estate must bear the costs in connection with the sale of the property. Institutional purchasers are generally entitled to withdraw from the forward sale agreement if Consus Real Estate does not meet the agreed milestones, irrespective of the reasons, including delays related to the Coronavirus. For example, in October 2020, Consus Real Estate was notified that one institutional purchaser withdrew from its purchase of 205 residential apartments in the Vitopia-Campus Kaiserlei due to construction delays. In such event, Consus Real Estate is obligated to bear the costs in connection with the forward sale agreement and in most cases will also be obligated to pay compensation to the respective institutional purchaser. Furthermore, Consus Real Estate may be unable to let residential units in its developed properties as required under the respective forward sale agreement in a timely manner or at all, which in turn could impair Consus Real Estate’s ability to complete such forward sale agreement, which in aggregate, across Consus Real Estate’s various forward-sold development projects, could have a material adverse effect on its revenue and thus results of operations. Also, Consus Real Estate may not achieve the targeted rent per square meter or the targeted vacancy rate of a development as agreed under the forward sale agreement. In addition, this Offering Memorandum contains figures representing the estimated gross development value (“GDV”) of the development projects of Consus Real Estate. GDV is a measure of the total sales revenue that is expected to be generated from a project when it is fully developed. It reflects the expected sales value of the fully constructed and let development. The metric provides investors with the sense of scale of the business and of the total income to be generated from the portfolio.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,Risks related to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition,13.7.3,"Prior to the Consus Acquisition, Consus Real Estate announced various transactions, including a material divestment of real estate development projects, and could be materially adversely affected by any delay in the closing of or failure to close any of these transaction.","On May 8, 2020 and May 20, 2020, Consus Real Estate publicly announced the divestment of 17 and 8 development projects with a GDV of €2.3 billion and €2.0 billion, respectively, thereby reducing the total number of development projects and the total GDV to 39 and €8.0 billion, respectively. The divested development projects primarily comprise projects located in non-core locations and have a predominantly commercial use. Additionally, on June 22, 2020, Consus Real Estate acquired the outstanding 25% minority stake (on a fully diluted basis) of its subsidiary Consus RE GmbH (formerly Consus RE AG). The closing of each of the above transactions is subject to certain adjustments and conditions. For example, in relation to the divestment of 17 development projects, the underlying agreement provides that both seller and purchaser may rescind the agreement if the purchase price is not paid by October 30, 2020, and, in relation to the divestment of 8 development projects, the underlying agreement provides that conditions include a satisfactory purchaser due diligence, the approval of minority shareholders of certain companies sold thereunder, the consent of ----- financing banks and lenders thereunder and that all conditions must be fulfilled or waived by October 31, 2020. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, regarding each divestment, Consus Real Estate is not aware of any purchaser’s intention to not consummate the respective transaction, however, there can be no assurance that the respective rescission right will not be exercised. Consus Real Estate intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the above transactions to reduce its project finance debt. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the debt reduction as a result of the divestments, Consus Real Estate estimates that its average run-rate cost of debt decreases by 0.3% to approximately 7.4%. Any delay in the closing of or failure to close any of the above transactions could result in negative effects on and/or the failure of any anticipated positive effects on, among others, the LTV-Ratio, net debt and adjusted EBITDA of Consus Real Estate. Furthermore, as a result of such delay or failure, Consus Real Estate’s strategy to increase its focus on residential real estate in its strategic markets can be negatively affected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Its development projects require significant up-front costs to acquire and develop land plots. Following an acquisition of a land plot, Consus Real Estate incurs considerable costs before construction work commences. Real estate development projects typically require substantial capital during construction periods and Consus Real Estate is dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient capital. Consus Real Estate depends on its ability to obtain and the availability of external funding to finance its operating business. Consus Real Estate’s targeted leverage ratio will depend on, among others, the valuation of its real estate properties. In the event that such valuation decreases materially, for example, if the currently favorable economic environment for the real estate industry deteriorates, Consus Real Estate may have to refinance its current financing arrangements to continue to meet its targeted leverage ratio, which may lead to higher financing costs. Consus Real Estate may also fail to enter into new financing arrangements on terms similar to previous terms due to a decreased valuation of its real estate properties. To service and refinance its existing and future indebtedness and for current and future development projects and real estate acquisitions, Consus Real Estate is dependent on a stable cash flow. Such cash flow is influenced by various factors, including the general economic and real estate market environment in Germany, developments affecting the legal environment in Germany and other factors beyond its control. In addition, factors in relation to Consus Real Estate’s operations may negatively impact its cash flow from operating activities due to defaults of institutional purchasers in relation to down payments under forward sale agreements or cost overruns or delays in relation to Consus Real Estate’s development projects. Consus Real Estate may also incur expenditures for non-scheduled maintenance measures. Any of these or other factors may limit or prevent its ability to generate sufficient cash flow and could require that Consus Real Estate implements costcutting measures or efficiency improvements regarding operating and fundraising activities, delay capital expenditures or sell assets, each of which in turn may affect its ability to service its financial liabilities. There can be no assurance that Consus Real Estate’s cash flow generation will be sufficient to meet its financial needs and/or debt service obligations. Consus Real Estate may be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing at terms that may be economically less favorable than in the past. Any inability to source additional financing at favorable terms or at all may force Consus Real Estate to dispose of assets, or render it unable to pursue business opportunities, including the acquisition of land plots, real estate properties or real estate companies. Additionally, in the event that a liquidity shortage occurs, Consus Real Estate may be forced to restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt, including convertible bonds, notes or other financial instruments that it may have issued in the past. It may be required to agree upon terms and conditions which are unfavorable to its business and which are a likely to restrict its business activities even further. Additional debt may negatively affect key financial figures, such as market LTV ratio, which describes the ratio of net debt to the fair value of investment properties and inventories. Such figures are typically referred to in the covenants included in Consus Real Estate’s financial agreements. Consus Real Estate currently has and is expected to continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding debt. As of June 30, 2020, Consus Real Estate’s total financing liabilities amounted to €2,720 million, consisting of non-current financing liabilities in the amount of €1,440 million and current financing liabilities in the amount ----- of €1,281 million. A high level of financial debt may, among others, require Consus Real Estate to dedicate a substantial part of its cash flow to debt repayment (thereby reducing the free cash flow available to fund internal growth through capital expenditure and to pursue business opportunities), restrict its ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity at reasonably economic terms, if at all, and, ultimately, will make Consus Real Estate more susceptible to a downturn in the real estate industry and/or general economic conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Goodwill is recognized as an intangible asset and is subject to an impairment review, which takes place at least annually, or upon the occurrence of significant events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment. For purposes of impairment testing following an acquisition, goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating unit (usually a country or a region) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. In testing goodwill, economic factors play an important role, including the global economic development or interest rates. Any negative development in relation to economic factors could necessitate an impairment test and require Consus Real Estate to reduce its goodwill or such reduction may occur during the annual impairment review.

Some of the corresponding financing agreements and certain other agreements of Consus Real Estate include so-called change-of-control provisions that are triggered by the Consus Real Estate Acquisition and provide the other parties to the agreements with a right to demand early redemption or to declare the termination. Additionally, any financing agreement and other agreement entered into by Consus Real Estate could include additional termination rights that may be triggered in connection with the Consus Real Estate Acquisition (such as, among others, cross-default provisions that allow the lender to accelerate a loan or other agreement of Consus Real Estate if other liabilities of Consus Real Estate have not been paid, are accelerated). In the case of contracts that provide for termination- or redemption rights, the other party to the contract could exercise its rights following the Consus Real Estate Acquisition. To the extent Consus Real Estate terminates financing agreements or such financing agreements must be repaid otherwise, we could decide to refinance any of the existing financing agreements of Consus Real Estate. In case of the termination of existing financings due to a change of control of Consus Real Estate, the Company has entered into the Bridge Facility Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that we will be in a position to refinance financing agreements beyond the amount available to us under the Bridge Facility. Additionally, in that case, we may not be in a position to refinance our own business and the conditions of a refinancing by the Company could be negatively affected.

These regulations are frequently implemented retro-actively, thereby also impacting previously built real estate properties. There can be no assurance that all building codes or environmental regulations were, or are, complied with for all of Consus Group’s real estate properties. In the future, Consus Real Estate may acquire real estate properties that are, at the time of the acquisition, not in compliance with building codes or environmental regulations which remain undiscovered during the acquisition process. There can be no assurance that landlord responsibilities relating to environmental regulations, including, among others, environmental protection and energy efficiency, will not be amended or tightened in the future. Adapting to future regulations could require implementing extensive modernization measures which, in turn, may require the grant of building permits to be issued by relevant building authorities. There can be no assurance that such permits will be issued ----- promptly, or at all. Subsequently, we may not comply with the applicable building codes or environmental regulations and ultimately be in violation thereof. Furthermore, the lack of building permits (Baugenehmigungen) or incomplete documentation thereof could have adverse consequences under German law. Any lack of permits may partially or completely entitle the authorities to prohibit the use of the real estate property to the extent that such use is not covered by the required permit (“Formal Illegality”). In addition, building permits frequently set forth certain requirements, for example, in relation to the statics or the structural stability of a building. In the event that we fail to comply with such requirements, the constructed building would not be compliant with its building permit and therefore subject to Formal Illegality. To the extent that the status and the use of the property is not in line with currently applicable laws (“Material Illegality”), any missing permits may not be granted. In the event of Material Illegality, there is no protection from the limitation of the use of the property and a partial or complete demolition of the existing real estate property may be ordered by the respective authorities. In the case of Formal Illegality and/or Material Illegality, sole discretion rests with the relevant authorities to decide to what extent to intervene, if at all. However, even if the authorities do not intervene, the existence of any of these circumstances may have an adverse effect on Consus Real Estate’s ability to sell a non-compliant development project or commercial real estate property. In addition, some of the Consus Group’s real estate properties are subject to public easements (Baulasten) or easements in the land register (Dienstbarkeiten) for the benefit of other real estate properties or persons. Public easements and easements in the land register may affect the extent of structural use of a property, e.g., individual areas may not be built on or the extent of structural use may be limited with regard to inter alia permissible floor area, floor space index or basic area index. In addition, certain of the Consus Group’s development projects are located in urban planning zones (Gebiete des besonderen Städtebaurechts) which are issued by municipalities in order to remediate specific planning deficiencies or facilitate specific urban developments. The Federal Building Act (Baugesetzbuch) provides for different types of special urban planning zones, such as redevelopment areas (Sanierungsgebiete), conservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) or development areas (Entwicklungsgebiete). Existing properties located in areas, which are designated as special urban planning zones following the erection of such properties as well as properties which will be built in such urban planning zones may be subject to certain restrictions. Such restrictions include municipal pre-emptive rights or the requirement of a written permission of the municipality, for example, for rental agreements for a certain period of more than one year, property purchase agreements, the subdivision of a plot or the establishment, modification or revocation of a public easement. Additionally, it may be required to use the property in accordance with the aims and purposes of the respective planning zone. If one does not comply with such requirements, the municipality may initiate expropriation proceedings. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the redevelopment, the municipality may undertake infrastructure measures and may force the developer to compensate the respective municipality for any increase in the value of the properties resulting from such measures.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

According to German tax law, tax loss carryforwards are completely forfeited if more than 50% of the shares in an entity are transferred to an acquirer. An exception to this general rule relates to domestic taxable hidden reserves. To the extent such taxable hidden reserves are allocable to Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries (to be individually analyzed for each company) for tax purposes, no forfeiture of tax loss carryforwards should occur if the difference between the tax equity of Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries compared to the share purchase price based on the value of the Consus Real Estate and/or its subsidiaries includes sufficient hidden reserves. However, hidden reserves from participations in corporations held by the loss-making company are not taken into account in this respect. Accordingly, none or only some of the existing tax loss carryforwards may survive the acquisition and tax loss carryforwards may be fully or partially forfeited. Furthermore, the current German tax law that is applicable to tax loss carryforwards and their forfeiture is under dispute, and at least for the years 2008 to and including 2015 and for transfers of up to 50% of the shares of an entity, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) ruled that the applicable laws violate the German constitution and shall be amended with retroactive effect. Accordingly, the legislature has limited the application of section 8c para. 1 of the German Corporate Income Tax Act (Körperschaftssteuergesetz ) with ----- retroactive effect to cases where more than 50% of the shares are transferred to an acquirer.

The current expectation of an illustrative development FFO contribution from Consus Real Estate for 2020 is between €50 million and €80 million before run-rate operating and refinancing synergies of €90 million to €104 million. This target is based on the assumption of a total EBITDA of Consus Real Estate (prior to giving effect to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition) of €230 million, which is based on the assumptions that in the financial year 2020, Consus Real Estate generates (prior to giving effect to the Consus Real Estate Acquisition) (i) €150 million EBITDA for recent upfront sales, and (ii) €400 million EBITDA from forward sales (based on an assumed 20% margin on €2.0 billion of signed forward and condominium sales agreements), of which 70% will be distributed over the upcoming 3.5 years less assumed interest of approximately €130 million (annualized interest expense of €80 million adjusted for €11 million nonrecurring impact of derivatives and €34 million capitalized interest, plus estimated impact of reduced expensed interest post-closing of disposals) and less 30% taxes. However, there can be no assurance that the anticipated synergies from the Consus Real Estate Acquisition will be realized in full or at all or that the underlying assumptions made in connection with estimates are complete and/or accurate. Moreover, the costs incurred in connection with the realization of these synergies could be higher than currently estimated by the Company. Any incompleteness or inaccuracy in connection with the aforementioned assumptions or estimates could materially affect the expected synergies effects resulting from the Consus Real Estate Acquisition. The integration of the Consus Group into the ADLER Group, which is a multiyear process, could potentially not be consummated as intended and could result in expenses not anticipated at all or not adequately accounted for and the Company could potentially be legally bound to consummate the integration regardless of a materially adverse change of its economic rationale. The successful integration of the existing workforces, IT systems, corporate cultures and corporate structures and the introduction of joint processes are essential to the success of the integration of the Consus Group.

If the Market Interest Rate decreases, the price of a fixed interest rate note typically increases until the yield of such note is approximately equal to the Market Interest Rate.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2133,SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY,2133.13,Additional Non-IFRS Performance Measures,2133.13.1,,"We believe that the key performance indicators described in this section constitute the most important indicators for measuring the operating and financial performance of the ADLER Group’s business. However, the performance measures are not recognized as line items under IFRS and should not be considered as substitutes for figures on net assets, result before taxes, net earnings, cash flow from operating activities or other income statement, cash flow or balance sheet data, as determined in accordance with IFRS, or as indicators of profitability or liquidity. The performance measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for the ADLER Group’s cash requirements, nor whether any such measure is indicative of the ADLER Group’s historical operating results. The performance measures are not meant to be indicative of future results. Because not all companies calculate these performance measures in the same way, our presentation of the performance measures is not necessarily comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other companies. We expect the performance measures EBITDA from rental activities, EBITDA from rental activities margin, EBITDA total (including disposal results) (adjusted), EBITDA total (including disposal results) (adjusted) margin, FFO 1 (from rental activities), FFO 2 (including disposal result), AFFO (from rental activities), EPRA NAV and EPRA NRV to be of use for potential investors. We believe that the performance measures are useful in evaluating the ADLER Group’s operating performance, the net value of the ADLER Group’s property portfolio, the level of the ADLER Group’s indebtedness and of cash flow generated by the ADLER Group’s business, because a number of companies, in particular companies in the real estate business, also publish these figures as key performance indicators. With effect as from January 1, 2020, EPRA developed new ratios to reflect changes in the regulatory framework in Europe. As a result of these changes, EPRA NAV will be replaced by, among others, a ratio that highlights the value of net assets on a long-term basis, where assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallize in normal circumstances, such as the fair value of financial derivatives and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses are excluded and where, in an effort to reflect the value required to rebuild the company, related costs, including real estate transfer taxes, are included. We believe that a significant difference between EPRA NAV ----- and EPRA NRV involves the real estate transfer tax of the properties held. While real estate transfer tax was deducted for property valuation purposes under EPRA NAV, real estate transfer tax is included for property valuation purposes under EPRA NRV in an effort to reflect the low likeliness of property sales in the current market environment. For purposes of comparability, the ADLER Group intends to continue to report EPRA NAV for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. With effect as from June 30, 2020, the ADLER Group has adjusted its calculation method of the LTV-Ratio. As of June 30, 2019, December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company calculated the LTV-Ratio as the ratio of bonds, other loans and borrowings and other financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents to the fair value of properties (including investment properties and trading properties as well as advances paid in respect of investment properties and trading properties). As of June 30, 2020, the Company calculated the LTV-Ratio as the ratio of bonds, other loans and borrowings and other financial liabilities less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) selected financial assets, (iii) assets and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale, net, and (iv) deferred taxes related to liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale to the fair value of properties and investment in real estate companies. The reason for this adjustment in the calculation method is that due to the Business Combination and the consolidation of ADLER Real Estate AG into ADO Properties S.A. (renamed to ADLER Group S.A.), the newly formed ADLER Group had to merge two distinct accounting systems, including calculation methodologies. The Company believes that the current presentation results in reliable and more relevant information on the financial performance.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2134,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF NET ASSETS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2134.1,Overview,2134.1.1,,"We believe that we are a top-five residential real estate company in Germany based on gross asset value. Prior to the Business Combination, we focused on residential real estate located only in Berlin, Germany. After the Completion, we are focusing on becoming a leading integrated residential property group that is active throughout Germany. We create value by active portfolio and property management and opportunistic growth through strategic acquisitions, for which we have broadened our scope from Berlin-only to Germany-wide. We specialize in and focus on the purchase, management and development of income-generating multi-family residential real estate. The portfolio value of the ADLER Group as of June 30, 2020 was approximately €8.9 billion. As of June 30, 2020, the ADLER Group’s property portfolio consisted of 72,380 residential units with a total lettable area of 4,440,581 sqm, 2,302 commercial units (retail, office and other commercial) with a total lettable area of 268,938 sqm, 17,482 parking spaces and spaces for storage, antennas, etc. As of June 30, 2020, the ADLER Group’s vacancy rate was 5.6% and 7.8% for its residential units and commercial units, respectively. The average monthly net rent per sqm was €6.20 and €9.09 for its residential units and commercial units, respectively. Our business activities are influenced by numerous demographic, economic and political factors. Given our involvement in the real estate sector, we are affected by developments affecting and related to the residential property market in Germany, in particular macro-economic indicators such as population growth, economic growth, employment, purchasing power and the consumer price index. Furthermore, we are significantly affected by trends in micro-economic indicators, such as the future development of housing prices, rent levels, vacancy rates and home ownership rates. As a result, we compete with a number of privately and communally owned residential real estate companies. Berlin remains an important real estate market for us following the Business Combination. We believe that the residential real estate market in Berlin benefits notably from positive demographic trends. Berlin is the most populous city in Germany and had 3.64 million inhabitants in December 2018. It is expected that the number of inhabitants in Berlin will increase to 3.83 million by 2030 (source: Federal Statistical Office–Projected _Population Figures). We also believe that we will continue to benefit from Berlin’s status as the capital and_ largest city of Germany, which has one of Europe’s strongest economies and is an important center for economy, business, politics and culture in continental Europe. In addition to a growing number of governmental employees in the city, Berlin is a particularly dynamic economic center for, among others, the services, pharmaceuticals, media, creative and technology sectors. In order to keep up with the fast demographic growth, on the one hand, and to ease the strained situation on the housing market, on the other hand, a total of 194,000 new residential units would have to be built between now and the year 2030 according to the Berlin senate department for urban development and housing (source: _Berlin _Senate Department for Urban Development and Housing–Press Release)._ Our business model currently focuses on asset and property management, portfolio and facility management and identifying residential properties throughout Germany that present opportunities for us to create value by increasing rents, decreasing vacancy and privatizing condominiums. Market rents as well as the official rent index (“Mietspiegel”) have been constantly increasing in Germany over the recent years. The average growth _per annum in market rents has been higher in Berlin than for other major German cities (source: JLL–Housing Market Report Germany). Despite the recent increases in rent levels, rents in Berlin are still relatively low_ compared to the other big cities in Germany (source: JLL–Housing Market Report Germany), thereby presenting opportunities for our business and future growth. Our residential units face strong demand from broad segments of the population: from the growing youth population to individuals with low and medium household income, some of which are being supported by social benefits and transfer payments from public authorities. We believe that our residential units provide tenants with an attractive value proposition and are suitable to market demand, which is further enhanced by our active approach to capital expenditure for refurbishment. In addition, we seek to add value through the use of our efficient, fully integrated in-house management and tenant service platform to manage our portfolios. We believe that due to our history and particularly through our operational efforts since our establishment in 2006, we have achieved significant recognition in the market and as evidenced by our long-standing track record in achieving strong rental growth (see “Competitive _Strengths”)._ ----- During the 6M 2020, the ADLER Group generated income from rental activities of €147,897 thousand (6M 2019: €71,361 thousand; Fiscal Year 2019: €141,572 thousand; Fiscal Year 2018: €134,588 thousand; Fiscal Year 2017: €109,181 thousand) and EBITDA from rental activities of €77,302 thousand (6M 2019: €47,857 thousand; Fiscal Year 2019: €91,997 thousand; Fiscal Year 2018: €93,777 thousand; Fiscal Year 2017: €77,090 thousand).

On December 15, 2019, the Company entered into various share purchase agreements with minority shareholders of Consus Real Estate to acquire a 22.18% stake in Consus Real Estate, which, as a result of the completion of the ADLER Offer increased to a shareholding of 25.75%, and entered into the SCA with Consus Real Estate to engage in a strategic partnership and, to the extent legally permissible, work together to fully investigate and potentially undertake mutually beneficial property developments, including the acquisitions of land plots for new-builds. Through the Strategic Cooperation, the Company is receiving access to an experienced development platform focused on the Top 9 Cities in Germany, thereby securing a value-creating growth path for the future. On March 25, 2020, the Company announced its decision to make a voluntary public takeover offer to all shareholders of WESTGRUND, for the acquisition of all ordinary bearer shares of WESTGRUND against payment of a cash consideration. On April 17, 2020, the Company announced its decision to, simultaneously with the takeover offer, combine the takeover offer with a delisting offer to delist the WESTGRUND shares from the regulated market (Regulierter Markt) of the Düsseldorf Stock Exchange (Börse Düsseldorf). On May 6, 2020, the Company published the voluntary public takeover offer and delisting tender offer, pursuant to which it offered a cash consideration of €11.74 per WESTGRUND share. On June 25, 2020, in the publication required pursuant to Section 23 para. 1 sentence 1 no. 2 of the German Takeover and Acquisition Act, the Company announced that 1.36% of WESTGRUND shareholders have tendered their shares into the Company’s voluntary public takeover offer and delisting tender offer. As a result, the Company held 78,178,448 shares in WESTGRUND (corresponding to 98.24% of the share capital and voting rights in WESTGRUND). Therefore, pursuant to section 39c of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Übernahmegesetz – WpÜG), the minority shareholders in WESTGRUND had the right to demand that the_ Company acquire their respective shares in WESTGRUND within a further tender period from June 23, 2020 ----- to September 22, 2020. As a result, 5,799 further shares in WESTGRUND were tendered and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company directly and indirectly holds 78,184,247 shares in WESTGRUND, corresponding to 98.25% of the share capital and the voting rights in WESTGRUND. On June 29, 2020, the Company, by way of a resolution of a delegate authorized by the Board of Directors, exercised the call option under the Call/Put-Option Agreement (the “Consus Real Estate Call Option",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2134,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF NET ASSETS; FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2134.6,Exercise”). The Consus Call Option Exercise occurred by transfer of newly issued shares in the Company and,2134.6.1,,"transfer of the Company’s treasury shares previously indirectly held by ADLER Real Estate. Under the Call/Put-Option Agreement, the Company has undertaken to make a voluntary tender offer in the form of an exchange offer to acquire the remaining shares of Consus Real Estate (save for any applicable RETTBlocker). Accordingly, the Company may make an offer to all shareholders of Consus Real Estate to purchase their shares in Consus Real Estate by way of a voluntary public exchange offer (the “Consus Offer”), subject to market conditions. The Consus Offer would be based on an exchange ratio, adjusted for the issue of 30,819,391 newly issued shares in dematerialized form with no nominal value in connection with a capital increase against contribution in cash with subscription rights for existing shareholders of the Company and gross proceeds in an amount of €457 million, which was settled on July 24, 2020 (the “Rights Issue”), of one share in Consus Real Estate for 0.272 newly issued shares in the Company as consideration. Gröner Group GmbH has irrevocably undertaken to accept the Consus Offer in relation to a shareholding of 15.3% in Consus Real Estate. Alternatively, the Company may seek to amend the Call/Put-Option Agreement and enter into a share purchase agreement regarding Gröner Group GmbH’s shareholding of 20.5% in Consus Real Estate in lieu of Gröner Group GmbH accepting the Consus Offer, whereby the Company would acquire all shares held by Gröner Group GmbH in Consus Real Estate against transfer of newly issued shares in the Company as consideration. The new shares would be created by way of a capital increase without subscription rights against contribution in kind.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Cyclical economic developments beyond our control, including changes in growth and unemployment rates, price trends and interest rate levels, affect rental income levels, the potential for privatizations and for property sales, opportunities for acquisitions and purchase prices. For example, economic growth and favorable market conditions in the periods under review contributed to higher rents. After years of steady growth there have been increasing signs of a slowdown in the German economy with a decrease in gross domestic product (“GDP”) of 0.1% for the second quarter of 2019 (compared to 2018) while price-adjusted exports were down 0.8%, resulting in the largest decline recorded in the last six years (source: Federal _Statistical Office press release no. 321). The German economy returned to growth in the third quarter of 2019_ with an increase in GDP of 1.0% (compared to the same quarter in 2018) (source: Federal Statistical Office _press release no. 448). A decrease in GDP in Germany or an increase in unemployment could adversely affect_ the population’s purchasing power, and therefore its propensity to acquire residential real estate. Berlin’s real GDP grew by 3.1% in 2018 which is higher than any other German federal state. Per capita GDP in Berlin stood at €40,568 in 2018 compared to €38,864 in 2017, a nominal increase of 4.4% and a price-adjusted increase of 2.3% (source: Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung der Länder). This is slightly lower than the average German per capita GDP of €40,851 as of 2018. Disposable per capita income increased by 4.1% from an average of €19,538 in 2016 to €20,330 in 2017 (latest available, _source: Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung der Länder). The estimated per capita purchasing power in Berlin for 2019 is €21,689 which is lower than the German average of €23,779 but an increase of 3.1% compared to 2018 (source: GfK—Purchasing Power Germany). Since 2015, the average gross wages and ----- salaries in Berlin are above the German average. In 2018, they amounted to €36,146, an increase by 4.2% compared to 2017. In addition, rising interest rates can adversely affect the valuation of our investment properties, which may require us to recognize a valuation impairment charge that would negatively affect our income and balance sheet. In addition, inflation-driven or deflation-driven price increases or decreases affect our expenses. To the extent possible by law and taking into account the market environment, cost increases are compensated for by rent increases and/or allocated to ancillary costs. However, our focus on the affordable segment of the rental market in Berlin may mitigate the impact such developments may have on the Company. Political and regulatory decisions and developments such as, for example, public subsidies for residential space also influence supply and demand in the residential property market and affect price trends for rented residential units and sales of residential units. Furthermore, an increase in the new construction of residential units can increase the vacancy in our portfolio and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, in October 2019, the Berlin senate of the governing coalition proposed an edict to freeze rents of existing and new leases of existing residential apartments (except for subsidized or newly constructed apartments) in Berlin for five years. The bill was passed by Berlin’s parliament (Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus) on January 30, 2020 and entered into force on February 23, 2020. An adoption of a law that includes rent caps or similar measures could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flows (including FFO 1) and financial condition. Demographic factors such as changes in average household size, home ownership rate and migration patterns also affect the rental yields and market values of properties in our residential portfolio. For example, the number of households in Berlin stood at 2.028 million in 2018 compared to 2.003 million in 2017, an increase of 1.2% which is higher than the population growth in the same year (source: Federal Statistical Office— _Privathaushalte Bundesländer). Based on this, Berlin represents the largest residential rental market in_ Germany. The average number of persons per household amounted to 1.8. Of the private households in Berlin 53% were one person households compared to the German average of 42%.

In particular, we monitor closely the recently resolved bill to freeze rents of existing and new leases of existing residential apartments in Berlin for five years. We endeavor to improve our residential units, particularly through refurbishments, which increase the economic value of residential units and allow us to increase rents and more easily rent our units. We achieved average in-place rents per square meter per month for our residential units of €6.42, €6.73 and €7.39 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and, as a result of the Completion, €6.03 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Tenant turnover contributes to the number of vacant units due to the fact that time may elapse before a newly vacated unit can be re-let. Although high vacancy rates adversely affect our rental business, we may be able to sell vacant units in individual sales at a premium. Therefore, we decide from time to time to keep certain units designated for privatization vacant. We have implemented measures to reduce vacancy rates and the time it takes to conclude new leases with respect to vacated units and we will continue our efforts in this regard.

For additional information, see above “Risk Factors – Risks related to the ADLER Group’s Financial Situation _Our level of debt, the terms of current and future borrowings, and the hedging transactions we have entered _into, or will enter into in the future, could significantly constrain our operations and could make it more difficult or expensive to obtain new sources of financing without breaching financial covenants.”._",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Changes in interest rates cause variations in interest income and costs on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. Loans obtained at variable rates which are not hedged expose us to cash flow interest risk, which could have adverse effects on our profit or loss and financial position. Interest rates impact capitalization and discount rates, which in turn influence the fair value of our investment portfolio and our assets classified as held for sale. Moreover, lower interest rates in Germany tend to increase demand for residential properties, resulting in higher prices to be paid for acquired properties and also tend to positively impact the sale of properties. Conversely, rising interest rates lead to less favorable financing terms and negatively impact the sale of properties and thus tend to impact capitalization and discount rates. In addition, changes in interest rates impact our cost of financing. They affect the conditions at which we may obtain fixed rate financing and impact interest payment obligations under our floating rate debt obligations. Most of our interest rates (based on the value weighted interest rates on the liabilities due to financial institutions as of June 30, 2020) are either fixed or hedged, limiting our risk from increasing interest reference rates in the future. We have engaged in, and currently expect to continue to engage in, hedging transactions to reduce the risk of interest rate fluctuations. We fulfill the requirements of the IAS 39 hedge accounting rules applicable to accounting for hedging instruments (interest rate swaps) in hedging against cash flow risks from variable interest rate loans. When interest rate levels fluctuate, the fair value of the interest rate swaps also fluctuates.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

We value investment property initially at cost at the time of acquisition, including capitalized borrowing costs. After acquisition, we measure investment property at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of our investment properties as of June 30, 2020 were based on the valuation as of December 31, 2019 undertaken by CBRE and up-to-date experience regarding the location and category of the properties, and the fair values for our investment properties as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were based on valuations undertaken by CBRE. The valuations are based on a discounted cash flow model. The valuation model considers the present value of net cash flows to be generated from the property, taking into account expected rental growth rate, void periods, occupancy rate, lease incentive costs such as rentfree periods and other costs not paid by tenants. The expected net cash flows are discounted using risk-adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs. secondary), tenant credit quality and lease terms. As of June 30, 2020, the ADLER Group’s portfolio also included 16,063 parking spaces and 1,419 other units. We lease some of our investment property under commercial tenancy or lease agreements. The commercial tenancy or lease agreements usually run for more than seven years.

IFRS 16 introduced a single, on-balance sheet accounting model for lessees. As a result, the ADLER Group, as lessee, has recognized right-of-use assets representing its rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments. We elected to apply the standard using the modified retrospective approach, with an adjustment to the balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 and without a restatement of comparative data. In respect of all the leases, we elected to apply the transitional provisions such that on the date of initial application it recognized a liability at the present value of the balance of future lease payments discounted at its incremental borrowing rate at that date calculated according to the average duration of the remaining lease period as from the date of initial application, and concurrently recognized a right-of-use asset at the same amount of the liability, adjusted for any pre-paid or accrued lease payments that were recognized as an asset or liability before the date of initial application. Therefore, application of IFRS 16 did not have an effect on our equity at the date of initial application. As part of the initial application of IFRS 16, we have chosen to apply the following expedients: - Applying the practical expedient regarding the recognition and measurement of leases where the underlying asset has a low value; and - Applying the practical expedient regarding the recognition and measurement of short-term leases, for both leases that end within twelve months from the date of initial application and leases for a period of up to twelve months from the date of their inception for all groups of underlying assets to which the right-of-use relates. On the inception date of the lease, we determine whether the arrangement is a lease or contains a lease, while examining if it conveys the right to control the use of identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. In our assessment of whether an arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, we assess whether we have the following two rights throughout the lease term: (1) The right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the identified asset; and (2) The right to direct the identified asset’s use. For lease contracts that contain non-lease components, such as services or maintenance that are related to a lease component, we elected to account for the contract as a single lease component without separating the components. As a result of applying IFRS 16, in relation to leases that were previously classified as operating leases, we recognized €1,553 thousand of right-of-use assets and a €1,553 thousand lease liability as of January 1, 2019. As of June 30, 2020, the balance of right-of-use assets amounted to €6,049 thousand, non-current lease liabilities of €20,216 thousand and current lease liabilities of €3,147 thousand. Also in relation to those leases under IFRS 16, we recognized depreciation and interest costs instead of operating lease expense. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized €739 thousand of depreciation changes and €531 thousand interest costs from these leases. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we recognized €1,102 thousand of depreciation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Investors should also read the section “Certain Information with Regard to the Offering— _Forward-looking Statements” of this Offering Memorandum._ The calculation of the FFO 1 for the purpose of the FFO 1 Guidance 2020 was based on the calculation methodology and reconciliation used by the Company to calculate the FFO 1. The FFO 1 is an industry standard performance indicator for evaluating operational recurring profit of a real estate firm. The FFO 1 is derived from the EBITDA from rental activities for the respective periods adjusted to generally reflect net cash interest and current income taxes, see “Selected Consolidated Financial Information _of the Company—Additional Non-IFRS Performance Measures”._ The FFO 1 Guidance 2020 is based on the following assumptions made by the Board of Directors. These assumptions relate to factors (i) outside of the Company’s influence, (ii) that can be influenced by the Company to a limited extent or (iii) that can be influenced by the Company. Even though the Company considered these assumptions as appropriate when preparing the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, they may prove in retrospect to be inappropriate or unfounded in the future. If one or more of these assumptions should prove to be inappropriate or unfounded, the actual FFO 1 can deviate materially from the FFO 1 Guidance 2020. The FFO 1 Guidance 2020 reflects any effects from the takeover of ADLER Real Estate AG, which has been fully consolidated into ADO Properties S.A. (renamed to ADLER Group S.A.) as of April 9, 2020, including certain synergies which are expected to already be realized in 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

The main factors and related assumptions are described below: ----- Factor: Legislative and regulatory conditions On June 18, 2019, Berlin’s municipal government (Berliner Senat) announced its intention to freeze rents in Berlin for the next five years (“Mietendeckel”). On January 30, 2020, the Berlin parliament (Berliner _Abgeordnetenhaus) passed the Law on Rent Limitation in Housing in Berlin (Gesetz zur Mietenbegrenzung im Wohnungswesen in Berlin – MietenWoG Bln). The law entered into force on February 23, 2020. See “Regulatory Environment—Current Developments in German Tenancy Law—Rent Freeze (“Mietendeckel”)”. As a result,_ while preparing its FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed a €1 million decrease in its net rental income in the financial year ending December 31, 2020. On March 25, 2020, the German federal government passed a Law on mitigation of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic in Civil and Insolvency and Criminal Procedure Law (Gesetz zur Abmilderung der Folgen der _COVID-19-Pandemie im Zivil-, Insolvenz- und Strafverfahrensrecht) (the “COVID-Act”). Pursuant to the_ COVID-Act, landlords may not terminate residential and commercial lease agreements if the tenant fails to pay rent during the period of April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, provided that such non-payment is caused by impacts related to the Coronavirus. Payments that become due during the period of April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, but that were not settled, will have to ultimately be settled by June 30, 2022. In light of current uncertainty in relation to the impact of the Coronavirus, the Company has not assumed any material impact to FFO 1 as a result of this law. The Company has otherwise assumed that there will be no or only insignificant changes in the current and legal framework. Factor: Demographic developments in the residential real estate industry For purposes of the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed that the demographic developments in the German residential real estate market, and in Berlin in particular, remain unchanged. See “Berlin _Macroeconomic Situation, Demographic Drivers and Residential Real Estate Market”._ Factor: Changes in interest rates While preparing the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed that the current interest rates will remain stable, with the Company’s financing strategy and financing structure remaining largely unchanged. As the Company has secured a significant portion of its floating rate liabilities with interest rate hedges, the Company does not expect any significant negative short-term effects on its financial expenses. Factor: Cost inflation For the purposes of the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company did not assume any significant cost inflation in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. Factor: Unforeseeable events such as “force majeure” While preparing the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed that no significant unforeseeable events will occur that could lead to significant constraints in the ongoing business operations of the Company or its subsidiaries, for instance force majeure (e.g. fire, flooding, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes or terrorist attacks), strikes, extraordinary macroeconomic events or war. The Coronavirus has resulted in a deterioration of the political, socio-economic and financial situation in Germany. With the Coronavirus expanding rapidly, the negative impact on the Company’s business cannot be adequately determined or reliably quantified at this time and has therefore not been taken into account when preparing the FFO 1 Guidance 2020. In particular, the potential impact of Coronavirus on tenants’ ability to pay rent and the Company’s finance costs has not been considered. _Factors that can be influenced by the Company to a limited extent_ Likewise, other factors that can be influenced by the Company to a limited extent affect the FFO 1 Guidance 2020. The relevant assumptions are described below: ----- Factor: Net rental income For the purposes of the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed that the net rental income for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 will be between €280 million and €300 million. Net rental income of the Company in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 will therefore increase by approximately €146 million to €166 million compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the Business Combination. Net rental income has been adjusted to take into account the full-year effect of the Gewobag Sale (as defined below), resulting in an expected €27 million decrease in net rental income, as well as an expected €1 million decrease due to the new legislation in Berlin as mentioned above. The Company has assumed no rental growth at the ADLER Group level for 2020. In addition, net rental income has been adjusted to include expected lettings of its development project “Riverside” which has been completed at the end of 2019, less the effect from commercial asset disposals which occurred throughout 2019 and will continue in 2020 resulting in a decrease of net rental income. The Company has also assumed rental growth based on the current market environment. Factor: Cost of operations Costs of operations comprises salaries and related expenses, property operations and maintenance costs, costs of utilities recharged net and cost of sales of housing units. For the purposes of the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed that the cost of operations in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 will increase relative to its net rental income compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the Business Combination. The Company has assumed that the increase in costs of operations will be partly offset due to the realization of certain operational synergies, which the Company expects to already occur in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. The relation of the costs of operations to the net rental income assumed is based on historical experience and may deviate considerably from the budget assumptions owing to events such as unplanned increases of the vacancy rate or major unscheduled maintenance work. Factor: General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses comprises primarily salaries and related expenses, professional services, office, communication and IT expenses, advertising and marketing expenses, impairment loss on trade receivables, director fee and rent fees. For the purposes of the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed that, relative to the net rental income, general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, will increase compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the Business Combination. The Company has assumed that the increase in general and administrative expenses will be partly offset due to the realization of certain operational synergies, which the Company expects to already occur in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. Factor: Finance costs Finance costs comprises interest on bank loans and loans from related parties, interest on bonds, change in fair value of derivatives and other finance expenses. For the purposes of the FFO 1 Guidance 2020, the Company has assumed: - the refinancing of certain debt with amounts available under the Bridge Facility; - a €450 million rights issue will be completed in 2020, the proceeds of which will be partially used to refinance debt; - the total amount of debt of €4.8 billion based on the expected amount of debt as of December 31, 2020; - the average costs of the Company’s overall debt of 2.0%; - all of the terms and conditions of its financing contracts, especially financial covenants, will be met; - the interest rate risk will remain low in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, also due to interest rate hedges (interest rate swaps) concluded by the Company; ----- - the liquidity risk will remain low as the Company has assumed that sufficient liquidity is available and that the current level of the average financing costs of existing loan agreements can be reached even if new loan agreements are concluded or existing loan agreements are extended; - the net loan-to-value ratio of the property portfolio as a whole will increase to approximately 47% (excluding convertible bonds) due to the Business Combination; and - the Company has been put on credit watch negative and may be downgraded, which, however will not have an immediate impact on its financings and therefore has not been taken into account. Factor: Current income tax expenses The Company expects corporation income tax rates to remain stable and does not expect the tax laws concerning the Company to change in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. The Company expects the current income taxes for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 to amount to approximately €5 million. _Factors that can be influenced by the Company_ Factor: Timing of disposals The FFO 1 Guidance 2020 has been adjusted downward for certain commercial disposals at ADLER Real Estate, which occurred throughout 2019 and will continue in 2020. The date of such further disposals is not in full control of the Company. A delay in such transactions can have an impact on the FFO 1 Guidance 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

As the FFO 1 Guidance 2020 relates to a period not yet completed and is prepared on the basis of assumptions about future uncertain events and actions, it naturally entails substantial uncertainties.

In accordance with the Merger Agreement, LI Lorgen Ltd. was merged into ADOG as the absorbing entity. As a consequence of the Merger, LI Lorgen Ltd. ceased to exist and ADOG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADLER Real Estate on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with certain provisions of Israeli companies law. In accordance with a condition for the closing of the Merger, which occurred on December 10, 2019, ADOG sold 4.91% of its share capital and voting rights in the Company, thus effectively reducing its stake in the Company to 33.25%. On December 15, 2019, the Company announced its intention to make a voluntary public takeover offer for all shares of ADLER Real Estate in the form of an exchange offer and, by entering into a business combination agreement, to combine the businesses of the ADLER Real Estate Group and the ADLER Group. The Company offered 0.4164 shares in the Company for every one share in ADLER Real Estate. The offer period commenced on February 7, 2020 and expired on March 25, 2020. 91.93% of the shareholders of ADLER Real Estate accepted the offer. On December 15, 2019, the Company also announced its intention to implement a €500 million rights issue to existing shareholders and new investors following the completion of the Business Combination, which was subsequently reduced to €450 million following a resolution of the Board of Directors to recommend to the shareholders of the Company to not distribute any dividend for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Moreover, on December 15, 2019, the Company entered into various share purchase agreements with minority shareholders to acquire 22.18% of the shares in Consus Real Estate, which, as a result of the successful completion of the Business Combination, increased to a shareholding of 25.75%. Furthermore, the Company entered into a call/put-option agreement, as amended (the “Call/Put-Option Agreement”) with Aggregate Holdings S.A. for its 69,619,173 shares in Consus Group, whereby the consideration for one share in Consus Real Estate is 0.2390 newly issued shares in the Company, adjusted to any dividends paid and equity raise done by the Company or Consus Real Estate. On June 29, 2020, the Company resolved to exercise the call option under the Call/Put-Option Agreement. On July 6, 2020, the call option exercise was fully settled with a conversion ratio, adjusted for the Rights Offering, of one share in Consus Real Estate for 0.272 newly issued shares in the Company. Under the Call/Put-Option Agreement, the Company has undertaken to make a voluntary tender offer in the form of an exchange offer to acquire the remaining shares of Consus Real Estate (save for any applicable RETT-Blocker). Accordingly, the Company may make an offer to all shareholders of Consus Real Estate to purchase their shares in Consus Real Estate by way of a voluntary public exchange offer (the “Consus Offer”), subject to market conditions. The Consus Offer would be based on an exchange ratio, adjusted for the issue of 30,819,391 newly issued shares in dematerialized form with no nominal value in connection with a capital increase against contribution in cash with subscription rights for existing shareholders of the Company and gross proceeds in an amount of €457 million, which was settled on July 24, 2020 (the “Rights Issue”), of one share in Consus Real Estate for 0.272 newly issued shares in the Company as consideration.

The _Pro Forma_ Consolidated Financial Information is not meaningful on a stand-alone basis.

Accordingly, all acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as any non-controlling interest in ADLER Real Estate and Consus Real Estate were recognized in the Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet. ----- The _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not include deferred tax effects as a result of accounting policy adjustments or _Pro Forma Adjustments resulting from (i) the Merger, (ii) the Business Combination and Rights Offering and (iii) the Acquisition. Income tax effects are only considered for _Pro _Forma Adjustments, if a material impact on the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information was identified_ and explicitly stated. In addition, the _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information does not include any adjustment to deferred tax assets for tax loss carry forwards that could potentially be lost if shares are transferred and certain thresholds are exceeded. Furthermore, no fair value adjustments with regard to contractual termination clauses (e.g. for financial liabilities) or contractual termination clauses as such, which could be triggered in the context of a change of control were taken into account. The effects of the Merger on any of the covenants of contracts in place with ADLER Real Estate and/or Consus Real Estate and/or ADOG and any third party (e.g. for financial liabilities) could not be conclusively assessed for purposes of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. No effects of the conversion of stock options were taken into account for purposes of these _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. To reflect the Company’s assumed shareholding in ADLER Real Estate and Consus Real Estate, the Company’s share capital as of June 30, 2020 was taken into account when preparing the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. The same principle was applied with regard to the positions “treasury shares”, “share premium” and “reserves”. Any goodwill (negative goodwill) recognized in the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information considers goodwill (negative goodwill) attributable to owners of the company only (accounting policy choice for partial goodwill method under IFRS 3.19). The non-controlling interests are, therefore, measured at fair value of the net assets. Hence, the net assets and liabilities identified for purposes of the preliminary purchase price allocation based solely on the ADLER Interim Financials 2020, the Consus Interim Financials 2020, and the ADOP Interim Financials 2020 will potentially deviate from the net assets and liabilities that would be determined in the final purchase price allocation. In the ADLER Financials 2019 and the ADLER Interim Financials 2020, the income from charged operating costs are recorded according to the principal method, in particular due to the Company’s business model, which provides for a high share of in-house services. ADLER Real Estate differentiated these services according to whether the company is a principal or an agent. Services, which ADLER Real Estate provides as an agent are recognized as net costs. Other services are recognized as gross costs, because ADLER Real Estate provides these services as a principal. Consus Real Estate also recognizes service charges passed on to tenants as revenue. Therefore, the reporting of expenses related to operating costs and the corresponding income from additional charges to the tenant provided as an agent was not offset in accordance with IFRS 15 in the _Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the ADLER Financials 2019 and the ADLER Interim Financials 2020 as well as in the Consus Financials 2019 and the Consus Interim Financials 2020. In the ADOP Financials 2019 and the ADOP Interim Financials 2020, the income from charged operating costs for utilities are recorded according to the agent method of the Company, services like cleaning, gardening and maintenance service are recorded according to the principal method. Therefore, the reporting of expenses related to operating costs and the corresponding income from additional charges to the tenant provided as a principal was offset in accordance with IFRS 15 in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the ADOP Financials 2019 and the ADOP Interim Financials 2020. Both methods are in accordance with IFRS and do not represent an accounting policy choice, therefore, no presentation adjustment were recorded in the _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information. For purposes of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information regarding the alignment of the ADLER Financials 2019, the ADLER Interim Financials 2020, the Consus Financials 2019 and the Consus Interim Financials 2020 with the Company’s accounting policies in relation to the recognition of income and expenses, no different treatment of operating costs was taken into account and in turn no alignment was considered. Due to the Acquisition, a new business model is included in the Company for which no accounting policy was in place. For purposes of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the accounting policy of Consus Real Estate is being applied. Consus Real Estate recognizes contract assets and contract liabilities as separate line items. Therefore, separate line items for contract assets and contract liabilities were implemented in the Pro _Forma Consolidated Financial Information. Depending on the timing of revenue and payments received, the_ revenue recognition results either in contract assets or contract liabilities. In Consus Real Estate’s development ----- activities, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual term, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition resulting in contract assets. However, from time to time, Consus Real Estate receives advances from its customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities. These assets and liabilities are reported on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Accordingly, these amounts (€4,694 thousand) were re-classified from other intangible assets to intangible assets. (ii) Investments accounted using equity method Consus Real Estate does not separately disclose investments in associated companies as a separate line item. Therefore, the investments accounted for using the equity method (€20,725 thousand) were re-classified as investments in associated companies. ----- (iii) Financial assets / contract assets Consus Real Estate discloses financial assets amounting to €161,932 thousand. The non-current financial assets amounting to €101,227 thousand were split up into non-current other financial assets (€57,741 thousand) and non-current restricted bank deposits (€43,486 thousand).

In total (€108.593 thousand) were re-classified to other receivables. Other assets (€195 thousand) were re-classified to other financial assets. (vii) Subscribed capital Consus Real Estate does not disclose share capital as a separate line item. Hence, these amounts (€161,322 thousand) were re-classified from subscribed capital to share capital. (viii) Capital reserves The Company does not separately disclose a share premium.

Therefore both, the non-current financing liabilities (€1,439,549 thousand) and the current financing liabilities (€1,280,932 thousand) are re-classified as noncurrent other loans and borrowings (€1,439,549 thousand) and current loans and borrowings (€1,280,932 thousand). (xi) Other liabilities Consus Real Estate discloses other liabilities amounting to €185,519 thousand in total.

Therefore, the _Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for the period from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 was adjusted to include interest expense calculated with an average effective interest rate of 3.03% p.a. to the outstanding balance (€620,000 thousand) in the amount of €9,378 thousand in finance costs. For purposes of the _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, no outflow of cash is shown.

The issue price of the 2025 Bond was 98.871%. The Company paid transaction costs in an amount of €4,400 thousand. Therefore, the Company received net proceeds in the amount of €391,084 thousand from the 2025 Bond. Part of these net proceeds were made available for the repayment of a portion of the bridge loan facility in the amount of €265,000 thousand (see note 6). The remaining part will be used for the repayment of short-term maturities. For purposes of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, it is assumed that the 2025 Bond was issued prior to January 1, 2019. Therefore, in the Pro Forma Consolidated Statement, the 2025 Bond is recognized as a corporate bond in an amount of €391,084 thousand. The cash inflow was reduced by the repayment of the bridge loan facility and is therefore recognized as cash and cash equivalents in an amount of €113,084 thousand and the bridge facility loan was reduced by €265,000 thousand in the other loans and borrowings.

The provisional purchase price for 100% of the shares in Holsten Quartier is €320 million on a cash-free debt-free basis. The Company made a down-payment of €50,000 thousand reflected in advances paid. According to IFRS 3, the loan and the payment in advance are not considered part of the business combination, as both transactions were not settled as part of the Acquisition. The loan and the advance payment are treated as pre-existing relationship between Consus Real Estate and the Company. The paid consideration should be increased by the amount of the pre-existing relationship (see note 13). For purposes of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, this pre-existing relationship is adjusted in the Pro Forma Balance Sheet. Therefore, the investment in Consus Real Estate is increased by the amount of €100,900 thousand and the other financial assets are reduced in the corresponding amount.

For purposes of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the purchase price allocation of Consus Real Estate was undertaken on the basis of a provisional valuation of the acquired net assets. The consideration for 64.95% of Consus Real Estate Shares is calculated based on the ADLER Group S.A. closing share price as of July 2, 2020 (€24.18 per share) totaling €595,400 thousand. ADLER Group S.A. already held an investment of 21.79% in Consus Real Estate prior to the acquisition and a further 43.15% was acquired as part of the successive acquisition. As a result, the investment in Consus Real Estate in the amount of €703,195 thousand was derecognized by adjusting investment in financial instrument in the same amount. The financial investments include other financial instruments in addition to the Consus Real Estate investment. These financial instruments are reclassified in the amount of €6,497 thousand to other financial assets. Due to the purchase price allocation as of July 2, 2020, the fair value of the investments deviates from the booked investment in the Company. Therefore, the investment and finance cost are adjusted in the amount of € 351 thousand. For purposes of the _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, the CG Divestment SPA and Ajos Divestment SPA (refer to note 14) were taken into account in the provisional purchase price allocation. Thus, no fair value adjustments were recorded on assets or liabilities that are subject to both SPA, and the assets and liabilities disposed of were excluded when determining net assets acquired. The provisional purchase price allocation results in a fair value adjustment of corporate bonds in the amount of €9,500 thousand, convertible bonds in the amount of €12,800 thousand, other loans and borrowings of €27,900 thousand, other payables in the amount of €50,000 thousand and other financial assets in the amount of €13,600 thousand.

Additionally, fair value adjustments were made to investment properties in the amount of €17,700 thousand and trading properties in the amount of €277,100 thousand.

The issue price of the 2025 Bond was 98.871%. The Company paid transaction costs in an amount of €4,400 thousand. Therefore, the Company received net proceeds in the amount of €391,084 thousand. Part of these net proceeds was made available for the repayment of a portion of the bridge loan facility in the amount of €265,000 thousand (see note 6). The remaining part will be used for the repayment of short-term maturities. For purposes of the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information, it is assumed that the 2025 Bond was issued prior to January 1, 2019. Therefore, the 2025 Bond is recognized in the _Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements as a corporate bond in an amount of €391,084 thousand. The cash inflow was reduced by the repayment of the bridge loan facility and is therefore recognized as cash and cash equivalents in an amount of €113,084 thousand and the bridge facility loan was reduced by €265,000 thousand in the other loans and borrowings.

Moreover, Consus Real Estate’s landbank allows for accretive growth of the NAV over the next six to eight years up to an illustrative run-rate NAV of €7.3 billion to €7.9 billion.

We ----- expect this to be contributed before the run-rate operating and refinancing synergies of €90 million to €104 million that we aim to achieve in 2021. We aim to achieve cumulative financing synergies of €50 million to €54 million in 2020 and €77 million to €86 million by the end of 2021 for the ADLER Group by way of significant debt reduction and, thus, interest savings. Thus, we expect to realize total cumulative synergies of €63 million to €72 million by the end of 2020 and €90 million to €104 million by the end of 2021 with a corresponding positive effect on our pre-tax FFO.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

The Consus Group focuses on the development of residential units in the Top 9 Cities, which it primarily sells to institutional purchasers, including pension funds and insurance companies, by entering into forward sale agreements, which refer to the sale on a turn-key basis of properties still to be built at the expense of the seller. Additionally, it sells condominiums to retail purchasers by entering into purchase agreements providing for staggered payments, which become due when certain development milestones are reached. It also develops commercial and retail spaces to complement its project developments, primarily as part of mixed-use developments. With the SSN Group AG (renamed to Consus Swiss Finance AG) acquisition in December 2018, and in combination with organic growth, the Consus Group significantly increased its targeted sales volume of its development projects from €6.2 billion of gross development value (“GDV”) as of December 31, 2017 to €8.0 billion of GDV as of June 30, 2020 and strategically streamlined its development projects portfolio from 53 to 39 as of the same date.

The total purchase price under the Ajos Divestment SPA, which the parties have agreed to not disclose, is subject to certain adjustments between the period of July 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020, including on the basis of an earn-out provision. _Material Financing Agreements of the Consus Group_ Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes On May 3, 2019 and October 17, 2019, Consus Real Estate issued senior secured notes in an aggregate principal amount of €450,000,000 bearing a fixed annual interest at a rate of 9.625% and maturing on May 15, 2024 (the “Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes”). The Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes are admitted to trading on The International Stock Exchange. Subject to certain conditions and against payment of certain premiums, Consus Real Estate may redeem the Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes prior to its maturity. The Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes are secured by first-ranking pledges over shares in certain companies of the Consus Group as well as an assignment of intra-group receivables of the Consus Group, claims under a certain intra-group loan and claims of Consus Real Estate under the Acquisition Agreement. In connection therewith, Consus Real Estate entered into a security trust agreement for the benefit of the bondholders of the Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the bondholders of the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds (see also “Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds”). Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, Consus Real Estate may be required to ----- make an offer to repurchase all of the Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Consus Real Estate shall not be required to make such an offer upon a change of control if a third party makes the offer in compliance with the requirements applicable to an offer made by Consus Real Estate and purchases all Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes validly tendered. The settlement of the Consus Real Estate Call Option Exercise triggered a change of control under the Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes. On July 17, 2020, Consus Real Estate published an announcement that, as a result of its change of control offer to purchase for cash any outstanding Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes, no notes were validly tendered by the noteholders and, therefore, have been or will be accepted for repurchase. As of June 30, 2020, €450.0 million remained outstanding under the Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes. Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds On November 29, 2017, Consus Real Estate issued convertible bonds in the aggregate principal amount of €200,000,000 due 2022 (the “Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds”). The Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds bear a fixed annual interest at a rate of 4.0%. Consus Real Estate entered into a security trust agreement for the benefit of the bondholders of the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds and the bondholders of the Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes (see also “Consus 2024 Senior Secured Notes”). Bondholders have the right to convert the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds into shares of Consus Real Estate at an initial conversion price of €9.1885, which has, with effect as of July 24, 2018, been adjusted to a conversion price of €9.1706, subject to certain adjustments under certain circumstances. Consus Real Estate may redeem all of the bonds outstanding under the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds if the share price of Consus Real Estate on at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days exceeds 130% of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day. In case of a change of control, each bondholder may terminate all or part of the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds and Consus Real Estate is obliged to redeem them at their principal amount plus accrued interest. If Consus Real Estate gives notice of a voluntary tender offer for its shares to the bondholders, each bondholder may convert the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds held by it by giving a conversion notice that is conditional upon reaching the relevant acceptance threshold as set forth in the tender offer. In such case, the conversion price will be subject to an adjustment. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Consus 2022 Convertible Bond, its holders have the right to offer to Consus Real Estate to participate in a capital increase by way of contribution in kind (Sacheinlage) by offering bonds held by it as contribution in kind, whereas it is in Consus Real Estate’s discretion to accept such offer. If Consus Real Estate accepts such offer, the new shares would be derived from Consus Real Estate’s conditional capital. However, under the terms and conditions of the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds provide that, upon exercise of the conversion right by a bondholder, Consus Real Estate may (in its sole discretion) elect to pay a cash alternative amount instead of delivering shares. The exercise of the included termination right leads to a 100% repayment plus accrued interest. The settlement of the Consus Real Estate Call Option Exercise triggered a change of control under the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds. Therefore, holders of the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds had the right to terminate all or part of their Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds that had not previously been converted or redeemed and require Consus Real Estate to redeem the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds at the principal amount plus accrued interest thereon. Bondholders in the aggregate principal amount of €54,100,000 exercised this right. As of June 30, 2020, €173.7 million remained outstanding under the Consus 2022 Convertible Bonds. Financing of the Consus Group’s development projects and other financing arrangements The Consus Group’s project-related financing agreements in an aggregate amount of €2,720 million as of June 30, 2020 consisted of loan agreements with financing banks, promissory note loan (Schuldscheindarlehen), other bonds (Anleihen) and loan agreements with individuals and non-bank entities or financings not immediately related to the Consus Group’s development projects. The Consus Group will use the proceeds from the Consus May 2020 Divestments to, among others, reduce its project debt by approximately €865 million, including a €350 million reduction of high-cost mezzanine debt. On a pro forma basis, the Consus May 2020 Divestments will decrease the Consus Group’s average cost of debt to 7.4% and reduce its net debt by over €1,005 million. The majority of the Consus Group’s financing arrangements were entered into in connection with the financing of the acquisition or development of land plots and/or real estate properties and are in line with customary ----- market practice. Typically, such project financings have a short to mid-term maturity profile to match Consus Real Estate’s general forward sale approach and the value creation process. In the ordinary course of business, the Consus Group continues to finance, refinance and extend its project financings on a rolling basis. In certain cases, such refinancing or extension only occurs following the maturity of the relevant financing. Individual project financings may mature prior to the relevant developments being completed and sold and, in such cases, such financings are refinanced or extended as required. In line with industry practice, the process required for such refinancing or extension is initiated shortly (i.e. usually three months) prior to maturity. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Additionally, demand and supply on the real estate market are also influenced by socio-demographic factors, the overall demographic development, changes in consumer behavior and ways of life or preferred forms of living. This may have repercussions on the average living space per capita, the average number of people living in household, preferred forms of living such as apartments or single family-houses or the preferred locations like cities, conurbations or rural areas. Furthermore, the Company believes that a decisive factor regarding the attractiveness of a property is the physical condition of the building and, in case of condominiums, the tenant structure. Over the recent years, the German residential real estate market has benefitted and is expected to further benefit from a relatively positive macroeconomic environment on the basis of _e.g. the following trends and developments: _GDP Growth (in %)_ After years of steady growth there have been increasing signs of a slowdown in the German economy with a GDP decrease of 0.1% for the second quarter of 2019 (compared to 2018) while price-adjusted exports were down 0.8%, resulting in the largest decline recorded in the last six years (source: Federal Statistical Office– _Press Release 321). The German economy returned to growth in the third quarter and fourth quarters of 2019_ with an increase in GDP of 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively (compared to the same quarters in 2018) (source: _Federal Statistical Office–Press Release 056).

The number of persons in insurable employment in February 2020 was 0.5% (214,000 persons) higher than in February 2019 (source: Federal Statistical Office–Press Release 115). _Employment (in million people)_ 46.0 45.0 44.0 43.0 42.0 41.0 40.0 45.3 44.9 43.1 42.7 42.3 44.2 43.5 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 _(source: Federal Statistical Office–Genesis data base) Unemployment rate in Germany (in %)_ The unemployment rate in Germany continuously declined in the last five years, reaching 4.6% in 2015, 4.1% in 2016, 3.8% in 2017, 3.4% in 2018 and 3.2% in 2019.

In April 2020, the consumer price index is expected to show an increase of 0.8% to April 2019 (source: Federal Statistical Office–Press Release 149). On an annual average, consumer prices in Germany rose by 1.4% in 2019 after 1.8% in 2018, 1.5% in 2017 and 0.5% in 2016 (source: _Federal Statistical Office–Consumer Prices). Population Growth to Continue_ According to the Federal Statistical Office, 83.2 million people were living in Germany at the end of 2019. At the end of 2018, the figure was 83.0 million. Since the last census survey in 2011 on the country’s population and the employment and housing conditions carried out by the statistical offices of the Federation and States (Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder), the population has been growing steadily, while it had declined slightly between 2002 and 2010. Despite the birth deficit, the number of inhabitants in Germany increased again due to a migration surplus and, at the end of 2019, is expected to have reached a new record high since German reunification (source: Federal Statistical Office–Press Release 029; Federal Statistical Office–Press Release _244, Federal Statistical Office–Press Release 022).

Increase in the Number of Households_ The number of households in Germany reached almost 41.4 million in 2018, increasing from 41.3 million in the previous year. This, too, is the highest number recorded in Germany over the last 25 years, rising from 36.2 million in 1993 (source: Federal Statistical Office–Privathaushalte Deutschland). _Number of households (in million)_ 42.0 41.5 41.0 40.5 40.0 39.5 39.0 38.5 41.0 40.8 41.3 41.4 39.9 39.7 40.2 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (source: Federal Statistical Office–Privathaushalte Deutschland) As the increase in the number of household was much stronger than the increase in the overall population, it follows that the average household size has declined over time. In particular, the number of single person households has increased significantly from 35.4% in 1996 to 41.9% in 2018 (source: Federal Statistical Office– _Privathaushalte Deutschland). The number of households is expected to continue to grow reaching 42.6 million_ by 2040 (source: Federal Statistical Office–Entwicklung der Privathaushalte bis 2040). The Company believes that stable and solid growth, high employment, low inflation, a growing population and the continuing trend to single households are positive indicators for further growth in demand for residential space. _Urban Population and Immigration Trends_ The recent increase in the German population has been driven by immigration, both labor market oriented and as a result of an influx of refugees, and has resulted in an accelerated increase of population density in Germany’s key metropolitan regions, leading to continued urbanization (source: Statista–Germany: _Urbanization from 2009 to 2019)._ The following chart indicates that the urbanization trend is expected to continue in the future and emphasizes that the proportion of population living in urban areas in Germany is expected to increase from approximately 77% in 2015 to approximately 80% in 2035, with a long term forecast of 84% in 2050 (source: United Nations– _World Urbanization Prospects).

On June 1, 2015, a law on rent control of new leases (Mietpreisbremse) was enacted, enabling the federal states to establish individual decrees and limiting rent increases upon re-letting of existing residential units in regions with low supply only allows an increase of rent up to local rental table level plus 10%. Furthermore, the provisions of landlord-tenant law are especially relevant to the Company. German residential landlord-tenant law (Wohnraummietrecht) is considered to be tenant friendly in many respects, restricting the ability to increase rents. If the parties to a tenancy agreement have not agreed on a stepped rent or an indexation – both unusual in the German residential market – a rent increase is feasible only within certain limits and taking into account statutory limits, for example, as a result of the so-called rent control (so-called “Mietpreisbremse”) which was enacted in 2015 and has been implemented by various German federal states. Further obligations for landlords are stipulated in the Tenancy Law Adjustment Act (Mietrechtsanpassungsgesetz) which is in effect since January 1, 2019 and pursuant to which allocation of modernization costs shall be reduced from 11% to 8% of the investment amount (applicable to all housing markets) with absolute caps of rent growth following a modernization. ----- In addition, in light of the housing shortages in certain German cities and regions, where the free market results in high and unaffordable rents, not only for low income but also for middle income households, recent discussions at the state level, in particular in Berlin, have advocated for a freeze of rent levels (so-called “Mietpreisdeckel”), which was enacted on February 23, 2020, and the implementation of administrative approvals for rent increases permitted following modernization measures which significantly affect a landlord’s ability to increase rents. Moreover, on September 12, 2019, the state of Berlin introduced a motion in the German Federal Council (Bundesrat) to abolish the possibility of allocating property tax from landlords to tenants (Mieter-Grundsteuer_Entlastungsgesetz). It is currently unclear whether the motion will be accepted and which federal states will join Berlin’s initiative in the Federal Council (Bundesrat). Despite a transitional period which shall apply to tenancies which arose before this Act came into effect, a disallocation of property tax would likely have – at least – a short-term impact on the Company’s performance as such costs would need to be borne by the Company unless such costs could be compensated by higher tenant rates which may be difficult to realize.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

As rents were also subsidized for decades, private ownership in home ownership was discouraged. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Only 2.7 million units, equaling approximately 10% of the total housing stock units, are owned by private housing companies. The rest is owned by private landlords, cooperatives, public housing associations, municipalities or other public real estate companies of the public sector. The 25 largest owners include nine private companies which demonstrates the fragmented and regionally diverse ownership structure of the rental apartment market in Germany. However, seven of these private companies are among the ten largest apartment owners. The two largest apartment owners by far in Germany are Vonovia SE, with around 416,000 apartments (source: Vonovia), and Deutsche Wohnen SE, which owns around 164,000 units (source: Deutsche Wohnen). Both are listed companies and operate throughout Germany. The regional focus of the Vonovia SE portfolio, which covers 653 towns and cities, is on Berlin, Dresden and North Rhine-Westphalia. In the case of Deutsche Wohnen SE, around 72% of apartments owned are in Berlin. Based upon the census data, Vonovia SE and Deutsche Wohnen SE own approximately 10% of all rental apartments in Berlin combined (source: Savills–Ownership in the Residential Market). As such, competition is highly fragmented and varies from location to location. The Company believes that there are no market-dominating competitors in asset management. As a consequence, the ADLER Group faces various partly small-scale private and partly mid-sized municipal competitors in every location where it is present. The Company also believes that there is negligible brand awareness among potential tenants who tend to look for affordable yet well maintained accommodation in certain locations and not strictly for apartments owned by a particular company. Naturally, competition is fiercer in locations that suffer from negative immigration balances as potential tenants have options to choose from and suppliers of residential units exert additional efforts to maintain the marketability of their apartments. The opposite is true in locations with increasing population numbers. There is also competition with respect to the acquisition of suitable portfolios. As in the residential market, competition among potential bidders varies profoundly in regard to the portfolio size, the quality of the real estate offered or the regional diversification of the portfolio. The Company believes that in respect of potential portfolio acquisitions its competitors are primarily other medium and large real estate companies and institutional investors, such as insurance companies as well as investment funds investing in real estate. Other important competitors in the residential property portfolios market are local authorities selling or buying back housing stock, as well as so-called “property splitters” who buy residential housing stock for the purpose of its development, segmentation and sale or privatization. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Prior to the Business Combination, we focused on residential real estate located only in Berlin, Germany. After the Completion, we are focusing on becoming a leading integrated residential property group that is active throughout Germany. We create value by active portfolio and property management and opportunistic growth through strategic acquisitions, for which we have broadened our scope from Berlin-only to Germany-wide. We specialize in and focus on the purchase, management and development of income-generating multi-family residential real estate. The portfolio value of the ADLER Group as of June 30, 2020 was approximately €8.9 billion. As of June 30, 2020, the ADLER Group’s property portfolio consisted of 72,380 residential units with a total lettable area of 4,440,581 sqm, 2,302 commercial units (retail, office and other commercial) with a total lettable area of 268,938 sqm, 16,063 parking spaces and spaces for storage, antennas, etc. As of June 30, 2020, the ADLER Group’s vacancy rate was 5.6% and 7.8% for its residential units and commercial units, respectively. The average monthly net rent per sqm was €6.03 and €9.09 for its residential units and commercial units, respectively. Our business activities are influenced by numerous demographic, economic and political factors. Given our involvement in the real estate sector, we are affected by developments affecting and related to the residential property market in Germany, in particular macro-economic indicators such as population growth, economic growth, employment, purchasing power and the consumer price index. Furthermore, we are significantly affected by trends in micro-economic indicators, such as the future development of housing prices, rent levels, vacancy rates and home ownership rates. As a result, we compete with a number of privately and communally owned residential real estate companies. Berlin remains an important real estate market for us following the Business Combination. We believe that the residential real estate market in Berlin benefits notably from positive demographic trends. Berlin is the most populous city in Germany and had 3.64 million inhabitants in December 2018. It is expected that the number of inhabitants in Berlin will increase to 3.83 million by 2030 (source: Federal Statistical Office–Projected _Population Figures). We also believe that we will continue to benefit from Berlin’s status as the capital and_ largest city of Germany, which has one of Europe’s strongest economies and is an important center for economy, business, politics and culture in continental Europe. In addition to a growing number of governmental employees in the city, Berlin is a particularly dynamic economic center for, among others, the services, pharmaceuticals, media, creative and technology sectors. In order to keep up with the fast demographic growth, on the one hand, and to ease the strained situation on the housing market, on the other hand, a total of 194,000 new residential units would have to be built between now and the year 2030 according to the Berlin senate department for urban development and housing (source: _Berlin _Senate Department for Urban Development and Housing–Press Release)._ Our business model currently focuses on asset and property management, portfolio and facility management and identifying residential properties throughout Germany that present opportunities for us to create value by increasing rents, decreasing vacancy and privatizing condominiums. Market rents as well as the official rent index (“Mietspiegel”) have been constantly increasing in Germany over the recent years. The average growth _per annum in market rents has been higher in Berlin than for other major German cities (source: JLL–Housing Market Report Germany). Despite the recent increases in rent levels, rents in Berlin are still relatively low_ compared to the other big cities in Germany (source: JLL–Housing Market Report Germany), thereby presenting opportunities for our business and future growth. Our residential units face strong demand from broad segments of the population: from the growing youth population to individuals with low and medium household income, some of which are being supported by social benefits and transfer payments from public authorities. We believe that our residential units provide tenants with an attractive value proposition and are suitable to market demand, which is further enhanced by our active approach to capital expenditure for refurbishment. In addition, we seek to add value through the use of our efficient, fully integrated in-house management and tenant service platform to manage our portfolios. We believe that due to our history and particularly through our operational efforts since our establishment in 2006, we have achieved significant recognition in the market ----- and as evidenced by our long-standing track record in achieving strong rental growth (see “Competitive _Strengths”)._ During the 6M 2020, the ADLER Group generated income from rental activities of €147,897 thousand (6M 2019: €71,361 thousand; Fiscal Year 2019: €141,572 thousand; Fiscal Year 2018: €134,588 thousand; Fiscal Year 2017: €109,181 thousand) and **EBITDA from rental activities** of €77,302 thousand (6M 2019: €47,857 thousand; Fiscal Year 2019: €91,997 thousand; Fiscal Year 2018: €93,777 thousand; Fiscal Year 2017: €77,090 thousand). **EBITDA total (including disposal results) (adjusted) for the 6M 2020 was €82,538 thousand (6M 2019: €48,923 thousand; Fiscal Year 2019: €93,806 thousand; Fiscal Year 2018: €96,255 thousand; Fiscal Year 2017: €80,018 thousand).

Through the Strategic Cooperation, the Company is receiving access to an experienced development platform focused on the Top 9 Cities in Germany, thereby securing a value-creating growth path for the future. On March 25, 2020, the Company announced its decision to make a voluntary public takeover offer to all shareholders of WESTGRUND, for the acquisition of all ordinary bearer shares of WESTGRUND against payment of a cash consideration. On April 17, 2020, the Company announced its decision to, simultaneously with the takeover offer, combine the takeover offer with a delisting offer to delist the WESTGRUND shares from the regulated market (Regulierter Markt) of the Düsseldorf Stock Exchange (Börse Düsseldorf). On May 6, 2020, the Company published the voluntary public takeover offer and delisting tender offer, pursuant to which it offered a cash consideration of €11.74 per WESTGRUND share. On June 25, 2020, in the publication required pursuant to Section 23 para. 1 sentence 1 no. 2 of the German Takeover and Acquisition Act, the Company announced that 1.36% of WESTGRUND shareholders have tendered their shares into the Company’s voluntary ----- public takeover offer and delisting tender offer. As a result, the Company held 78,178,448 shares in WESTGRUND (corresponding to 98.24% of the share capital and voting rights in WESTGRUND). Therefore, pursuant to section 39c of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs-und _Übernahmegesetz – WpÜG), the minority shareholders in WESTGRUND had the right to demand that the_ Company acquire their respective shares in WESTGRUND within a further tender period from June 23, 2020 to September 22, 2020. As a result, 5,799 further shares in WESTGRUND were tendered and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Company directly and indirectly holds 78,184,247 shares in WESTGRUND, corresponding to 98.25% of the share capital and the voting rights in WESTGRUND. On June 29, 2020, the Company, by way of a resolution of a delegate authorized by the Board of Directors, exercised the call option under the Call/Put-Option Agreement. The Consus Real Estate Call Option Exercise occurred by transfer of newly issued shares in the Company and transfer of the Company’s treasury shares previously indirectly held by ADLER Real Estate. Under the Call/Put-Option Agreement, the Company has undertaken to make the Consus Offer, subject to market conditions. The Consus Offer would be based on an exchange ratio, adjusted for the Rights Issue, of one share in Consus Real Estate for 0.272 newly issued shares in the Company as consideration. Gröner Group GmbH has irrevocably undertaken to accept the Consus Offer in relation to a shareholding of 15.3% in Consus Real Estate. Alternatively, the Company may seek to amend the Call/Put-Option Agreement and enter into a share purchase agreement regarding Gröner Group GmbH’s shareholding of 20.5% in Consus Real Estate in lieu of Gröner Group GmbH accepting the Consus Offer, whereby the Company would acquire all shares held by Gröner Group GmbH in Consus Real Estate against transfer of newly issued shares in the Company as consideration.

Our strategy to realize upside potential includes the following approaches. We pursue regular rent increases up to the market levels (i) within the regulatory and legal limits as well as (ii) through tenant fluctuation without capex investment. In addition, we continuously review rent increase potentials and pursue growth beyond the rent table through capex investments to modernize, refurbish and/or re-position (by improving the prior asset management) our properties allowing for higher rent levels. Therefore, our capex investments are targeted at markets with the potential for such rent increases. Lastly, we reduce portfolio vacancy by active marketing with an approach tailored to the respective micro-location.

An average unit consists of one or two rooms. We had leased 94.4% of our residential units and 92.2% of our commercial units and generated an average monthly net rent of €6.03 per sqm for our residential units and €9.09 per sqm for our commercial units. As of June 30, 2020, vacancy rates for our residential units and commercial units were 5.5% and 7.8%, respectively. The ADLER Group’s business activities focus on the Northern, Eastern and Western parts of Germany, where the ADLER Group holds most of its properties. As of June 30, 2020, the geographic distribution of the ADLER Group’s property portfolio was as follows: Berlin: 19,098 units (49% of GAV), Lower-Saxony: 17,958 (16% of GAV), North Rhine Westphalia: 13,700 units (13% of GAV), Saxony: 9,561 units (9%) with the remainder located in various other federal states. With the acquisition of BCP in 2018, the ADLER Group has acquired, according to its own assessment, assets in attractive locations, partly in inner cities (“A-locations”) such as Leipzig, Dortmund and Hanover with approximately 12,000 residential units. Nevertheless, its portfolio still predominantly consists of properties located on the outskirts of larger conurbations. This is particularly apparent in North Rhine-Westphalia, where virtually all of our properties are located in the Ruhr area, which remains Germany’s largest industrial region. In Lower Saxony, the property holdings are mainly located in Hanover, the Wolfsburg/Braunschweig/Helmstedt region, a traditionally strong region in economic terms, the Bremen catchment area and in Wilhelmshaven, a city which is benefiting from the deep-water port and the location of the German Navy’s largest base on the North Sea. In Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, the properties are predominantly located in the catchment areas of Halle, Leipzig, Chemnitz and Dresden – regions that after the German reunification initially lost their industry and part of their population however are now benefiting from growth in population once again as a consequence of the significant infrastructure investments carried out in these areas over the last 20 years. In our view, property holdings on the edges of conurbations are typically characterized by higher vacancy rates, but also generate higher rental yields than properties in central or “A-locations”. Peripheral locations benefit to a great extent from counter-urbanization. Rent increases in the tight rental markets in the city centers translate into a lower availability of affordable apartments. Due to price sensitive demand this leads to households moving out of the “A-locations” into surrounding areas. However, in order to achieve a stable portfolio mix, we also aim at having a certain portion of “A-locations” in our rental portfolio.

The ADLER Group’s fully integrated in-house and scalable platform for active asset management and privatizations is led by an experienced management team. Therefore, we manage our operating business in a way that enables us to make targeted investments, accretive add-on acquisitions and privatizations in various micro-locations. The following chart depicts an overview of our operating model: ----- Our four business functions are responsible for (i) asset and portfolio management, (ii) property and facility management, (iii) construction management, and (iv) acquisitions and financing. The teams within each business function collect and process district-specific knowledge related to the relevant task. The performance of each business function is reflected by the building performance that is monitored on the basis of key performance indicators set for each building. Our asset and portfolio management focuses mainly on the purchase and management of income-generating real estate. It is the coordination and financial arm of our business. Based on its knowledge of the different markets and the condition of the specific apartments, and taking into account current vacancy rates and refurbishment and modernization requirements, our asset and portfolio management team periodically updates the target rent for new lettings. Furthermore, asset and portfolio management provides various support services, including bookkeeping, human resources administration and information technology services for and within the ADLER Group. Our property and facility management provides property management and services to tenants, respectively. It specializes in value optimization through residential and commercial property management, providing services in property management, letting management, tenant bookkeeping, rent collection and controlling and reporting. A distinct in-sourced team and brand provides immediate response to all kinds of facility management issues, including cleaning, janitor services and gardening. Our distinct facility management team has led to cost savings and increased tenant satisfaction because we exercise full control over these services.

In addition, the potential for rent increases in the portfolio is assessed on an ongoing basis and implemented where appropriate. Leasing and management comprises active rental and receivable management as well as collecting outstanding receivables. To this end, we have developed a regional structure that allows for the management of all properties of the ADLER Group. We take a similar approach in relation to our facility management, i.e. for craftsmen and caretaker services. The majority of these activities are integrated into the ADLER Group. To this end, we have developed a regional structure very similar to our property management. ADLER Energie Service GmbH (“AES”) manages energyrelated activities in the ADLER Group. This includes the distribution of heat and energy as well as responsibility for all centralized heating systems within the ADLER Group. In the future, however, it is envisaged that AES will take over the management of all energy-related activities within the ADLER Group. As part of its portfolio optimization, the ADLER Group continually analyzes the opportunities for realizing potential for appreciation and rent increases by modernizing and renovating its portfolio properties. The modernization measures include all measures to improve the fixtures and fittings of the residential units, such as insulation work and the upgrading of outdated fixtures and fittings of the apartments. Renovation activities include all activities intended to fundamentally improve the building stock. In preparation for all modernization and larger renovation activities, the ADLER Group performs cost-benefit analyzes to determine whether the required investments can be recovered with a profit from the realizable appreciation. For modernization and renovation work, the ADLER Group exclusively commissions third-party contractors who provide high-quality services and offer a favorable price-performance ratio. Similarly, the ADLER Group analyzes all potentially developable parts in the portfolio, such as options to build on gaps between buildings, convert attics, expand residential units by adding balconies or terraces, or use unutilized plots on existing properties of the residential complexes for building additional residential units. During implementation, the ADLER Group limits its activities to coordinating and managing the construction work and modernization and renovation measures. In addition, the ADLER Group continuously monitors the operating costs of the portfolios so it can counteract potential increases in service charges. Although most of the service charges are passed on to the tenants, sharp increases in service charges could lead to a reduction in the scope for rent increases, because the tenants may in some circumstances not be able to absorb an increase in total costs. In order to maximize long-term profitability, the ADLER Group aims at complementing its existing Rental business with opportunistic acquisitions of single residential properties, residential property portfolios or real ----- estate holding companies. For this purpose, the ADLER Group relies on its network of contacts with potential sellers and sales organizations and initially assesses the location of the real estate, its state of development and traffic connections, as well as its integration into regions with steady or rising population numbers. The ADLER Group also observes the regional real estate markets and analyzes the opportunities to further expand its residential property portfolio by acquiring additional single properties or property portfolios. In any of these situations, the ADLER Group assesses the appreciation potential of the properties to implement the acquisition on a financially sustainable basis.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Through our asset management activity, we seek to manage our assets to grow FFO 1 (from rental activities) and cash flow resulting in increases of the value of our real estate portfolio. To achieve these goals, we focus on increasing rental income, reducing vacancy, reducing the costs and risks of operating our assets and maintaining a conservative capital structure. We consider our portfolio development efforts an important part of our strategy. To this end, we capitalize on major societal trends. The trends that we have identified are demographic trends such as the expected continued increase of one-to two-person households and the increase of population over the next ten years. Targeted sales of condominiums (privatizations) are part of our strategy to actively manage our portfolio. The prices achieved in our value-oriented privatizations significantly exceed the fair value based on multi-family rental blocks. Before September 2014, we purchased buildings that had already been converted into condominiums but we did not immediately begin selling those condominiums. We began the business practice of converting residential units into condominiums and selling them in September 2014 as our total portfolio became sizeable enough for privatizations to commence significant margin potential and attractive conditions presented themselves. As of June 30, 2020, we have 135 units that have been converted or are in the process of being converted into condominiums. We have identified 3,754 additional units in our properties which can be converted into condominiums over the medium term and another 2,169 units which can be converted long term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

We have initiated measures to make our letting process more efficient. Our letting department,"performs virtually all administrative work to support our letting agents, which allows them to focus on closing new letting contracts and letting strategies. Our letting specialists have a significant amount of discretion to freely address prospective tenant needs. We support our letting service activities with a wide range of marketing activities (such as signs and illumination of windows and banners) that are focused on an entire property, individual units or individual micro-locations as well as on specific tenant target groups delineated by life cycle or economic situation. In our marketing activities, we conduct a careful tenant screening process that includes tenant credit checks. Furthermore we perform an ongoing vacancy management. We survey units during the three-month cancellation period and if the technical condition of the unit is satisfactory, we immediately begin our marketing efforts to bring vacancy to a minimum by aiming to immediately rent the units with limited or no period of vacancy in between tenants. Our property and facility management works closely with our in-house construction management to receive recommendations on the scope of refurbishment needed in order to fulfill market needs and to rent out the vacant units successfully. ----- Rent Collection._** We strictly monitor overdue rent from our tenants. We established a structured arrears management process, which is managed by thirteen employees supported by a specialized external law firm, including specified dunning letters, outbound calls, email and on-site visits. Account managers may give tenants the option of a deferred payment or installment payments. To provide this service, we currently employ managers who can give tenants expert advice and who can negotiate individually tailored solutions in order to avoid costly eviction proceedings for all parties involved.

Rent development involves observation of market rents and the ability to increase rents on,"a regular basis for existing letting contracts. The rent revisions are primarily determined by the rent index (Mietspiegel), the restrictions of the German letting laws, the economic purchasing power of our tenants as well as restrictions due to subsidies. See “Regulatory Environment”. We seek to increase our income from rent through (i) closing the gap to market rents on existing tenancies within the regulatory limits, (ii) adapting rents to market levels as rent restrictions fall away and (iii) higher rents for new lease contracts in relation to rents of existing contracts and (iv) continuing growth in the longterm through opportunistic acquisitions of assets with visible operational upside potential. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we amended approximately 8,394 residential letting contracts resulting in a reduced annualized net rent of approximately €0.4 million (compared to 3,437 residential letting contracts amended in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, which resulted in an additional annualized net rent of approximately €0.68 million). In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we amended approximately 7,960 residential letting contracts resulting in an additional annualized net rent of approximately €1.2 million. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we amended approximately 7,630 residential letting contracts resulting in an additional annualized net rent of approximately €2.1 million. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we amended approximately 6,030 residential letting contracts resulting in an additional annualized net rent of approximately €1.5 million. Our tenant turnover rate based on our total portfolio (excluding the units sold under the Gewobag Sale) averaged 5.2% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 (compared to 5.3% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019), 7.7% per year for the year ended December 31, 2019, 7.1% per year for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and is a factor in increasing the value of our assets through unit turn refurbishment and modernization and results in rent increase opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

In addition we conduct periodic modernization of our properties, for example, the planned replacement of roofs or windows, modernizations of facades, refresh of staircases, etc. Such refurbishment is done according to an annual investment program. Through our standardized procedures and work volume we optimize our costs of construction. ----- We apply strict criteria when selecting investment opportunities and concentrate on investment opportunities that can be integrated into our asset and portfolio management and that will further improve rent out possibilities.

The entire investment process, from project selection to post-completion, is managed after asset and portfolio management, has reviewed and approved the capex application.

These proceedings are routine matters of tenancy and other laws, and do not have a significant impact on the ADLER Group’s business. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, other than the proceedings described herein, there are no and have not been within the last 12 months governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including pending or threatened proceedings) that could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and prospects. _Proceedings related to ADLER Real Estate’s capacity as an indirect shareholder of conwert Immobilien Invest SE_ In connection with ADLER Real Estate’s acquisition of MountainPeak Trading Limited, Nicosia/Cyprus (“MountainPeak”) (which held approximately 23% of the voting rights in conwert Immobilien Invest SE (“conwert”) at the time) in August 2015, the Austrian Takeover Commission (Übernahmekommission), in a ruling dated November 30, 2016 and upheld by a binding ruling of the Austrian Supreme Court (Oberster _Gerichtshof) dated March 1, 2017 and communicated to ADLER Real Estate on April 10, 2017, held that_ ADLER Real Estate, together with MountainPeak and certain other parties, all of whom acted in concert with respect to conwert, acquired a controlling stake in conwert on September 29, 2015 (the “Conwert Acquisition”) and, ultimately, wrongly failed to make a mandatory takeover offer to the remaining shareholders of conwert at that time. We are exposed to potential restitution proceedings in which shareholders and holders of convertible bonds issued by conwert may seek damages from us (among others), asserting that these shareholders sold shares or convertible notes at a price that was lower than the minimum offer price that the involved parties would have been obliged to pay to shareholders of conwert in the context of the wrongfully omitted takeover offer. Eight damage claims of former shareholders of conwert with a cumulative dispute amount of approximately €8.5 million are pending at the Vienna Commercial Court (Handelsgericht Wien) in connection with the Conwert Acquisition as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the first proceeding related to the aforementioned damage claim and following a ruling by the Vienna Commercial Court (Handelsgericht Wien) on April 18, 2019, the claim was ultimately dismissed by the Higher Regional Court Vienna (Oberlandesgericht _Wien) in a ruling dated November 25, 2019. As a part of the Conwert Acquisition, ADLER Real Estate issued_ mandatory convertible notes in an amount of €175 million at a conversion price of €16.50 per share, which was significantly above the market price of the ADLER Real Estate shares at that time. Depending on the valuation method applied, the purchase price for one conwert share at the time varied between approximately €13.50 and more than €15.00. The financial impact of any restitution claims and proceedings, including the aforementioned nine damage claims, is largely dependent on the share price that the Austrian Takeover Commission (Übernahmekommission) determines to be the minimum price that would have had to be paid under a mandatory takeover offer to shareholders of conwert. Due to a lack of factual basis as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we believe that, as of the same date, it is not in a position to give a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential financial impact but assumes that such assertions could result in restitution claims exceeding a total of €10 million. The limitation period for the assertion of any additional claims expired mid-June 2020. ----- In addition, we were and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, are involved in certain administrative penal proceedings in relation to the Conwert Acquisition, none of which, however, we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business.

BCP’s petitioning minority shareholder (who holds one share in BCP) asserts that certain of ADLER Real Estate’s agreements to purchase BCP shares, including by way of a put option agreement, violated applicable tender offer rules. The petitioner requests that the BCP shares acquired by ADLER Real Estate shall be declared dormant and, further, that the relevant class of shareholders shall be awarded certain monetary compensation and reimbursements (in an amount of approximately NIS 78 million to NIS 116 million). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no further shareholders of BCP have filed similar actions.

Morgan Europe Limited as agent entered into a bridge term loan facility agreement (the “Bridge Facility Agreement”) under which the Company may utilize a bridge term facility with an original maximum nominal amount of up to €2,424,000,000 (the “Bridge Facility”). Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. acceded to the Bridge Facility Agreement as additional lenders. The maximum nominal amount under the Bridge Facility was thereafter reduced to €1,085,470,000. As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, €620,267,229 are utilized under the Bridge Facility. The utilized funds under the Bridge Facility were used to refinance certain existing financial indebtedness, including bonds and loans, of ADLER Real Estate and its subsidiaries that were subject to change-of-control termination rights. If the Company acquires the majority of the shares in Consus Real Estate and certain conditions are met, the Company may utilize the remaining portion of the Bridge Facility with a nominal amount of up to €200,000,000 for the purpose of prepaying outstanding indebtedness of Consus Real Estate and its subsidiaries. _Maturity Dates_ Subject to the extension options for the Bridge Facility described below, the Bridge Facility will mature on March 15, 2021. The maturity of the Bridge Facility may be extended four times by six months per extension. Each such extension is subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions and is not subject to any finance party’s consent. _Interest and Fees_ The Bridge Facility bears interest at a rate _per annum equal to the aggregate of the respectively applicable EURIBOR, subject to a floor of zero, plus a margin. The applicable margin is subject to a margin ratchet which is dependent on both the Company’s credit rating provided by S&P and the time elapsed since the date of the Bridge Facility Agreement. ----- If the S&P rating for the Company’s long-term unsecured and non-credit enhanced debt obligations (for the avoidance of doubt, which may be better than the Company’s corporate credit rating) is BB+ or better, the margin will, until September 15, 2020, be 2.25% _per annum. On September 15, 2020 and thereafter each 3 months, the margin will be increased by 0.25% per annum. If the Company’s long-term unsecured and non-credit enhanced debt obligations are rated (a) BB, the applicable margin will be 0.75% per annum higher, (b) BB-, the applicable margin will be 1.50% per annum higher, and (c) B+ or lower or S&P does not provide such rating anymore, the applicable margin will be 2.75% per annum higher, in each case, than set out in the previous paragraph under the assumption that the S&P rating for the Company’s long-term unsecured and non-credit enhanced debt obligations is BB+ or better. All ratchet steps are subject to a margin flex increase of up to 0.50% per annum. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee in monthly arrears. The commitment fee will be computed at the rate of (a) 0% for the first two months after the date of the Bridge Facility Agreement, (b) 10% of the applicable margin during the 3[rd] month after the date of the Bridge Facility Agreement, (c) 20% of the applicable margin during the 4[th] month after the date of the Bridge Facility Agreement, and (d) 30% of the applicable margin as from the 5[th] month after the date of the Bridge Facility Agreement onwards.

Furthermore, the Company is, subject to certain conditions, entitled to replace or repay and cancel participations of an individual lender in any utilization(s) by giving five business days’ prior notice to the agent and such lender. In addition to any voluntary prepayments, the Bridge Facility Agreement requires mandatory prepayment in full or in part, and, if applicable, cancellation of the Bridge Facility in certain circumstances, including: (a) with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Bridge Facility or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any utilization under the Bridge Facility; (b) following the occurrence of a “change of control” in relation to the Borrower (as defined in the Bridge Facility Agreement), in relation to any lender that exercises its change-of-control termination right within 45 days after being notified of the relevant change of control; (c) from the net proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of bonds, the take-out of term loans or the issuance of equity instruments, including new shares in the Company, after the date of the Bridge Facility Agreement; and (d) from the net proceeds of the disposal of certain assets, undertakings or businesses, provided that the Bridge Facility Agreement contains certain carve-outs from and a €400,000,000 basket for such prepayment obligation. _Covenants_ The Bridge Facility Agreement requires the Company to comply with two financial covenants, whereby the Company must ensure that, as of each quarterly reporting date: (a) the ratio of “Total Net Debt” to “Total Assets” (in each case, as defined in the Bridge Facility Agreement) does not exceed 60%; and ----- (b) the Interest Cover Ratio (as defined in the Bridge Facility Agreement) is at least equal to (i) as long as the Company has not acquired the majority of the shares in Consus Real Estate, (a) 2.25 to 1.00 until December 31, 2020, (b) 2.35 to 1.00 from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, and (c) 2.45 to 1.00 thereafter, and (ii) after the Company acquired the majority of the shares in Consus Real Estate, 1.80 to 1.00 for the remaining term of the Bridge Facility Agreement. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, subsidiaries acquired after the date of the Bridge Facility Agreement) are subject to certain restrictive and, as the case may be, affirmative covenants under the Bridge Facilities Agreement customary for these types of financing which are subject to certain specified exceptions and/or qualifications (customized to its business and adjusted to the ADLER Group’s current credit standing). Additionally, the Company is required to provide certain financial information and other information regarding the Company’s and the ADLER Group’s financial condition to the lenders. _Events of default_ The Bridge Facility sets out certain events of default that are customary for this type of financing. The occurrence of any such event of default would, subject to applicable grace periods and/or rights to subsequent fulfilment and/or agreed exceptions, entitle the lenders to cancel their commitments, declare all or part of the loans (together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding under the Bridge Facility) to be immediately due and payable or payable on demand.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.1,Restrictions due to German Tenancy Law,1185.1.2,Statutory Limits on Rent Increases,"As set out in more detail below, the landlord is substantially restricted in terminating residential leases and thus may be bound by the leases for a long period of time. Against this background, German law allows the landlord to increase the rent of existing lease agreements under certain circumstances and to a legally defined extent. These are set out in this section, whereas recent statutory regulation to limit the landlord’s right to freely determine the rent for new leases (“Mietpreisbremse”) as well as to freeze and retroactively reduce rents (“Mietendeckel”) are set out below under “Current Developments in German Tenancy Law”. Generally, landlords and existing or new tenants can freely enter into bilateral agreements to establish and increase the amount of rent payable. The underlying freedom to contract in accordance with the wishes of the parties is only limited as follows: Section 5 of the German Economic Offenses Act (Wirtschaftsstrafgesetz) prohibits the willful or reckless letting of space for dwellings at rents or with ancillary costs that are unconscionably high. Such is the case if the rent or ancillary costs substantially exceed the comparative rent levels (ortsübliche Vergleichsmiete) within the past six years due to an abuse of the limited availability of comparable space (generally, a rent exceeding the comparative rent level by 20% is deemed to infringe this provision). In the prior legislative period, a draft bill was introduced into the German parliament that rents exceeding 20% of the prevailing comparative rent level in a municipality or a district of a municipality shall constitute an administrative offense (Ordnungswidrigkeit) without it being required that unreasonably high rent is “due to an abuse of the limited availability of comparable room”. The draft bill period has elapsed. The federal council (Bundesrat) presented a new draft bill including the before-mentioned changes on November 29, 2019, which was introduced into the German parliament on January 8, 2020. In addition, according to the new draft bill, it is intended to increase the fine (Bußgeld) for violations of the regulations from €50,000 to €100,000. Furthermore, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) has held that rents exceeding the comparative rent levels (ortsübliche Vergleichsmiete) by about 50% may constitute usury (Wucher) under Section 291 German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch). ----- With lease agreements that are not subject to public rent control and for which restrictions on rent increases have not been contractually agreed the landlord may assert a right of contractual increase of the rent, subject to statutory and contractual requirements, up to locally prevailing comparative rent levels (ortsübliche _Vergleichsmiete) if the rent has remained unchanged for the 15 months preceding the intended increase. As a_ rule, however, the rent cannot increase by more than 20% in three years (capping limit) according to the current legal framework. However, the governments of the German Federal States are empowered to adopt regulations to lower the capping limit to 15%, which has occurred in the federal state of Berlin due to which the capping limit has been lowered to 15% for all of Berlin with effect until May 10, 2023 pursuant to the Berlin regulation on cap limits (Kappungsgrenzen-Verordnung). Such provisions for capping limits have also been introduced in 12 other federal states. The determination of the comparative rent levels (ortsübliche Vergleichsmiete) is to some extent linked to respective local rent indexes (Mietspiegel). In connection with freely financed residential units and lease agreements that are not subject to contractual rent restrictions, the landlord may also increase the annual rent by not more than 8% of the costs incurred in modernizing of the respective rental space, subject to statutory and contractual requirements. However, our ability to increase rents following a modernization may also be restricted in cases the works carried out would be considered maintenance in line with the standards established for government subsidized apartment buildings (geförderte Wohnungsbaumaßnahmen), or in case of luxury refurbishments, i.e. modernizations that exceed a level an average owner would undertake as an investment in his property. Regarding current developments in this regard, please refer to the section “Current Developments in German Tenancy Law” below. Following the rent increases, tenants may have an extraordinary termination right. Please see also information regarding limitations on our ability to increase rents under “German laws protecting _residential tenants and existing restrictions on the rate of rental increases could make it more difficult to increase the rents of residential units we own.”_",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.1,Restrictions due to German Tenancy Law,1185.1.3,Owner’s Repair and Maintenance Obligations and Modernizations Measures,"Under German law, the landlord must, unless the parties agree otherwise, maintain and repair the property (this obligation extends to the structure, the façade, the roof of the building, but also the interior of the residential units). In general, the landlord is restricted in transferring this maintenance and repair obligation to the tenant in the standard lease agreements used. Subject to compliance with statutory limitations, the landlord may transfer the obligations to carry out decorative repairs (Schönheitsreparaturen) and the costs of minor repairs (Kleinreparaturen) for a residential unit’s interior to the tenant, however, the latter of which only under the condition that the costs are limited for each single case as well as with regard to the total sum of the minor repairs per year. If the landlord assigns such obligations within standardized contracts, the terms must comply with the strict requirements for standardized business terms. For example, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) has ruled that standard clauses in letting contracts are invalid if they obligate the tenant to carry out decorative repairs (Schönheitsreparaturen) within a fixed schedule or to fully renovate the apartment at the end of the letting term regardless of the premises’ condition (Endrenovierung). In addition, under standard clauses, the obligation to carry out decorative repairs may only be validly transferred to the tenant if the apartment was handed-over in a renovated condition or, when the apartment was handed-over in an unrenovated condition if an adequate compensation is offered to the tenant in exchange. The invalidity of such clauses results in the landlord being responsible for the repair and maintenance and being required to bear all related costs. If the tenant carries out such repair and maintenance works without actually being obliged to do so, the landlord might have to compensate the corresponding costs. This may increase the landlord’s maintenance costs for such properties. In general, tenants have to tolerate maintenance measures (Erhaltungsmaßnahmen) and modernization measures (Modernisierungsmaßnahmen), in particular energetic modernization measures that were announced by the landlord in writing three months prior to the beginning of the planned measures, unless such measures would constitute an unreasonable hardship for the tenant, family members or members of the household of the tenant. Following the announcement of modernization measures, tenants are entitled to a special termination right (Sonderkündigungsrecht). Regarding the possibility to allocate parts of the costs incurred to the tenant by way of a rent increase, see “Statutory Limits on Rent Increases”. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.1,Restrictions due to German Tenancy Law,1185.1.4,Statutory Protection of the Tenant Against Termination and Eviction,"Generally, unless there is good cause (wichtiger Grund) justifying an extraordinary termination, the landlord may only terminate a letting contract for residential space with notice (ordentlich) and only if he has a legitimate interest (berechtigtes Interesse) in ending the tenancy. By law, a legitimate interest in ending the tenancy may only arise if (i) the tenant commits a culpable and substantial contractual breach; (ii) the owner has a claim of personal use in the property (Eigenbedarf) for himself, his family members, or members of his household; or (iii) the owner would otherwise be prevented from reasonable economic utilization and would therefore suffer considerable detriment. “Reasonable economic utilization” as grounds for termination is intended to ensure the free economic disposability of property. Such grounds exist if the owner were to suffer considerable detriment from continuing the tenancy (for example, receiving a significantly lower purchase price; expenses significantly exceed income). However, the possibility of either realizing a higher rent by offering the residential space to another tenant or a landlord’s intention of selling the residential space in connection with the conversion of housing into individually owned residential units, for example, would not qualify. In fact, in case of conversion to condominiums, the BGB prohibits personal use and reasonable economic utilization as grounds for termination by the purchaser for three years after transfer of title if the residential space was already rented to a tenant before the conversion to individual ownership. In regions where housing supplies are deemed to be insufficient, the governments of the German Federal States may extend this period against termination to up to ten years by statutory order. Such statutory order has been passed for the Federal State of Berlin, in effect until September 30, 2023. Also other federal states (North-Rhine Westphalia, Hesse, Hamburg, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Lower Saxony) have made use of this option. A residential tenant may object to a termination by the landlord (not in case of a termination for good cause) and demand continuation of the lease, if the termination would mean a hardship to the tenant, his family members or members of his household that is not justifiable even considering the landlord’s legitimate interest (Sozialklausel). Pursuant to case law, such objection may be justified, for example, in case the tenant is old, pregnant, has a serious illness, or where there is no comparable accommodation available. Even if the landlord successfully terminates the letting contract on the basis of a legitimate interest, the tenant is protected under German tenancy law against immediate eviction. In consequence, a court may allow for an appropriate deadline (with a maximum delay of one year) for the tenant to vacate the apartment after the effective termination of the letting contract by the landlord. However, as alternative to the classic eviction procedure, the “Berliner Räumung”, offering the landlord the cost-effective opportunity to limit the eviction procedure to the procurement of possession, was implemented with the Tenancy Law Amendment Act (Mietrechtsänderungsgesetz). Furthermore, eviction procedures shall no longer be tediously delayed because of a right of possession of a third person that is not covered by the executory title (Vollstreckungstitel). A further title against such third person is now obtainable by way of an injunction (einstweiliger Rechtsschutz). On March 25, 2020, the German parliament passed a law to mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic in civil and insolvency laws as well as in criminal law proceedings (Gesetz zur Abmilderung der Folgen der _COVID-19-Pandemie im Zivil-, Insolvenz- und Strafverfahrensrecht) (the “COVID-Act”). Pursuant to the_ COVID-Act, landlords may not terminate residential and commercial lease agreements if the tenant fails to pay rent during the period of April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, provided that such non-payment is caused by impacts related to the Coronavirus. Therefore, the tenant must demonstrate that non-payment is caused by impacts related to the Coronavirus to avoid termination.

These laws differ with regard to the specific regulations but, inter alia, prohibit (or allow municipalities to prohibit) the vacancy of residential space for a certain period of months (which varies from state to state) or the federal states restrict repeated renting as a vacation home (Zweckentfremdungsverbot). On March 4, 2014, the Berlin government passed a regulation (Zweckentfremdungsverbot-Verordnung) which entered into force on May 1, 2014, and applies to the whole city of Berlin. Pursuant to the regulation, any change of use of a residential property requires prior approval of the competent district authority (Bezirksamt). This applies in particular to the use of residential properties as holiday flats or for commercial or professional purposes, a vacancy of residential properties for more than three months, constructional changes which impede the use as residential properties and the elimination of residential properties. The authorities will only grant approval if the public interest in the permanent provision of residential property does not prevail or an adequate substitute of residential property is available.

The energy certificate is a document that assesses the building’s energy efficiency. It shows the energy state of a building and suggests modernization measures for reduction of energy consumption. The energy certificate is generally valid for ten years. Since May 2014, an energy certificate must also be presented to any potential new tenant or potential buyer. Failure to comply can be penalized as an administrative offense. The Energy Savings Regulation (Energieeinsparverordnung) of July 24, 2007, establishes a legal framework regarding the energy requirements of buildings heated or cooled by using energy. It furthermore sets up requirements regarding energy-saving insulation as well as energy-saving technology. Its overall purpose is to reduce the energy demand (Verbrauch) of buildings. In November 2013, the German Federal Government enacted the second regulation amending the Energy Savings Regulation, which came into effect in May 2014. Pursuant to this second regulation, since of January 1, 2016, new buildings have to be built in a more energy efficient way. Compared to the former legal situation, the energy efficiency must increase by 25% with respect to the annual primary energy consumption and by an average of 20% with respect to the thermal insulation of the building shell. As of 2021, European Union law requires that all private buildings must be built satisfying certain low-energy building standards. Already existing buildings (Bestandsgebäude) are subject to energy efficiency requirements in the event of certain substantial renovations. On June 18, 2020, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) passed the German Building Energy Act (Gebäudeenergiegesetz) (the “GEG”), which merges the German Energy Savings Ordinance (Energieeinsparverordnung), the German Energy Act (Energiegesetz) and the German Renewable Energy Heat Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Wärmegesetz). The GEG will be applicable as from November 1, 2020. In particular, it should be noted that gas and oil-heating boilers built-in or installed in 1991 or later may operate for no longer than 30 years. Heating boilers built-in or installed before January 1, 1991 may no longer be operated. The draft contains exceptions therefrom, for example if a house can be supplied neither with gas nor with district heating and the heating cannot be operated also from renewable energies. The GEG provides that ----- the German Federal Government (Bundesregierung) may subsidize the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling and the use of especially energy efficient new buildings and the improvement of the energy efficiency of existing buildings. In order to fulfil the national 2030 climate targets, the federal government announced on September 20, 2019 to introduce emission certificates to the building sector as of 2021. The Federal Government’s climate package has been passed by the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) on December 19, 2019. The certificates will not be sold to the property owners but to the oil and gas companies; the prices for emission certificates will start at €25 per ton of carbon dioxide and will gradually increase over the next few years.

The_ MietNovG is a form of rent control and restricts rent increases for new leases to a maximum of 10% above the locally prevailing comparative rent levels in municipalities or parts of municipalities in which the supply of affordable housing is determined to be threatened (rent cap), unless the rent level agreed with the previous tenant was higher. Furthermore, the restriction on rent increases does not apply to new or fully modernized buildings. The prevailing comparative rent levels are determined on the basis of contractual rents that were agreed upon for comparable residential space in the relevant municipality during the preceding six years. However, rent increases due to modernization measures are not taken into account for determining the prevailing comparative rent levels. Whether residential space is comparable is determined by taking into account its type, size, furnishings, quality, location, including the energy systems and characteristics. For this purpose, the landlord may, in particular, refer to the following: (i) an official rent index (Mietspiegel), (ii) a rent database, (iii) a report from an officially appointed and sworn expert, or (iv) the rent payable for at least three comparable residential units. A rent index is a table that shows the prevailing reference rent in a relevant municipality. The table must be jointly produced or accepted by the municipality or by the landlord and tenant representatives. If the rent index is produced in accordance with recognized scientific principles, it is recognized as a so called qualified rent index (Qualifizierter Mietspiegel). Qualified rent indices, as opposed to simple rent indices, create the (rebuttable) assumption that the listed rent levels reflect the reference rent customary in the relevant municipality. A rent index shall be adjusted to market trends every two years. A qualified rent index must be adjusted every two years; when this is done, a spot check or the trend of the price index for living standards of all private households in Germany, as computed by the Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt), may be used as a basis. A new list reflecting the qualified rent index must be generated every four years. A rent database is a collection of rents maintained on an ongoing basis that is used to determine the reference rent prevailing in a municipality. This option is only suitable for use if the collection of rents among other things (i) draws upon an adequate amount of rent data of existing and new lease agreements which are continuously updated, and which are representative for determining the prevailing rent level for individual properties in the respective locality, and (ii) is recognized by the municipality or by the landlord and tenant representatives. As a result, rent databases are not used in practice. On December 19, 2019, the German federal parliament has resolved that the calculation period for the local comparative rent shall be extended from four to six years to prevent an excessive increase in the local comparative rents. The law entered into force on January 1, 2020. However, until the end of 2020, rent indexes with a reference date before March 1, 2020 can still be drawn up according to the previous regulation (based on four years) if the rent index will be published before January 1, 2021. The first letting of new or thoroughly modernized buildings is excluded from the rent limitation. Until December 31, 2020, the German federal state governments are authorized by the tenancy law amendment act (Mietrechtsnovellierungsgesetz) to identify areas where there is pressure on the residential rental market and impose the rent limitation accordingly for a maximum period of five years. Thus, the rent cap (Mietpreisbremse) only applies in the respective designated areas. The German Federal Government (Bundesregierung) recently extended the period until December 31, 2025. Previously, it was unclear whether the German federal state governments are authorized to re-issue area designation ordinances (Gebietsverordnungen) after the maximum period of five years has elapsed. The amendment expressly provides that the German federal state governments may make multiple use of its authorization to issue such an ordinance. However, the last territorial ordinance must expire on December 31, 2025. The rent cap currently is in force in 12 of 16 German federal states. Berlin has introduced the rent cap by way of a Rent Limit Regulation (Mietenbegrenzungsverordnung) dated April 28, 2015 and with effect from June 1, 2015. Pursuant to the Rent Limit Regulation, Berlin is a designated community with pressure on the residential rental market, in which the supply of the population with sufficient rental housing at reasonable conditions is particularly scarce. The Regional Court (Landgericht) of Berlin considered rent control provisions unconstitutional and presented this legal question to the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht). In its decision of July 18, 2019, the Federal Constitutional Court, however, ruled that rent control as such is indeed constitutional. ----- Furthermore, the MietNovG contains provisions for the payment of the broker’s fee for residential letting. Since June 1, 2015, the landlord is obliged to pay the broker’s fee if the owner commissions the broker (so called orderer principle). A tenant continues to have to pay the broker’s fee, if the tenant commissions the broker to look for an apartment for the tenant. On January 1, 2019, the Tenancy Adjustment Act (Mietrechtsanpassungsgesetz) entered into force, lowering the maximum increase of the annual rent from 11% to 8% of the total cost of the modernization measures. The reduction of the modernization levy is applicable to modernization projects announced from January 1, 2019. Furthermore, a cap of €3.00 per square meter within six years now applies to the allocation of modernization costs. If the rent is less than €7.00 per square meter, the rent may only increase by €2.00 within six years as a result of modernization. Additionally, a targeted modernization in order to induce tenants to terminate the lease (Herausmodernisierung), e.g., a modernization that has only been announced but not carried out or results in significant, objectively unnecessary burdens on the tenant, now constitutes an administrative offence which can be punished with a fine up to €100,000. Furthermore, the Tenancy Adjustment Act tightens the provisions on the enforcement of rent control (Mietpreisbremse) on the landlord’s disadvantage. According to the new provisions, landlords are obliged in certain cases to provide a tenant with unsolicited information about the rent previously agreed for the housing before concluding the rental agreement. In addition, it is now easier for the tenants to complain about the rent control. While the previous situation required the tenant to make a qualified complaint (qualifizierte Rüge) containing the facts on which the complaint was based, a simple complaint suffices under current law. On April 1, 2020, a further amendment of the rent control came into force. Based on this, tenants under leases which were concluded after April 1, 2020 are able to claim back rents paid in excess of the rent control with retroactive effect for a period of up to 2.5 years. In certain cases, retroactive effect of a complaint will remain excluded, namely if the complaint is made later than 2.5 years after the beginning of the tenancy or if the tenancy has already ended. For leases that existed prior to April 1, 2020 it remains unchanged that tenants can only claim rents that become due after the tenant’s complaint.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

On January 30, 2020, the Berlin parliament (Berliner _Abgeordnetenhaus) passed the Law on Rent Limitation in Housing in Berlin (Gesetz zur Mietenbegrenzung im Wohnungswesen in Berlin – MietenWoG Bln) (the “Berlin Rent Limitation Law”). The law entered into force_ on February 23, 2020. The rent freeze has retroactive effect as from June 18, 2019. Excluded from the rent freeze are publicly subsidized housing, flats for which public-sector funds were granted for modernization and repair, and which are subject to a fixed rent (Mietpreisbindung), as well as dormitories, living quarters and new builds from 2014 onwards. Key points of the draft bill are, among others: - The rent freeze will last for five years. As of 2022, lessors may annually increase rents up to 1.3% of the current rent; - The permissible rent limit is determined on the basis of the rents of the official Berlin rent table (“Berliner Mietspiegel”) of the year 2013 as adjusted to reflect the development of real wages until 2019; - When re-letting apartments, the maximum rent amount equals the rent that was agreed upon in the previous lease agreement on June 18, 2019. If this previous rent amount is above the permissible rent limit, it shall be capped; - In existing lease agreements, tenants may elect to reduce their rent if it equals more than 120% of the permissible rent limit. Certain allowances and deductions for the type of location shall be taken into account. The administration can take action ex officio against landlords in the event of violations of the permitted rent amount. These regulations shall begin to apply 9 months after the rent bill is enacted into law; - If the rent of a modern equipped apartment is particularly low (i.e. below €5.02 per sqm), the lessor may raise the rent by a maximum of €1.00 per sqm to a maximum of €5.02 per sqm when re-letting the apartment; and ----- - Modernization measures may only be allocated in the amount of €1.00 per sqm. For costs of modernization exceeding this amount, up to a maximum of one additional Euro per square meter of living space, the Senate will provide subsidy programs. Violations (intentionally or negligently) of the provisions can constitute an administrative offense (Ordnungswidrigkeit) which can be sanctioned with fines up to €500,000. It is expected that the Berlin rent freeze will be challenged in court immediately after its entry into force before the constitutional courts at federal and state level. However, it cannot be excluded that the law will enter into force unchanged or with its essential content. The Regional Court (Landgericht) of Berlin considers the socalled rent freeze to infringe German constitutional law and submitted the question to the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) for a decision. Moreover, on May 6, 2020, certain members of the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) filed an application for judicial review (Normenkontrollantrag) with the German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) to ascertain the compliance of the Berlin Rent Limitation Law with German federal constitutional law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

The protection of ownership in Germany is guaranteed under the Constitutional Act. As a result of this guarantee, the owner of properties is in principle entitled to proceed with the property at his own will and to exclude others from any influence, unless the law or the rights of third parties’ conflict with this. Conversely, the guarantee of property does not per se preclude the state from withdrawing this protected legal position by expropriation. Pursuant to Article 15 sentence 1 Constitutional Act, land, natural resources and means of production may be transferred to common ownership or other forms of public service for the purpose of socialization by a law regulating the nature and extent of compensation. However, there are high legal requirements for the expropriation of the real estate. While the citizen’s initiative in Berlin seems to be primarily directed against Deutsche Wohnen SE, the proposed draft legislation would capture all companies with profit motivation that own at least 3,000 apartments in Berlin. Thus, in addition to Deutsche Wohnen SE other real estate companies would also be affected by the proposed expropriation if the proposed bill is adopted. Although the Constitutional Act provides in principle for compensation in the event of expropriation, it would be possible that such compensation would be significantly lower than the market value of the property. The outcome of the current initiative (“Deutsche Wohnen und Co. enteignen”) in Berlin to hold a referendum to expropriate residential real estate companies is uncertain. If a petition of a referendum has come about, a referendum must rather be brought about. Only if this referendum is successful, the state of Berlin would be obliged to implement the draft law. In this case, it could be assumed that the law on expropriation would be challenged in extensive and lengthy court proceedings. While legal experts have pointed out that there is considerable uncertainty whether the proposed legislative measure would be in line with constitutional law, it cannot be excluded that the objective pursued by the initiative will be achieved in some way in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

The applicable period of these restrictions (Bindungszeitraum) as well as the technical modalities depend on the specific kind of subsidy granted. Further restrictions, for example those relating to the sale and transfer of subsidized property, may apply in individual cases. In particular, these restrictions may result from administrative acts (Verwaltungsakte) or public law contracts (öffentlich-rechtliche Verträge), and, as the case may be, other agreements, such as loan agreements.

In addition, some of these properties are restricted in terms of possible tenants. As of the same date, approximately 29% (by units) of the rent restrictions as a result of subsidies are scheduled to expire by 2022. The Subsidized Properties were subsidized at different times based on various programs and legal bases. The programs include subsidies for new buildings as well as for the modernization and renovation of existing buildings. Accordingly, and depending on the time of the granting of the public subsidies, the statutory bases for the subsidies granted for the Subsidized Properties vary. Statutory bases are mainly found in the First Housing Act (Erstes Wohnungsbaugesetz), which applied from 1950 to 1956, and the Second Housing Act (II. Wohnungsbaugesetz) of 1956, as well as the Controlled Tenancies Act (Wohnungsbindungsgesetz), the 1970 Rent Ordinance for New Construction (Neubaumietenverordnung) and the Second Calculation Ordinance (II. Berechnungsverordnung). These provisions are further specified at the state level. On January 1, 2002, the Housing Assistance Act (Wohnraumförderungsgesetz) replaced the Second Housing Act. However, decisions and measures based on the Second Housing Act remained valid, and the Second Housing Act generally continues to apply to subsidies granted before January 1, 2002 (or, in specific cases, before January 1, 2003). With the enactment of the Housing Assistance Act (Wohnraumförderungsgesetz) in 2002, housing subsidies can be granted by way of loans or grants, guarantees or the provision of building ground at preferential conditions. The Housing Assistance Act (Wohnraumförderungsgesetz) requires such subsidies to be granted on the basis of a subsidy notification (Förderzusage), which can take the form of an administrative act (Verwaltungsakt) or a public law contract (öffentlich-rechtlicher Vertrag). In the subsidy notification, the authority granting the subsidies must specify the conditions under which the subsidy is granted, in particular the purpose, use and amount of the subsidy, as well as restrictions on eligible tenants and rent restrictions (Belegungs- und Mietbindungen) or rights of the authority to assign specific tenants (Belegungsrechte). The applicable period for these restrictions (Bindungszeitraum) will generally also be specified in the subsidy notification. As a consequence, specific restrictions with regards to individual cases generally follow from the subsidy notification. The legislative competence to subsidize social housing was transferred from the Federal Republic of Germany to the German federal states (Länder) as of September 1, 2006. Based on that change of legislative competence, some federal states have since issued new social housing laws. However, federal legislation, in particular the Housing Assistance Act (Wohnraumförderungsgesetz) and the Controlled Tenancies Act (Wohnungsbindungsgesetz), remains applicable to the extent that it is not replaced by legislation of the particular federal state. Berlin has enacted the Law on Social Housing (Wohnraumgesetz Berlin) in 2011 (as last amended on July 20, 2017), which complements federal legislation, but does not substitute it. Depending on the type of subsidy, and the legal basis on which it was granted, the restrictions on the maximum amount of rent and limitations on the group of possible tenants, as well as the applicable restriction periods, vary. For instance, as the result of subsidies granted before the entering into force of the Housing Assistance ----- Act (Wohnraumförderungsgesetz) in 2002, the subsidy recipient may only be able to charge a cost-covering rent (Kostenmiete) during the restriction period as a matter of statutory law. The cost-covering rent is the rent necessary to cover all expenses for the property, including a return on equity capital and is adjusted over time. After public funding has ended, general statutory provisions such as the above-mentioned capping limit which generally limits a rent increase (Section 558 paragraph 3 of the BGB) apply.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Generally, if a property is subsidized with a loan, the competent public authority first issues a subsidy notification. On the basis of this notification, the addressee concludes a loan agreement with either a public authority or a bank. Usually, the subsidy notification refers (either explicitly or indirectly by referring to the subsidized building) to the subsidized loan and vice versa. The consequence of this legal connection is a strong link between the subsidy notification and the subsidized loan. Generally, the subsidized loan agreements stipulate that any right to terminate or revoke the subsidy notification automatically triggers the right to revoke the loan agreement. In other cases, depending on the provisions in the loan agreement, noncompliance with the provisions of the subsidy notification and a subsequent revocation of the subsidy notification will, for example, lead to a right of the lender to claim back or amend the loan agreement or to terminate the contract. On the other hand, non-compliance with the terms of the loan agreement may also affect the subsidy notification, which might provide that a breach of the loan agreement entitles the authority granting the subsidy to withdraw the subsidy notification. Additionally, the subsidy notification or the subsidized loan agreement may also set out conditions for commercial loans which the borrower contracts to finance the subsidized property in addition to the subsidized loan.

The content of the obligation can be enforced by means of an administrative order. Such public easements were established for a number of properties in the portfolio. Various properties of the portfolio are also subject to unification public easements (Vereinigungsbaulasten). These public easements create a single “construction property” (öffentlich-rechtliches Baugrundstück) out of the affected properties which continue to be independent properties under civil law. Many provisions of public building law, such as the requirements of minimum distances between buildings, apply to the construction property as if the plot boundaries did not exist. According to the Berlin building code (Bauordnung Berlin), public easements take effect with their registration in the public easement register. Since public easements attach to the property itself, they can be enforced against the owner of the charged property and against third parties. The public easement is also effective against legal successors (i.e. buyers of the charged properties) and can only be suspended by a waiver of the competent authority. The restrictions resulting from the public easement may affect the value of the charged property. The public easement lapses through written waiver of the competent authority.

By granting the building permit (Baugenehmigung) the competent authority states that the proposed project is in compliance with applicable law, both with regard to federal planning law (Bauplanungsrecht), including provisions of applicable local development plans, and the building law (Bauordnungsrecht) regulated in the respective State Building Acts (Landesbauordnungen). While the planning law rules the purpose for which a property may be used, describing in particular the kind of use and the type and size of buildings permissible, building law determines how buildings may be designed and constructed in order to safeguard safety and the prohibition of dangers.

They are, however, required by law to take into account private interests as well as to pursue a number of prescribed objectives, including sustainable urban development and the protection of natural resources. Formal planning by municipalities under the Federal Building Act (Baugesetzbuch) (the “BauGB”) follows a two-tiered approach. ----- First, each municipality may issue a preparatory land-use plan (Flächennutzungsplan) that represents, with respect to the entire municipal territory, a basic classification of land uses according to urban development objectives and the needs of the respective municipality. For instance, a preparatory land-use plan may determine the purpose or purposes for which specific areas should be used in the future or which areas should be made available for environmental purposes, but it does not, in principal, create or affect individual rights. Second, zoning plans (Bebauungspläne) may determine the specific use of land in designated areas. A zoning plan must comply with the applicable preparatory land-use plan. A zoning plan establishes the legally binding rules with respect to matters such as type and extent of structural use of property, e.g. building plot area and the height, density and specific use of buildings erected on a plot and may also designate land as being reserved for public purposes, industrial use, mixed-use, social housing, infrastructure, open spaces, and protected areas. The zoning plan may also contain provisions on permissible emissions, permissible exterior design of a building or contain other obligations, such as the obligation to plant trees. Where no zoning plan exists, the question whether a building project and/or its specific kind of use is permissible depends on whether the building project is located in the already built-up interior zone (Innenbereich) or in an undeveloped peripheral area (Außenbereich). In the first case, the permissibility basically depends on the building project’s compatibility with the existing buildings in the vicinity and their specific use. Outside of built-up interior zones, projects are only permissible subject to narrowly defined requirements under the BauGB, which are not satisfied by buildings designated for office, retail or logistics use. Municipalities may designate special urban planning zones (Gebiete des besonderen Städtebaurechts) in order to remediate specific planning deficiencies or facilitate specific urban developments. The BauGB provides for different types of special urban planning zones, such as redevelopment areas (Sanierungsgebiete), conservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) or development areas (Entwicklungsgebiete). Both existing properties located in areas that are designated as special urban planning zones following the erection of such properties as well as properties that will be built in such urban planning zones in the future may be subject to certain restrictions. If properties are located within formally designated redevelopment areas, those properties are subject to restrictive regulations of the BauGB, such as municipal pre-emptive rights. In addition, written permission of the municipality is required for certain development projects and legal procedures (e.g., rental agreements for a stipulated period of more than one year, property purchase agreements, the subdivision of a plot or the establishment, modification or revocation of a public easement). The granting of such permission may only be refused if such project would inhibit or seriously impede the implementation of the redevelopment or if it would conflict with the aims and purposes of the redevelopment. The owner of a property may be obliged to use the property in accordance with the aims and purposes of a redevelopment. If the owner does not comply with this requirement, the municipality might expropriate the owner under certain prerequisites. In order to implement the redevelopment, the municipality may undertake infrastructure measures. Furthermore, the owner of a property in a redevelopment area may be obliged to make payments to the respective municipality in order to compensate for the increase in the value of the property as a consequence of the redevelopment.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

However, the competent building authority may, under certain circumstances, require alterations to buildings with respect to safety (e.g., fire safety) or health risks. While mere non-compliance with prevailing regulations generally does not warrant such orders, the occurrence of imminent safety or health risks with respect to users of the building or the general public allows the competent authority to demand immediate action from the owner. Relevant risks in this regard include fire risks, traffic risks, risks of collapse and health risks from hazardous building materials, such as asbestos or water contamination. The protection of existing buildings does not generally cover alterations to such buildings or changes in the type of use. Therefore, in both cases, a new building permit is typically required, which must comply with the then-applicable planning and building regulations. However, the building authority may, under certain circumstances, grant an exemption from the respective provisions of the zoning plan if the intended use or alteration is not covered by such provisions of the zoning plan.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

The competent authorities may determine whether the conservation of a building is in the collective public interest and, therefore, has to be considered protected. As a result, ownership is subject to various public law restrictions. Specific obligations with respect to, e.g., the maintenance, repair, appropriate management and protection of historic buildings arise under the historic buildings preservation laws of the individual German Federal States. In addition, changes to historic buildings or their removal are not permitted if significant conservation reasons exist for maintaining their condition unchanged. Compliance with preservation legislation is also required in the context of planning permission processes, such as for a change of use or for alterations, and may result in the refusal of the required permits. Furthermore, if a building is located in the near surrounding of a building that is subject to monument protection, such building might also be subject to restrictions to the extent it can influence the monumental character of the protected building. With regard to restrictions on use and disposal, some of the ADLER Group’s real estate is situated in preservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) and may in the future be situated in urban redevelopment areas (Sanierungsgebiete). Additionally, some of the real estate is listed as protected historical monuments. The applicable statutory regime in these cases is that of special preservation statutes based on the Federal Building Code (Baugesetzbuch) and the Berlin legislation for the preservation of protected monuments (Denkmalschutzgesetz Berlin). With respect to real estate situated in an urban redevelopment area (Sanierungsgebiet), we are required to obtain the permission of the municipality in particular for demolition or alteration of buildings, entering into lease agreements with a fixed term of more than one year, the sale of the property, the granting of encumbrances and the creation, amendment or suspension of an easement. In addition, at the end of the redevelopment measure the relevant municipality will levy a compensation charge (Ausgleichsbetrag) that is aimed to balance the increased land value in consequence of the redevelopment. The owner of the real estate is responsible for the implementation of the necessary measures defined by the public authorities. Only if the owner is unable to realize the measures quickly and expediently, the authorities may take action instead. A substantial part of the ADLER Group’s real estate is situated in preservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete), which requires it to obtain the permission (irrespective of the requirement of a building permit) of the relevant public authority for demolition, alteration of buildings or change of use. Also, ordinances may determine that permission is required for the establishment of individual ownership for personal use (condominium and partownership) in respect of residential units. Milieu protection areas (Milieuschutzgebiete) as well as preservation areas (Erhaltungsgebiete) are both regulations based on the Federal Building Code (Baugesetzbuch). Preservation areas primarily serve the preservation of the urban characteristic of the area and can be stipulated by local development plans and other local statutes. Milieu protection areas (Milieuschutzgebiete) serve the preservation of the areas as well, focusing on the composition of the resident population in a specific area. In order to preserve the existing composition of the resident population, the Federal Building Code ----- (Baugesetzbuch) enables the federal states to enact ordinances that prohibit the transformation of rented apartments into freehold apartments. As mentioned before, a respective ordinance (Umwandlungsverordnung) was passed by the Berlin government on March 3, 2015, in force until March 13, 2020.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.5,Construction and Planning,1185.5.6,Construction and Property Development Contracts,"_Applicable Provisions of the BGB_ On January 1, 2018, an amendment to the BGB relating to construction contracts came into effect that implements a number of amendments to the BGB relating to agreements in connection with planning and construction works and codifies a range of new types of contracts which so far were not explicitly regulated. These changes are briefly summarized below. The BGB now differentiates, in particular, between construction contracts (Bauverträge), consumer construction contracts (Verbraucherbauverträge) as well as the property development contracts (Bauträgerverträge). In principle, a property development contract is a mixed contract (gemischter Vertrag) covering both aspects of a sales contract (Kaufvertrag) and of a contract for work (Werkvertrag). The newly applicable law now explicitly stipulates that the property development contract is a contract with respect to the construction (Errichtung) or reconstruction (Umbau) of a house or a comparable building and by which the developer is obliged to transfer ownership to the property to be developed. The BGB further includes additional provisions for consumer construction contracts, including property development contracts entered into with private purchasers, such as owner-occupiers and retail buy-to-let investors. Prior to entering into a property development with a private purchaser, the respective real estate developer is required to provide such purchaser with a written description of the building specifications (Baubeschreibung). Such description needs to be provided in good time before entering into the property development contract and also needs to fulfil the requirements set forth in the BGB. In addition, the developer has to inform the purchaser bindingly about the time of completion of the development project or, if such information is not possible at the time of conclusion of the contract, the estimated time needed for realizing the respective development project. Furthermore, the developer also needs to describe in detail the specifications of the building, which include, for instance, a general description of the building to be built, the type and extent of the services offered, general data on the building including floor plans and information on square footage, potentially information on the energy, fire safety and sound proofing standard. Except where a consumer construction contract was notarized, the consumer has a statutory right to rescind the agreement within the statutory periods and the contractor is obligated to duly inform the consumer of such right. Aside from these provisions relating to property development and consumer construction contracts, general rules relating to sales contracts (Kaufverträge) and work contracts (Werkverträge) as well as the German Real Estate Agent and Commercial Contractor Regulation (Makler- und Bauträgerverordnung) (the “MaBV”) apply. In the context of property development contracts (Bauträgerverträge), the BGB provides for additional requirements with respect to the issuance of certain sureties which were introduced by the Act to Secure Contractor Claims and Improve the Enforcement of Payment Claims (Forderungssicherungsgesetz) (the “FoSiG”). In case the recipient of such works is a consumer and instalment payments were agreed by the parties, real estate developers building or remodeling a house or similar construction structure are required to issue a surety (the “FoSiG Surety”) with respect to 5% of the agreed remuneration upon beginning of construction works (i.e., when the first instalment under the MaBV is due and payable). The purpose of the FoSiG Surety is to secure contractual performance in a timely and adequate manner and to provide purchasers a minimum security from the consequences of an insolvency of the respective project developer. The issuance of the FoSiG Surety is mandatory and can only be avoided if such purchasers withhold an amount corresponding to 5% of the aggregate purchase price from their instalment payments. _German Real Estate Agent and Commercial Contractor Regulation (Makler- und Bauträgerverordnung)_ The MaBV is, inter alia, applicable to property development contracts relating to the development and sale of residential properties to owner-occupiers (Selbstnutzer) and retail buy-to-let investors in Germany. The MaBV provides for certain regulations to be complied with by, inter alia, real estate developers in connection with the conclusion of property development contracts (Bauträgerverträge). In particular, the MaBV provides for a staggered payment framework, which entitles a real estate developer to significant fixed down payments in line with the completion of construction milestones, for respective collateralization of such down payments and imposes an obligation on the developer to separate funds received from purchasers from private assets. The real estate developer may request up to seven instalment payments subject to specific construction progress to be ----- included in the individual payment schedule agreed under the property development contract (Bauträgervertrag). Such instalment payments may, however, only be requested if the amount of an instalment payment corresponds to the actual value of the work performed by the real estate developer at the time such instalment payment becomes due and payable. The first construction milestone is the start of ground works (Beginn der Erdarbeiten). Upon the achievement of this milestone, the real estate developer is entitled to request the first instalment in the amount of 30% of the agreed contractual sum in case ownership of a real property is to be transferred and 20% of the agreed contractual sum in case a hereditary building right is to be created or transferred. The second instalment for 40% of the remaining agreed contractual sum is due and payable upon completion of the building shell (including carpentry work) (Rohbaufertigstellung, einschließlich Zimmererarbeiten). As a result, a total of 58% of the aggregate agreed contractual sum under the respective property development contract (Bauträgervertrag) is due and payable upon completion of the building shell if ownership of a real property is to be transferred. Further instalments can be requested in up to seven partial payments in accordance with the following milestones set forth in the MaBV: installation of roof surfaces (Herstellung der Dachflächen), basic installation of heating systems, sanitary and electrical facilities (Rohinstallation der Heizungs-, Sanitär- und Elektroanlagen), window installation (Fenstereinbau), interior plaster work (Innenputzarbeiten), screed work (Estricharbeiten), tiling work in the sanitary area (Fliesenarbeiten im Sanitärbereich), readiness for occupancy and concurrently with the transfer of possession (Bezugsfertigkeit und Zug um Zug gegen Besitzübergabe), facade works (Fassadenarbeiten) a final completion (vollständige Fertigstellung). However, a real estate developer must not request payment of the first instalment from the purchaser unless the following conditions are met: (i) the underlying purchase contract is binding and all necessary approvals were granted, the notary public has confirmed these requirements in writing and no cancelation rights were granted to the purchaser, (ii) a priority notice of conveyance (Auflassungsvormerkung) has been registered in the land register (Grundbuch) with respect to the respective purchaser’s title of ownership, (iii) all mortgages (other than for financing the purchase price for the purchaser) were subordinated to the purchaser’s priority notice of conveyance (Auflassungsvormerkung), and (iv) the building permit (Baugenehmigung) has been obtained (or it has been confirmed that a building permit is not required). In practice, real estate developers often face significant delays when dealing with the land register authorities. As a result, the process of registering of such priority notice of conveyance (Auflassungsvormerkung) may be delayed significantly. In such case, the real estate developer can request instalment payments subject to issuing to the purchaser a surety covering the respective pre-payment amount (“MaBV Aval”). Once either all of the above conditions are met or a corresponding MaBV Aval has been issued, the real estate developer is entitled to request the instalment payments under the agreed payment schedule from the relevant purchaser.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.6,Liability for Environmental Contamination,1185.6.1,Environmental Liability Under Public Law,"_Soil Contamination_ Pursuant to the Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundesbodenschutzgesetz), the parties responsible for environmental contamination include, among others, the party that caused the contamination, its legal successor, the owner of the contaminated property and each previous owner of the contaminated property (if such former owner transferred the property after the entering into force of the Federal Soil Protection Act on March 1, 1999 and knew or should have known about the contamination), as well as the person with actual control over the property. With regard to these potentially liable parties, there is no general ranking as to which of the parties is primarily liable. It is within the discretion of the relevant local authority to decide which party shall be held liable. The party most likely to be held liable is the current owner of the contaminated site, because it is legally entitled to carry out the required remedial measures. Furthermore, the liability of the entities and persons who can be held liable by the authorities for remediation does not require a showing of negligence or intent on the part of the liable parties. ----- The Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundesbodenschutzgesetz) authorizes the local authorities to require risk inspections, investigations, remedial measures, and other necessary measures for the protection against hazardous soil changes or residual environmental contamination. The Federal Soil Protection Act contains a statutory indemnity obligation on the part of the responsible parties that, irrespective of an official order, allocates liability among the parties in accordance with their respective contribution to the cause of the contamination. The indemnity obligation may be waived or transferred by express contractual agreement. _Groundwater Contamination_ According to the Federal Water Resources Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz) and related provisions of the federal and the state environmental protection and water laws the parties responsible for any contamination of water can be held liable for the required remedial measures by the authorities. If the contamination of water has detrimental effects on the property of third parties, the polluters may be held liable for the resulting damage. Such liability exists independently of any potential action taken by the public authorities. _Asbestos_ German law imposes obligations to remediate asbestos contamination under certain circumstances. Under the asbestos guidelines (Asbest-Richtlinien) of the German Federal States, the standard for determining a remediation obligation is the presence of any health threat. The law distinguishes between friable asbestos, which is capable of releasing asbestos fibers into the air as it ages or breaks, and non-friable asbestos, from which asbestos fibers are usually not released and which, therefore, poses a limited risk to human health. Except in the event of structural alterations, there is generally no obligation to remove non-friable asbestos under the asbestos guidelines. Friable asbestos is generally found in construction materials that provide fire safety, noise abatement, moisture protection, heat insulation and thermal protection. The asbestos guidelines set out criteria used in assessing the urgency of remedying contamination, ranging from immediate action (including demolition, removal or coating of the asbestos) to risk assessments at intervals of no more than five years. The removal and disposal of asbestoscontaining materials requires specific safety measures and may trigger elevated costs. In the case of asbestos contamination, a tenant may also assert a right of rent reduction or, in extreme circumstances, termination for good cause. German courts have held that a landlord may be presumed to be in breach of its statutory obligations if the existence of a health threat cannot be excluded. Accordingly, the courts have granted the right to rent reduction even in cases where the asbestos guidelines do not require immediate remediation. Tenants may also claim compensatory damages if the defect was present at the time the contract was concluded, and they may claim compensation for personal suffering (Schmerzensgeld). Finally, tenants also have the right, subject to certain conditions, to remedy the defect on their own and require that their reasonable expenses be reimbursed. _Pentachlorophenol (“PCP”), Lindane, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (“DDT”), and Polychlorinated Biphenyl (“PCB”)_ Due to negative effects on human health, the use of PCP is prohibited. However, PCP may still exist in buildings, such as in wood preservatives, synthetic materials, insulations, or joints as it was used as a fungicide against mold. DDT and Lindane are synthetic pesticides which were also used in wood preservatives, and which are suspected to have serious negative effects on human health. Their use is prohibited. The use of PCB is generally prohibited. However, it has been widely used as a softener in synthetic materials as well as a fire-retardant component in the past and may also negatively affect human health. The existence of PCP, Lindane, DDT and PCB in buildings may, under certain circumstances, entitle the tenant to reduce the rent or to claim damages. Moreover, the remediation of rooms or buildings may be required where PCP, Lindane, DDT and PCB concentrations exceed certain thresholds. In particular with regard to PCB, the owner of a building may be required to remedy PCB sources through the elimination or sealing of construction elements that contain PCB. Remediation measures may become necessary ----- if the PCB concentration in rooms which are designed for human use exceeds 300 nanograms per 1 cubic meter of air. With regard to PCP, further investigations are required if with regard to rooms permanently used for residential purposes the PCP concentration in dust and wood exceeds defined thresholds. If further investigations then show that the PCP concentration exceeds 0.1 microgram per 1 cubic meter of air, further medical tests are required with regard to the residents. Depending on defined thresholds for a maximum PCP concentration a remediation may then be necessary. _War Ordnance_ In Germany, the federal states are responsible for the clearance of ordnance and other remnants of war. In most states, public services are responsible for the clearance of war ordnance, while other states commission private specialized firms. All states assume, and dispose of, unexploded ordnance themselves. However, the extent to which a private investor or an owner of contaminated real estate incurs liabilities in connection with the clearing of remnants of war or ordnance, including preparatory measures like the disposal of plants and layers of soil or preventive search measures, where the initial suspicions prove unfounded, varies from state to state.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

Pursuant to (i) a service agreement between the Company and Maximilian Rienecker and (ii) a managing director’s service agreement between ADO Properties GmbH and Maximilian Rienecker, (collectively, the “MR Service Agreements” and, together with the TB Service Agreement, the “Service Agreements”), Maximilian Rienecker shall receive a fixed gross annual remuneration in the amount of €600,000, payable in 12 equal installments at the end of each calendar month. Compensation of the members of the Senior Management further includes a performance-related annual variable cash payment in the form of a short-term incentive (“STI”) (see “Short-Term Incentive Program (STI)”) and a performance-related variable cash or share payment in the form of a long-term incentive (“LTI”) (see “Long_Term Incentive Program (LTI)”). In addition to the fixed and the variable remuneration, under the Service Agreements, the Board of Directors may, in its reasonable discretion, grant each member of the Senior Management, individually, an additional bonus for outstanding performances without a prior agreement. A legal claim to such a discretionary bonus does however not exist. Furthermore, each member of the Senior Management is entitled to benefits such as the continued payment of the fixed remuneration for a certain period of time in the event of an incapacity to perform services due to illness, payment of contributions to a health insurance (capped at an amount of €1,500 per month), usage of a company car for business and private use (or, if no company car is provided, a monthly payment of €2,000 in lieu thereof), an annual payment of up to €3,000 for purposes of health care as well as reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses, including travel expenses, reasonably incurred in the course of the services as a member of the Senior Management in accordance with the applicable policies of the Company. Further, under the Service Agreements, the Board of Directors may, in its reasonable discretion, grant an additional bonus to each member of the Senior Management for outstanding performances, whereas a legal claim to such discretionary bonus does not exist. During the term of the Service Agreements, each member of the Senior Management is prohibited from working for a company that is a direct or indirect competitor of the Company and prohibited from establishing, acquiring or directly or indirectly investing in such a competitor. However, it is permissible to invest in a competitor to the extent that the interest in such company does not enable the member of the Senior Management to exert any influence on its business activities and does, in any case, not exceed 5% of the share capital of such company. The member of the Senior Management is obligated to notify the Company of any such investments. Furthermore, each member of the Senior Management has agreed to a post-contractual prohibition of competition for a term of three months. During such period, the member of the Senior Management will receive ----- a compensation for each month in the amount of 50% of their most recent total monthly remuneration, whereas the compensation may be reduced under certain circumstances. Additionally, the Company may, prior to termination, waive its rights under the post-contractual non-competition clause, in which case the Company does not have an obligation to pay the compensation. The terms of the service agreement between the member of the Senior Management and the Company began with effect as of the date on which the appointment as member of the Senior Management became effective and runs with a fixed term until December 9, 2023. In the event of a re-appointment as member of the Senior Management, the terms of the service agreement of the member of the Senior Management extend accordingly. The term of the Service Agreements expires on December 9, 2023. In the event of a re-appointment as Daily Manager, the term of the Service Agreements shall be extended accordingly. The Service Agreements shall terminate in the event that the member of the Senior Management is removed or resigns from the position as Daily Manager. The Service Agreements may be terminated by the Company at any time and without prior notice in the event of a material breach of duty of the member of the Senior Management. Furthermore, the Service Agreements may be terminated by written notice, subject to a notice period of 90 days. During such notice period, the Company is entitled to release the member of the Senior Management from his duties. In the event of a termination of the Service Agreements by the Company for reasons other than those for which the member of the Senior Management is responsible, the member of the Senior Management is entitled to a severance payment which may not exceed the lower of (i) two annual remunerations (including entitlements under its STI and LTI) and (ii) the remuneration that would be due for the remaining term under the Service Agreements. In the event that a permanent invalidity is preventing the member of the Senior Management from performing his duties, the Service Agreements automatically expire at the end of the calendar quarter in which such a determination was made. In the event that a change of control occurs or in the event that the member of the Senior Management is removed from his position on the Board of Directors by the general meeting of the Company, the member of the Senior Management may terminate the Service Agreements with a notice period of three months at the end of a calendar month, provided that the termination is submitted to the Company within a period of six months from the day on which the member of the Senior Management becomes aware of the change of control or the loss of the position on the Board of Directors, as applicable. A change of control occurs if one or more third parties acting jointly, and in each case not affiliated with the Company, acquire more than 30% of the stock in the Company and the position as a member of the Senior Management is more than insignificantly affected as a result thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, ADO Group Ltd. and ADLER Real Estate are not deemed to be third parties in this respect). The position of the member of the Senior Management is in particular deemed to be more than insignificantly affected in case of a material (i) change in the strategy of the Company or (ii) change in the position of the member of the Senior Management, or (iii) relocation of the place of work (e.g. abroad or more than 500 km from the current place of work). Upon such a termination of the Service Agreements as a result of a change of control, the member of the Senior Management is, subject to certain conditions, entitled to a severance payment which may not exceed the lower of (i) two annual remunerations (including entitlements under STI and LTI) and (ii) the remuneration that would be due for the remaining term under the Service Agreements. As set forth in the Service Agreements, the Company has included the member of the Senior Management in a D&O group insurance (see “Insurance Coverage”). In addition, the Company had entered into service agreements with previous members of the Senior Management and one former member of the Board of Directors in respect of his role as a Daily Manager, which also contained LTIs. The respective service agreements with the former member of the Board of Directors and the former members of the Senior Management were terminated.

In such event, no Notes will be delivered to investors. Furthermore, the Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Joint Bookrunners against certain liabilities it may incur in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Company is assigned a “Ba2” rating with a stable outlook by Moody’s Investors Service Ltd. (“Moody’s”) as of June 30, 2020. Moody’s has a registered office in the United Kingdom and has been validly registered by ESMA pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 16, 2009 on credit rating agencies, as amended. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization (see: “Risk Factors—Risks related to the ADLER _Group’s Financial Situation —A downgrade or a withdrawal of the Company’s current credit rating may impact our ability to obtain financing or issue further debt and may have a negative impact on our debt costs and on the market price of the Notes.”)._ The following statements are based on the information (in English) on the websites of S&P (standardandpoors.com) and Moody’s (moodys.com) as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. An S&P Global Ratings issuer credit rating is a forward-looking opinion about an obligor’s overall creditworthiness. This opinion focuses on the obligor’s capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due. It does not apply to any specific financial obligation, as it does not take into account the nature of and provisions of the obligation, its standing in bankruptcy or liquidation, statutory preferences, or the legality and enforceability of the obligation. Issuer credit ratings can be either long-term or short-term. The long-term issuer credit rating categories awarded by S&P range from the highest rating “AAA”, which is defined as an extremely strong capacity of an obligor to meet its financial commitments to the lowest rating “D”, which is defined as a default on all or substantially all of an obligor’s financial obligations as they come due, whether long- or short-term, including rated and unrated obligations but excluding hybrid instruments classified as regulatory capital or in nonpayment according to terms. S&P define a “BB” rating for a long-term issuer as follows: An obligor rated “BB” is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics but is less vulnerable in the near term than other lower-rated obligors. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions that could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments. Ratings from “AA” to “CCC” may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the rating categories. Ratings assigned on Moody’s global long-term and short-term rating scales are forward-looking opinions of the relative credit risks of financial obligations issued by non-financial corporates, financial institutions, structured finance vehicles, project finance vehicles, and public sector entities. Moody’s defines credit risk as the risk that an entity may not meet its contractual financial obligations as they come due and any estimated financial loss in the event of default or impairment. Issuers are assigned long-term ratings. The global long-term rating scales awarded by Moody’s range from the highest rating “Aaa” defined as obligations of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk to the lowest rating “C” defined as the lowest rated obligations and typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest. Moody’s defines a “Ba” rating as follows: Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from “Aa” through “Caa”. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,1322,INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE,1322.3,MARKET INSTABILITY Berlin Rental Freeze Law,1322.3.1,,"Since the beginning of 2019, there have been public discussions about a rent freeze proposal for rental apartments in Berlin. The Berlin Parliament (“Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus”) finally enacted the law for rent control in the housing sector (“MietenWoG Bln”) as at 30 January 2020. The law came into force as at 23 February 2020 by its publication in the Berlin Bulletin for Legislation (“Berliner Gesetzes- und Verordnungsblatt”). Berlin is the first federal state which passed such a law. The Berlin Rental Freeze mainly stipulates that rents under existing and new leases for rental apartments built before 2014, with the exception of publicly subsidized residential space and nursing homes, will be frozen for five years at the level as at 18 June 2019. Furthermore, paragraph 5 redefines the upper limit for existing rents which are not allowed to be exceeded by more than 20% in accordance with: - a rental table, with basis rents depending on the construction date and the general fit-out (§ 6, section 1); - a 10% increase for (semi-)detached houses (§ 6, section 2); - one Euro per sq m increase of the upper limit if there is a modern fit-out (§ 6, section 3); - a premium or discount depending on the residential area (§ 5, section 1); With regards to new leases, since 23 February 2020, their rent level has to be calculated similarly, excluding the premium or discount depending on the residential area and without the 20% tolerance limit. For all leases which had been concluded before 23February 2020, landlords have to inform their tenants within two months after the publication of the law about the calculation of the upper limit and the adjustment of the rent (§ 6, section 4). Rents under existing leases as well as under new leases can be increased by a maximum of one Euro per sq m after a comprehensive modernization if it is carried out after the publication of the law (§ 7). According to § 3, section 4, starting from 1 January 2022, the frozen rent level will be allowed to be increased by a maximum of 1.3% annually, in line with the inflation rate, however, the upper limit of the rent is not allowed to be exceeded. Since 31 March 2020, we have adopted and changed our rental cashflow model within our valuations for residential properties in Berlin, in accordance with the Berlin Rental Freeze Law. For new leases, most of our clients have agreed with the tenant that he/she pays the rent in accordance with the new regulation and transfers the difference up to a market rent under the federal rental brake regime (“Mietpreisbremse”) to an escrow account until there is a final legal decision. In terms of the market sentiment, we still observe some strong interest in the Berlin residential sector, even though the number of transactions has significantly decreased which leads to the conclusion that, overall, prices and thus values have not changed significantly.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

However, in Germany, as at the valuation date, transaction volumes for multi-family housing provided enough up-to-date comparable market evidence upon which to base opinions of value.

As part of the previous valuations (see preamble), since 2015 all the properties have been fully inspected (internal and external inspection) at least once. As part of the half-year and year-end valuations, CBRE conducts again external inspections of the entire portfolio. In accordance with the Company’s instruction, the valuation of the assets has been carried out at an individual asset level. For the purpose of the inspections we amalgamated the assets into homogeneous clusters. The cluster criteria were location and situation, type of assets and date of construction. For the inspections, a reference asset was selected from each cluster, on the basis of the desktop analysis and the information available. During our inspections, we verified that each of the buildings of the valuation clusters were internally consistent and checked whether adjoining buildings had homogeneous characteristics that could enable them to be amalgamated. Internal and external parking units and other rent-earning units such as antennas are part of a building unit, except if they are economically independent units. At cluster level, we made an assessment of the situation (“micro location”), the quality level according to the local rental table, the condition of the buildings (asset score) and the typical condition of the apartments, as a basis of our allowances for regular maintenance and tenant improvement costs. At asset level, the basis of valuation calculations, we took individual account of asset-specific parameters such as administration costs, structural vacancy, current rent, market rent, public subsidy (if any), ground leases (where appropriate) and relevant entries in section II of the land register. In accordance with the framework agreement, dated 07 May 2020, CBRE inspects at least 1/3 of the properties per year, thereof 70% of the rental cash flow internally and 30% of the rental cash flow by external inspections. As agreed with the Company, CBRE has so far inspected 314 properties. These were inspected between 10 June 2020 and 03 July 2020. The proportion of the inspected valuation units accounts to approx. 26% of the portfolio’s total Fair Value and to approx. 23% of the portfolio’s total lettable area. CBRE had access to the subject properties in order to carry out the inspections. We have not carried out any building surveys. The properties have not been measured as part of CBRE’s inspection nor have the services or other installations been tested. All of CBRE’s conclusions resulting from the inspection are based purely on visual investigations without any assertion as to their completeness. We would expressly draw your attention to the fact that, in the case of valuations where CBRE does not carry out an inspection, individual property and location characteristics are generally not assessed to the same degree as in the case of a full inspection. The assumptions concerning the factors which affect value - specifically the location, the site and the building quality i.e. the general condition - may, therefore, deviate from the actual characteristics and consequently result in a deviational Value. Similarly, a plausibility check of the information which was made available to us (e.g. a floor schedule) will not be possible without carrying out an inspection. In accordance with the Company’s instruction, the valuation of the assets has been carried out at an individual asset level. For the purpose of the inspections we amalgamated the assets into homogeneous clusters. The cluster criteria were location and situation, type of assets and date of construction. For the inspections, a reference asset was selected from each cluster, on the basis of the desktop analysis and the information available. During our inspections, we verified that each of the buildings of the valuation clusters were internally consistent and checked whether adjoining buildings had homogeneous characteristics that could enable them to be amalgamated. Internal and external parking units and other rent-earning units such as antennas are part of a building unit, except if they are economically independent units. At cluster level, we made an assessment of the situation (“micro location”), the quality level according to the local rental table, the condition of the buildings (asset score) and the typical condition of the apartments, as a basis of our allowances for regular maintenance and tenant improvement costs. At asset level, the basis of valuation calculations, we took individual account of asset-specific parameters such as administration costs, structural vacancy, current rent, market rent, public subsidy (if any), ground leases (where appropriate) and relevant entries in section II of the land register. In accordance with the framework agreement, dated 07 May 2020, CBRE inspects at least 1/3 of the properties per year, thereof 70% of the rental cash flow internally and 30% of the rental cash flow by external inspections. As agreed with the Company, CBRE has so far inspected a total of 110 properties. These were inspected between 24 June 2020 and 03 July 2020. The proportion of the inspected valuation units accounts to approx. 39% of the portfolio’s total Fair Value and to approx. 35% of the portfolio’s total lettable area. CBRE had access to the subject properties in order to carry out the inspection. We have not carried out any building surveys. The properties have not been measured as part of CBRE’s inspection nor have the services or other installations been tested. All of CBRE’s conclusions resulting from the inspection are based purely on visual investigations without any assertion as to their completeness. We would expressly draw your attention to the fact that, in the case of valuations where CBRE does not carry out an inspection, individual property and location characteristics are generally not assessed to the same degree as in the case of a full inspection. The assumptions concerning the factors which affect value - specifically the location, the site and the building quality i.e. the general condition - may, therefore, deviate from the actual characteristics and consequently result in a deviational Value. Similarly, a plausibility check of the information which was made available to us (e.g. a floor schedule) will not be possible without carrying out an inspection.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2139,SUMMARY OF THE VALUATION CONCLUSIONS,2139.41,3.2** **Method of Valuation 3.2.1** **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF),2139.41.1,,"The determination of the Fair Value of the individual assets has been carried out using the internationally recognised Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. This method, which is based on dynamic investment calculations, allows valuation parameters to be reflected explicitly and, therefore, combines a transparent arithmetical determination of Market Value with comparison elements (in relation to market rents, costs, Fair Value etc.). In the DCF method, the future income and expenditure flows associated with the subject asset are explicitly forecasted over a 10-year period of detailed consideration, assuming a letting scenario which does not take into account any potential privatisations of individual apartments. The cash flows calculated for the period of detailed consideration are discounted, monthly in advance, to the date of valuation, allowing the effect on the current Market Value of the receipts and payments at varying dates during the 10-year period to be properly reflected. The discount rate chosen reflects not only the market situation, location, condition and letting situation of the asset and the yield expectations of a potential investor but also the level of security of the forecast future cash flows. As the discounting process means that the effect of future cash flows reduces in importance while at the same time the uncertainty of forecasting tends to increase over time, it is usual in real estate investment considerations for the sustainable net rental income after a ten-year time horizon (the period of detailed consideration) to be capitalised, using a growth-implicit yield, and then discounted to the date of valuation. The assumptions adopted in the valuation model reflect the average estimates based on comparable data (if available) that would be made at the respective date of valuation by investors active in the market. The result of the DCF method is, therefore, the price that a relevant investor in the market would be prepared to pay for the asset at the respective date of valuation, in order to achieve a return from the proposed investment that is in line with present asset market expectations.

The Berlin Parliament (“Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus”) finally enacted the law for rent control in the housing sector (“MietenWoG Bln”) as at 30 January 2020. The law came into force as at 23 February 2020 by its publication in the Berlin Bulletin for Legislation (“Berliner Gesetzes- und Verordnungsblatt”). Berlin is the first federal state which passed such a law. The Berlin Rental Freeze mainly stipulates that rents under existing and new leases for rental apartments built before 2014, with the exception of publicly subsidized residential space and nursing homes, will be frozen for five years at the level as at 18 June 2019. Furthermore, paragraph 5 redefines the upper limit for existing rents which are not allowed to be exceeded by more than 20% in accordance with: ----- - a rental table, with basis rents depending on the construction date and the general fit-out (§ 6, section 1); - a 10% increase for (semi-)detached houses (§ 6, section 2); - one Euro per sq m increase of the upper limit if there is a modern fit-out (§ 6, section 3); - a premium or discount depending on the residential area (§ 5, section 1); With regards to new leases, since 23 February 2020, their rent level has to be calculated similarly, excluding the premium or discount depending on the residential area and without the 20% tolerance limit. For all leases which had been concluded before 23February 2020, landlords have to inform their tenants within two months after the publication of the law about the calculation of the upper limit and the adjustment of the rent (§ 6, section 4). Rents under existing leases as well as under new leases can be increased by a maximum of one Euro per sq m after a comprehensive modernization if it is carried out after the publication of the law (§ 7). According to § 3, section 4, starting from 1 January 2022, the frozen rent level will be allowed to be increased by a maximum of 1.3% annually, in line with the inflation rate, however, the upper limit of the rent is not allowed to be exceeded. Since 31 March 2020, we have adopted and changed our rental cashflow model within our valuations for residential properties in Berlin, in accordance with the Berlin Rental Freeze Law. For new leases, most of our clients have agreed with the tenant that he/she pays the rent in accordance with the new regulation and transfers the difference up to a market rent under the federal rental brake regime (“Mietpreisbremse”) to an escrow account until there is a final legal decision. In terms of the market sentiment, we still observe some strong interest in the Berlin residential sector, even though the number of transactions has significantly decreased which leads to the conclusion that, overall, prices and thus values have not changed significantly.

Starting from a basic rate for each location, additions and deductions are made according to various criteria specific to the buildings concerned: Adjustment for commercial proportion Commercial proportion up to 5% 0.00% Commercial proportion up to 20% 0.25% Commercial proportion up to 50% 0.50% Commercial proportion up to 50% 1.00% Adjustment for quality of situation Very good residential area 1 -0.50% Good residential area 2 -0.25% Medium residential area 3 0.00% Modest residential area 4 0.25% Adjustment for size of building No. of storeys: up to 4 0.00% No. of storeys: up to 6 0.10% No. of storeys: more than 7 0.20% Adjustment for type of building Detached house 1 -1.00% Duplex/semi-detached/terraced house 2 -0.75% Apartment building 3 0.00% Other adjustments Addition for stove heating 0.40% Addition for ground lease 0.25% Deduction for new buildings -0.50% Additionally, the Discount Rate and Capitalisation Rate can be adjusted individually in accordance with the following criteria: - The current letting situation in the property as regards vacancy, over-rented or under-rented status, the quality of the tenancy structure, and for commercial leases the remaining lease term, the indexation provisions and extension options - The nature of the property, its age, size and condition - Additional risk adjustments to take into account uncertainties in the forecasting of future cash flows For example, the limited risk of a lower subsidised rent compared to rents on market level can be reflected in a reduced Discount Rate and/or Capitalisation Rate. On the other hand, a current rent above market level implies the risk that the current rent cannot be achieved in the future; to reflect this a risk premium is appropriate and required. The Capitalisation Rate is used to capitalise the net rental income after the cashflow period (“Exit Value”). This net rental income comprises the assumed rental income at that time less the non-recoverable operating costs. The cash flows and the Exit Value are discounted using the selected Discount Rate, monthly in advance. The resulting net present values were checked against our analysis of comparable transactions (if available) from the sale price data collected by the relevant local valuation committee (Gutachterausschuss) and an analysis of the internal lease and sale database of the CBRE Valuation Department. If necessary, in the absence of transaction data, asking prices for comparable assets on offer at Value AG were also considered. If, in particular instances, results of our DCF calculations were found not to reflect the Fair Value of an individual building, the calculation was adjusted by means of a change in the discount rate and Capitalisation Rate using expert and experienced judgement. |Adjustment for commercial proportion|Col2|Col3| |---|---|---| |Commercial proportion up to|5%|0.00%| |Commercial proportion up to|20%|0.25%| |Commercial proportion up to|50%|0.50%| |Commercial proportion up to|50%|1.00%| |Adjustment for quality of situation||| |Very good residential area|1|-0.50%| |Good residential area|2|-0.25%| |Medium residential area|3|0.00%| |Modest residential area|4|0.25%| |Adjustment for size of building||| |No. of storeys: up to|4|0.00%| |No. of storeys: up to|6|0.10%| |No. of storeys: more than|7|0.20%| |Adjustment for type of building||| |Detached house|1|-1.00%| |Duplex/semi-detached/terraced house|2|-0.75%| |Apartment building|3|0.00%| |Other adjustments||| |Addition for stove heating||0.40%| |Addition for ground lease||0.25%| |Deduction for new buildings||-0.50%| ----- For the subject properties we have adopted a Discount Rate of 3.45% to 6,70% (weighted average of 5.07%) and an Exit Cap Rate of 1.80% to 5.45% (weighted average of 3.73%).",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2139,SUMMARY OF THE VALUATION CONCLUSIONS,2139.65,3.4.12** **Market Rent,2139.65.1,,"The market rents adopted for properties which are not governed by the capping of rents of new leases (“Mietpreisbremse”) are in accordance with the results of the recent lease agreements (12 months), our internal CBRE rental data base and other internal sources, the internet data base Value AG (asking rents) and the local rental tables (Mietspiegel) for residential rents, if available. Since 1 June 2015 the capping of rents of new leases is in force, which enables the federal states to establish individual decrees. The new law limiting rent increases (MietNovG) upon re-letting of existing residential units in regions with low supply only allows an increase of rent up to local rental table level plus 10%. This law applies for five years. There are, however, exceptions: residential units completed after 1 October 2014 are not affected as well as rent increases reflecting modernisation works, pursuant to § 559 section 1 to 3 BGB (German civil code). In such cases, 11% of the total CapEx may still be recouped from the tenant each year. This new law also does not apply for the small market segment of furnished apartments. The city states Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg were joined by more than 300 local authorities in the federal states of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Brandenburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North RhineWestphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia in introducing the Mietpreisbremse (capping of rents on re-letting). However, according to CBRE research, neither Bremen nor approx. 200 of these local authorities have either a simple or qualified rent index (as of 30 June 2020). In our valuation, for the determination of the market rent of properties located in cities where the brake on rents (Mietpreisbremse) has already been implemented we have adopted the below-explained approach. 1. The upper limit of market rents (rents upon re-letting) is determined on rental unit level. An auxiliary calculation provides an overview of market rents on property level based on the weighted floor areas of the individual residential units. 2. In cases where the subject property’s rents upon re-letting are not aligned with the Local Rental Table (Mietspiegel), we have calculated the maximum rents upon re-letting, which can be adopted, as follows: (Local Rental Table Average plus Local Rental Table Maximum) / 2 + 10% 3. Additional Check: if the last rent of an apartment is higher than the calculated rent upon re-letting, then the last rent is taken into consideration 4. Should the determined upper limit of the market rent exceed the rent achieved by documented recent leases, we then do not adopt the higher rent by default but the actually achievable rent. 5. For locations where the capping of rents of new leases applies without any existing local rental table we determine the market rent as before the introduction of the capping. This approach does not apply for valuation units which are affected by the current Berlin Rental Freeze Law.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2139,SUMMARY OF THE VALUATION CONCLUSIONS,2139.71,3.4.16** **Land Register Section II,2139.71.1,,"With reference to the land register extracts provided by the Company, for 206 of the 422 valuation units encumbrances or easements are entered in land register section II. The entries are common agreements in terms of infrastructure provision for the properties or adjacent properties. Based on the inspections as well as in consideration of the entry dates, we have assumed that there are no entries, information or circumstances that could have an impact on Fair Values (including any easements, restrictions, or similar restrictions and encumbrances). We reserve the right to amend our valuation should any such factors be found to exist. One notable exception is the valuation unit VU_1061 (Steglitzer Damm 42-46; Kellerstr. 3, 12169 Berlin). There is a limited personal easement which specifies a right of residence (“Wohnrecht”). We have taken the loss of rent into account with a deduction of 37,287 EUR (“Other influences”).

The Berlin Parliament (“Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus”) finally enacted the law for rent control in the housing sector (“MietenWoG Bln”) as at 30 January 2020. The law came into force as at 23 February 2020 by its publication in the Berlin Bulletin for Legislation (“Berliner Gesetzes- und Verordnungsblatt”). Berlin is the first federal state which passed such a law. The Berlin Rental Freeze mainly stipulates that rents under existing and new leases for rental apartments built before 2014, with the exception of publicly subsidized residential space and nursing homes, will be frozen for five years at the level as at 18 June 2019. Furthermore, paragraph 5 redefines the upper limit for existing rents which are not allowed to be exceeded by more than 20% in accordance with: - a rental table, with basis rents depending on the construction date and the general fit-out (§ 6, section 1); - a 10% increase for (semi-)detached houses (§ 6, section 2); - one Euro per sq m increase of the upper limit if there is a modern fit-out (§ 6, section 3); - a premium or discount depending on the residential area (§ 5, section 1); With regards to new leases, since 23 February 2020, their rent level has to be calculated similarly, excluding the premium or discount depending on the residential area and without the 20% tolerance limit. For all leases which had been concluded before 23February 2020, landlords have to inform their tenants within two months after the publication of the law about the calculation of the upper limit and the adjustment of the rent (§ 6, section 4). Rents under existing leases as well as under new leases can be increased by a maximum of one Euro per sq m after a comprehensive modernization if it is carried out after the publication of the law (§ 7). According to § 3, section 4, starting from 1 January 2022, the frozen rent level will be allowed to be increased by a maximum of 1.3% annually, in line with the inflation rate, however, the upper limit of the rent is not allowed to be exceeded. Since 31 March 2020, we have adopted and changed our rental cashflow model within our valuations for residential properties in Berlin, in accordance with the Berlin Rental Freeze Law. For new leases, most of our clients have agreed with the tenant that he/she pays the rent in accordance with the new regulation and transfers the difference up to a market rent under the federal rental brake regime (“Mietpreisbremse”) to an escrow account until there is a final legal decision. In terms of the market sentiment, we still observe some strong interest in the Berlin residential sector, even though the number of transactions has significantly decreased which leads to the conclusion that, overall, prices and thus values have not changed significantly.",N/A,as_expected,2020,431

As per instructions, the updated valuation was based on a desktop analysis without conducting new property inspections. According to information provided by the Principal, the properties are in comparable conditions as found in the last inspections in regard to their main structural features. The properties were inspected anew in July (Düsseldorf) resp. January 2020 (Frankfurt am Main). According to VPS 2 paragraph 1.8 RICS Red Book the valuer should consider whether the infor mation, supplied by a party other than the valuer, is credible and may be relied on. Information on construction costs for the properties, development times and compensated services/pro gress of construction were provided by the owner. These were compared e.g. with BKI Bau kosten in accordance with the planned standard. The market value was determined at individual property level without taking into account the fact that the properties were part of a portfolio. Therefore, no portfolio discounts or premiums were taken into account. The market value of the portfolio thus corresponds to the sum of the individual market values of the properties to be valued.

Due to the travel restrictions that have arisen and the requirements to limit personal contacts, the otherwise obligatory external and internal inspections of the properties were only partially possible. The delta of the accounted construction costs for the properties as of 30 June 2020 compared to the last valuation with a valuation date being 29 February 2020 was provided to us by the client. Furthermore we received updated planning costs for a few properties. We were informed by the Principal that the properties are also in mainly comparable conditions as found in the last valuation. The properties to be valued consisted of projects for portfolio management as well as proper ties already sold in a forward deal or as condominiums.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2140,4** **VALUATION CONCLUSIONS,2140.42,1.6.** **Valuation Methodology,2140.42.1,,"The valued properties are project developments which are valued according to the residual value method, based on the progress of the development of the project as of the valuation date. The residual value method is a common approach to calculating the value of project develop ments. It is a deductive method for deriving the value of an undeveloped land plot or of devel opment projects based on their respective development progress. The approach is based on the assumption that the market value of a project development can be derived from the future notional market value of the completed project less the services that still need to be consid ered for realisation. NAI apollo's residual value model has the following structure: In the first step the fictitious (gross) market value of the completed project was determined. Since this is a value that can only be realised in the future, it was discounted over the develop ment period. In the next step, the estimated market value of the finished project value was ad justed by usual development discounts, project developer risks, marketing costs as well as the ----- still necessary completion expenses (remaining construction and financing costs). Information provided by the project developer was used to estimate the development times and comple tion costs (budget and construction progress). The information was reviewed. Finally, the result ing (gross) residual value was adjusted by the transaction costs to be borne by a buyer. In the event of completion and discontinuation of project-specific discounting and services, the resid-ual value model used here is converted to an income value model (known as the initial yield method). NAI apollo used different approaches to the valuation depending on the respective property status: 1.6.1. Existing Properties NAI apollo used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the market value of the sub ject properties. The cash flows are projected according to the above structure for a holding pe riod of 10 years and subsequently discounted to the dates of valuation. At the end of the holding period, a sale of the asset is assumed to estimate the present value of the cash flow beyond the holding period. The terminal value, or sometimes referred to as ‘exit value’, is also discounted to the valuation date to determine its present value. The sum of all present values adds up to the gross capital value (GCV) of the investment. By deducting usual transaction costs that a potential investor will face in an asset deal (as the RICS definition of ‘market value’ assumes an asset to be traded at the valuation date), NAI apollo arrives at the net capital value (NCV). The rounded NCV is the market value. 1.6.2. Development Properties The valued properties are project developments which are valued according to the residual value method, based on the progress of the development of the project as of the valuation date. The portfolio includes project developments that have been sold by way of forward agreements. ----- The residual value method is a common approach to calculating the value of project develop ments.

NAI apollo's residual value model has the following structure: In the first step the fictitious (gross) market value of the completed project was determined. In the case of projects already marketed as forward deals, the (gross) sales price agreed in the purchase contract and plausibly verified by NAI apollo was used. Since this is a value that can only be realised in the future, it was discounted over the development period. In the next step, the estimated market value of the finished project value was adjusted by usual development discounts, project developer risks, marketing costs as well as the still necessary completion ex penses (remaining construction and financing costs).

On July 2, 2020, the Company launched the issue of 30,819,391 newly issued shares in dematerialized form with no nominal value in connection with a capital increase against contribution in cash with subscription rights for existing shareholders of the Company and gross proceeds in an amount of €450 million, which was settled on July 24, 2020. On July 6, 2020, the Consus Real Estate Call Option Exercise was settled by transfer of newly issued shares in the Company and transfer of the Company’s treasury shares previously indirectly held by ADLER Real Estate, whereafter Consus Real Estate became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. On July 29, 2020, the Company successfully placed €400 million fixed rate senior unsecured notes with a 5year maturity and a 3.25% fixed coupon with institutional investors. The proceeds were used to repay existing short-dated indebtedness and thus extend the Company’s average debt maturity. On August 26, 2020, ADLER Real Estate informed the management board of WESTGRUND, with reference to ADLER Real Estate’s formal request dated December 29, 2016 in relation to the transfer of the shares of WESTGRUND’s minority shareholders to ADLER Real Estate by way of squeeze-out, that a company valuation of WESTGRUND had been commissioned to determine the appropriate cash compensation for such share transfer according to Section 327a (1) sentence 1 AktG. The transfer of the shares of the remaining minority shareholders of WESTGRUND must be resolved by the general shareholder’s meeting of WESTGRUND. On September 18, 2020, ADLER Real Estate announced the sale of approximately 5,000 residential and commercial units, representing approximately 18% of its portfolio outside ADLER Real Estate’s top 13 cities and generating an annual net rental income of €18.6 million. The net proceeds of approximately €237 million will be used to further strengthen ADLER Real Estate’s balance sheet in accordance with ADLER Real Estate’s commitment to reduce debt (see “Sale Agreement with Peach Property”). On September 29, 2020 and October 1, 2020, respectively, the management board of ADLER Real Estate resolved on and the supervisory board of ADLER Real Estate approved the implementation of a capital increase against contribution in kind and in partial utilization of the authorized capital of ADLER Real Estate, whereby the Company is exclusively admitted to subscribe to newly issued shares of ADLER Real Estate against contribution of approximately €478.2 million and the transfer of treasury shares of ADLER Real Estate in respect of approximately €21.8 million of the receivable under an existing shareholder loan granted by the Company to its subsidiary ADLER Real Estate on April 14, 2020.

5_1,Offerings 2020.md,2140,4** **VALUATION CONCLUSIONS,2140.90,Outlook,2140.90.1,,"We expect the development of real property prices, the dynamic uptrend in rents, higher purchase prices in Germany (especially in major cities), and strong population growth to continue contributing to the strong fundamentals of the German residential real estate market. Measures to counteract increasing rent levels, such as the “Mietendeckel” (rent cap) in Berlin, have negatively affected the real estate market, even though strict rental limitations and controls have already existed in Germany for some time. The immediate future of the Berlin real estate market will be challenging for property owners but, outside of Berlin, certain market ----- fundamentals, such as the housing deficit, population growth, negative interest rates, and cheap mortgages, continue to be intact. The Coronavirus has resulted in a deterioration of the political, socio-economic and financial situation in Germany. Despite various governmental counter-measures, including lock-down measures throughout Germany, the Coronavirus is still rapidly expanding. As the Coronavirus continues to spread, the magnitude of its impact on our business cannot be adequately predicted or reliably quantified as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Following a successful Integration, the Combined Group will implement the strategy pursued with the business combination and consolidate its position as one of the leading German residential real estate companies with improved governance and leverage the expected synergies (see “Reasons for the Business Combination”). Moreover, the Combined Group intends to expand it operational strategy and increase the share of real estate development in its overall business operations. Also, the Combined Group will streamline its property portfolio by making opportunistic divestments at attractive sales prices and in cases where, in its estimation, the affected property does not promise to add value to the existing portfolio. Furthermore, the Combined Group will seek to opportunistically use attractive refinancing possibilities, including through the issuance of bonds. The Company has issued a profit forecast as set out under “Profit Forecast”. Assuming the ADLER Real Estate Group had been consolidated as of January 1, 2020, we would expect our FFO 1 to range between €120 million and €140 million and our net rental income to range between €340 million and €360 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, subject to the assumptions set out under “Profit Forecast”. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,431
