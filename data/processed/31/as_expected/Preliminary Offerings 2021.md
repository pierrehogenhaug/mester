provided that investors resident in a Member State of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom

accepting this e-mail and by accessing the Offering Memorandum, you shall be deemed to have represented to
us and the initial purchasers set forth in the Offering Memorandum (the “Initial Purchasers”) that:

-----

(b) (i) not a U.S. person and are outside the United Sates in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S and (ii) the e-mail address that you have us and to which the e-mail has been
delivered is not located in the United States, its territories and possessions (including Puerto
Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island and the Northern Mariana
Islands), any State of the United States or the District of Columbia (and if you are in a Member
State of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you are not a retail investor).

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be relying on the
exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of
the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors:** The debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum are
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client (as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (“MiFID II”)), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client (as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II) or (iii) not a qualified investor (as
defined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended (the “Prospectus Regulation”)). Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or
distributing such debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any
offer of such debt securities in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under
the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such debt securities. The
Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MiFID II product governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market:** Solely for the purposes
of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities
described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt
securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only (each as defined in MiFID II) and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities
(by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum are**
not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of (i) a retail client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”)), (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended,
“FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA) or (iii) not a
qualified investor (as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”)). Consequently, no key information document required
by PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK
has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available


-----

Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of such debt securities in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to

otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated, all such persons together being referred
to as “Relevant Persons.” The Offering Memorandum is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be
acted on or relied upon by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any investment or investment activity to

of the product approval process of each manufacturer for the purposes of the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (each a
“UK Manufacturer” and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the
debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
such debt securities is only eligible counterparties (as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“COBS”)) and professional clients (as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”)) and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt
securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the UK
Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product
Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt
securities (by either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **IN THE UNITED STATES**


## Constellation Automotive Financing plc
#### £650,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2027


Constellation Automotive Financing plc (the “Issuer”), a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, is offering
£650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its % senior secured notes due 2027 (the “Notes”). The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually
in arrear on each and, commencing on, 2021. The Notes will mature on, 2027. The Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Constellation Automotive Group Limited (the “Parent”), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The gross
proceeds from the offering of the Notes (the “Offering”) will be used, together with the proceeds from other financing transactions described herein, to
(i) repay in full the outstanding borrowings under the Existing Senior Term Loan Facilities, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Second
Lien Facility and the Existing Liquidity Facility (each as defined herein) (together, the “Existing Facilities”), (ii) make a distribution to the direct parent
company of the Parent and (iii) pay costs, fees and expenses (including prepayment costs) incurred in connection with the Refinancing Transactions (as
defined herein). See “Use of Proceeds.”
The Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at any time prior to, 2023 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, to, but excluding, the
date of redemption, plus the applicable “make whole”premium as set forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (this “Offering Memorandum”). At
any time prior to 2023, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity
offerings at a redemption price equal to %, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, provided that at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount (including any additional Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption
(unless all Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently). At any time prior to, 2023, the Issuer may also redeem during each calendar year
commencing with the Issue Date (as defined herein) up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, at its option, from time to
time, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any. The Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after, 2023 at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. The Issuer may also redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. See “Description
_of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_
Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer may be required to offer to redeem the Notes at 101% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” A change of control,
however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In
addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
outstanding series of Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right
to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder
of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”
On the Issue Date, the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (i) on the Issue Date,
by the Parent, Constellation Automotive Limited (“Constellation Automotive”), BCA Central Limited (“BCA Central,”and together with the Parent and
Constellation Automotive, the “Initial Guarantors,” and such guarantees provided, the “Initial Guarantees”) and (ii) within two business days from the
Issue Date, by the Additional Guarantors (as defined herein, and such guarantees provided, the “Additional Guarantees” and, together with the Initial
Guarantees, the “Guarantees” and each, a “Guarantee”). The Initial Guarantors and the Additional Guarantors are collectively referred to as
“Guarantors” and each, a “Guarantor.” The Guarantee of each Guarantor will rank equal in right of payment with such Guarantor’s existing or future
obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee, and will be secured by the Collateral (as defined herein).
On the Issue Date, subject to the release of security in respect of the Existing Facilities (as defined herein), the Notes will be secured on a first-priority
basis by the Initial Collateral (as defined herein), and within two business days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by
the Post-Closing Collateral (as defined herein, and together with the Initial Collateral, the “Collateral”). The Collateral will also secure borrowings under
the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Second Lien Facility (each as defined herein) and certain hedging obligations, if any.
The Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing or future obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any. See
“Description of Other Financial Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”
The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and the liability of each Guarantor and security provider will be subject to certain
limitations, including the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein). See also “Certain Insolvency and Local Law Limitations.” The security interests
in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”)
for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and admission to trade on the Exchange. There is
no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. The Exchange is not a regulated market for purposes of the provisions of
Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (“MiFID II”).
**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 29.**
Issue price of the Notes: % plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.
The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the
securities laws of any State of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold in the United States only to
“qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and to persons who are not a U.S. person (as
defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”)) and who are outside of the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S. Prospective purchasers of the Notes that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the seller may be relying on the exemption
from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see
“Transfer Restrictions.”

“Issue Date”).

Euroclear and Clearstream and their direct and indirect participants, as applicable. After the initial issuance
of the global notes, the Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global notes only as set
forth in the Indenture (as defined herein). See “Book-entry, Delivery and Form.”

We reserve the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. We are making the Offering subject to the terms
described in this Offering Memorandum and the purchase agreement relating to the Notes (the “Purchase
_Agreement”). We and the Initial Purchasers also reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in_
whole or in part for any reason or no reason and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the full
amount of the Notes sought by it. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities may
acquire, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, and
we will submit this Offering Memorandum to the competent authority in connection with the listing
application. In the course of any review by the competent authority, we may be requested to make changes to
the financial and other information included in this Offering Memorandum in producing listing particulars
for such listing. Comments by the competent authority may require significant modification or reformulation
of information contained in this Offering Memorandum or may require the inclusion of additional
information. We may also be required to update the information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect
changes in our business, financial condition or results of operations and prospects. We cannot guarantee that
our application for admission of the Notes on the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Notes is
not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

**STABILIZATION**

IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES, BARCLAYS BANK PLC (THE
“STABILIZING MANAGER”) (OR PERSONS ACTING ON ITS BEHALF) MAY OVER-ALLOT THE
NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE
OF THE NOTES DURING THE STABILIZATION PERIOD AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT
WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, STABILIZATION ACTION MAY NOT
NECESSARILY OCCUR. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DATE
OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES
AND, IF BEGUN, MAY CEASE AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER THAN 30
CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER RECEIVED THE PROCEEDS OF
THE OFFERING, OR NO LATER THAN 60 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE
ALLOTMENT OF THE NOTES, WHICHEVER IS THE EARLIER. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION
OR OVERALLOTMENT MUST BE CONDUCTED BY THE STABILIZING MANAGER (OR
PERSONS ACTING ON ITS BEHALF) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND
RULES.

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Memorandum under the section entitled “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT CYCLE**

We expect that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date,
which will be ten business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein


-----

referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act (as defined herein), trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the
next seven business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+10, to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers
of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven business days should consult
their advisors.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than the Issuer and will
not be responsible to anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections afforded to its clients nor for
providing advice in relation to the Offering.

**United States**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or with any
securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction in the United States and may not be offered
or sold in the United States, except to qualified institutional buyers within the meaning of Rule 144A, in
reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.
The Notes may be offered and sold to persons who are not U.S. persons and are outside the United States in
reliance on Regulation S. Prospective investors are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be relying on
the exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.
For a description of certain restrictions on transfers of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”

Neither the SEC, any U.S. state securities commission nor any non-U.S. securities authority has approved or
disapproved of these securities or determined that this Offering Memorandum is accurate or complete. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offence.

**European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client (as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II)
or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus
_Regulation”)). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as_
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the EEA will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation.

**_MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties
and professional clients only, each (as defined in MiFID II); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes
to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling
or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum and any other material in relation to the Notes are being distributed only to and
are directed only at persons who are (i) persons having professional experience in matters relating to
investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”) or (ii) persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (such as high net
worth companies or unincorporated associations) of the Order, (iii) outside the United Kingdom; or
(iv) persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated, all such
persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons.” This Offering Memorandum is directed only at
Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied upon by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any


-----

investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum related is available only to Relevant
Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(“EUWA”)), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA) or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in Article 2 of
the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus
_Regulation”)). Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms_
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing
the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore
offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

**_UK MiFIR product governance/Professional investors and ECPs only target market_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer (for the purposes of the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook) (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
_Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in_
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties (as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”)), and
professional clients (as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
EUWA (“UK MiFIR”)) and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however,
a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Jersey_**

No person shall, without the consent of the Jersey Financial Services Commission, circulate in Jersey any
offer for subscription, sale or exchange of the Notes.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws
of certain jurisdictions, including statements under the sections entitled “Summary,” “Risk Factors,”
“Operating and Financial Review,” “Industry,” “Business” and in other sections. In some cases, these forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as the words “believe,”
“could,”“estimate,”“anticipate,”“expect,”“intend,”“may,”“will,”“plan,”“continue,”“ongoing,”“potential,”
“predict,” “project,” “target,” “seek,” “should” or “would” or, in each case, their negative or other variations
or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies, plans, objectives, targets, goals, future events or
intentions. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They may appear
in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and may include statements regarding our
intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among others, our results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and dividend policy and the industry in which we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. These factors include, among others:

- the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic;

- general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations
and customers;

- the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace (as defined herein);

- our dependency on a limited number of vendors;

- our vulnerability to declines in demand for new or used vehicles;

- a general decline in vehicle ownership or sudden changes in demand for certain types of used vehicles;

- competition and our ability to successfully adapt to industry changes;

- disruption in supply chains for our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division;

- our dependency on certain information and technology systems, the risk of failure to effectively maintain,
protect, develop or update these systems and the risk of cyber security attacks;

- decrease in acceptance of or failure to improve our digital platforms and mobile applications;

- damage to our inventory and vehicles held on behalf of others caused by extreme weather or other events
outside our control;

- complex taxation in multiple jurisdictions, in particular relating to valued-added taxes;

- our ability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives;

- our ability to successfully identify and acquire or integrate future acquisitions into our business;

- our ability to provide financing in order to offer stock funding (trade finance) to registered dealers through
BCA Partner Finance or to repossess the financed vehicles serving as collateral;

- our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;

- the risk of being accused of infringing on the intellectual property of third parties;

- the risk of being adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations, in particular those governing the
trading of used vehicles and the automotive industry in general;

- the risk of unauthorized access to personal data or the processing of personal data in accordance with
applicable data protection laws;

- laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate, some of which are unsettled and still
developing;

- material increases in our costs;


-----

- our reliance on the strength of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand
awareness;

- our ability to effectively communicate with our customers through email and other messages;

- the risk of dissatisfaction with our customer service;

- risks associated with currency fluctuations;

- environmental, health and safety risks;

- our ability to attract and retain skilled technical employees and management personnel;

- our exposure to non-terminable long-term leases;

- the risk of our standardized documents, contracts and terms and conditions to be held invalid;

- risks associated with deficits in our pension schemes and plans;

- risks associated with significant differences in accounting principles such as IFRS 16 and IAS 17;

- the inclusion of certain unaudited adjusted data and other financial information not prepared in accordance
with IFRS in this Offering Memorandum; and

- other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These risks and others described under the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors” are
not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely
affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which
we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor
can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of
risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as
a prediction of actual results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and we do not
intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this Offering
Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

The market and competitive position data in the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Summary,”
“Risk Factors,” “Operating and Financial Review,” “Industry” and “Business” of this Offering Memorandum
are our estimates based on industry publications, and from surveys or studies conducted by third-party
industry data providers that are generally believed to be reliable. However, the accuracy and completeness of
such information is not guaranteed and has not been independently verified. Additionally, industry
publications and such studies generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from
sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy or completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in
some instances the sources do not assume liability for such information. We have obtained certain of the
market and industry data presented in this Offering Memorandum from reports produced by third-party
industry specialists such as IHS, SMMT and Roland Berger. Unless for such reports that are publicly available,
we have obtained consent from them to reproduce certain of their non-public data in this Offering
Memorandum. We cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such data, and we have not
independently verified such market data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining
from making, any investment decision. We do, however, accept responsibility for the correct reproduction of
this information.

In light of the COVID 19 pandemic, the automotive industry in Europe has been adversely affected. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have,
_a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the_
_ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.” Accordingly, the industry publications, surveys or_
studies by third-party data providers referred to in this Offering Memorandum may not accurately reflect
certain aspects of the automotive industry in Europe as they may not contemplate the effects of the COVID
19 pandemic. Conversely, while some of the market or industry forecasts referred to in this Offering
Memorandum take into account the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the automotive industry in
Europe, we cannot assure you that these forecasts will remain relevant, and will not be subject to change, as
the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on the automotive industry become more apparent.

Some of the information herein has been extrapolated from such market data or reports using our experience
and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements regarding the industry in which
we operate and our position in this industry are based solely on our experience, internal studies and estimates,
and our own investigation of market conditions. We believe that such information and statements are true
and accurate, but there can be no assurance that is the case. Such information and statements have not been
verified by any independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding such information,
statements and any similar data presented herein, such information, statements or similar data are subject to
change based on various factors, including those discussed under the section of this Offering Memorandum
entitled “Risk Factors.” As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the
accuracy or completeness of any such information or statements in this Offering Memorandum.

Further, in this Offering Memorandum, we make statements about our market positioning relative to other
companies in the vehicle remarketing business, other vehicle buying companies and other companies providing
automotive services similar to ours. These statements are generally based on our experience and estimates,
and our own evaluation of our competitors in the market. Where we present comparative data of certain of
these peers, we have derived such data from the publicly available information of these companies or industry
publications, surveys or studies by third-party data providers. We cannot guarantee that the comparative peer
data that we present in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared or presented on a comparable basis to
our own key operating information. We also cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such
comparative peer data, and we have not independently verified or reviewed such peer data and such data
should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment decision. Accordingly, the
comparative peer data presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution, as such
information may not be directly comparable to our own key operating information.

**IFRS Financial Information**

**_Audited Financial Information_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have included certain audited financial information of (i) the Parent as of
and for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (the “Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements”),
(ii) the Parent as of and for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 (the “Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated
_Financial Statements”) and (iii) BCA Marketplace as of and for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019_
(the “Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements” and together with the Fiscal Year 2021
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements, the
“Consolidated Financial Statements”). The Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 and the applicable legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Fiscal Year 2020
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretation from the IFRS
Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act
2006 applicable to companies reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards. The Consolidated
Financial Statements have been audited by our independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”),
and are collectively referred to as prepared in accordance with “IFRS.”

Our fiscal year accounting periods typically run from the calendar day following the previous fiscal year end
to a Sunday within seven days of March 31. For the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the relevant Sundays
were March 28, 2021, March 29, 2020 and March 31, 2019. While the Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial
Statements and the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the 52-week period ended
March 28, 2021 (from and including March 30, 2020 to and including March 28, 2021) and the 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019 (from and including April 2, 2018 to and including March 31, 2019), respectively,
the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements only comprise the 42-week period ended March 29,
2020 (from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020). As such, the Fiscal Year 2020
Consolidated Financial Statements are not comparable to the other Consolidated Financial Statements since
they only cover the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, representing the period from the incorporation
date of the Parent on June 10, 2019.

In addition, due to the CA Acquisition, which completed on November 6, 2019, the Fiscal Year 2020
Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect our trading results during the period from April 1, 2019 to
November 5, 2019. Below is an overview of the trading history covered by the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

- The Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of BCA
Marketplace and its subsidiaries from and including April 2, 2018 to and including March 31, 2019.
Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 52 weeks of trading,
reflecting our results of operations prior to the CA Acquisition.

- The Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent and
Constellation Automotive (which were incorporated for the purpose of facilitating the CA Acquisition
and, as such, are holding companies with no operations and no assets other than the shares held) from and
including the date of incorporation of the Parent on June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020.
During the period from June 10, 2019 to the completion date of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019,
the Parent had no activities and had very limited financial results to report. Following the consummation


-----

of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019, our financial results are consolidated at the Parent level.
Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 145 days of trading,
reflecting our results of operations after the CA Acquisition.

- The Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent
group from and including March 30, 2020 to and including March 28, 2021. Accordingly, the Fiscal Year
2021 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 52 weeks of trading.

_Application of IFRS 16_

IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full fiscal year commencing on
or after that date. Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 since the fiscal year 2020. We have adopted IFRS 16
under the modified retrospective approach on April 1, 2019, with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16
recognized on adoption as an adjustment to opening equity. Under this approach, comparative information
for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have
been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020
Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not be
comparable insofar as they relate to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases).

Following the CA Acquisition, a purchase price allocation exercise was undertaken in order to identify the
fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired thereunder, in line with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations).
IFRS 3 requires the revaluation of IFRS 16 right of use assets and lease liabilities using a revised incremental
borrowing rate (“IBR”). The IBR we used for these purposes increased significantly following the CA
Acquisition as a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection therewith. Due to the significant change in
IBR used for the valuation of right of use assets and lease liabilities resulting from the CA Acquisition, the
full year IFRS 16 depreciation and interest included in our Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information
represents the aggregation of (i) the pre-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and interest calculated with
reference to the original, pre-CA Acquisition IBR and (ii) the post-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and
interest calculated with reference to the revised, post-CA Acquisition IBR. Accordingly, the financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
2020 Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not
be comparable.

**_Unaudited Financial Information_**

Due to the limited period covered by the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements described above,
we also include in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited consolidated financial information of BCA
Marketplace and its subsidiaries as of and for the 219-day period from and including April 1, 2019 to and
including November 5, 2019 (together with comparative consolidated financial information as of and for the
210 day period from and including April 2, 2018 to and including October 28, 2018, the “2020 Predecessor
_Financial Statements”). The 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with_
International Accounting Standard No. 34 (“IAS 34”), the standard of IFRS applicable to interim financial
statements.

**_Unaudited Aggregated Financial Information for the 52-week Period Ended March 29, 2020_**

In addition, we have included certain unaudited aggregated financial information for the 52-week period
ended March 29, 2020, which is derived by adding together the unaudited consolidated income statement
information of BCA Marketplace for the 219-day period from and including April 1, 2019 to and including
November 5, 2019 and the consolidated income statement information of the Parent for the 42-week period
from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020 (which includes the 145-day post-CA
Acquisition trading result from November 6, 2019 up to and including March 29, 2020) (the “Fiscal Year 2020
_Aggregated Financial Information”). The financial information used in presenting the Fiscal Year 2020_
Aggregated Financial Information includes information for the Parent from June 10, 2019 (the date of
incorporation of the Parent), which overlaps with information of BCA Marketplace from April 1, 2019.
However, the Parent was formed on June 10, 2019 for the purposes of facilitating the CA Acquisition, which
was consummated on November 6, 2019, and the Parent did not trade prior to November 6, 2019. Moreover,
while both the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2020 Predecessor Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, they relate to different entities that have not prepared
their financial information on a consistent basis. In particular, the discount rates applied in calculating the
IFRS 16 related balances at original transition for the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements differ compared


-----

to those used to calculate the IFRS 16 related balances following the CA Acquisition for the Fiscal Year 2020
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information is included for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our income statement would have been if
the CA Acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2019 and is not intended to project our consolidated results of
operations for any future period. The Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information has not been
prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting principles
or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards.

**_Unaudited Financial Information for the 53-week Period ended May 30, 2021_**

In addition, we have included certain unaudited financial information for the 53-week period ended May 30,
2021. Such information is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to project our consolidated results
of operations for any future period. The 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 has not been audited, reviewed
or verified and you should not place undue reliance thereon. Accordingly, PwC do not express an opinion or
any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The auditor reports included in this Offering Memorandum
relate to the previously issued financial statements of the Parent and BCA Marketplace. It does not extend to
the preliminary financial results and should not be read to do so. Since certain of the unaudited financial
information for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 included in this Offering Memorandum constitute
non-IFRS financial measures, these are subject to important limitations. Please also see “—Non-IFRS
_Financial and Other Information—General.”_

**_Financial Information of the Issuer_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have not included separate financial information for the Issuer. The Issuer
was incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on June 29, 2021, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Parent, to facilitate the offering of the Notes. The Issuer has no business operations or material assets and,
following the Offering, will have no business operations or material assets, other than its rights under the
Proceeds Loan Agreement.

**_General_**

The results of operations for prior fiscal years may not be necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for any future period. In addition, the preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires
the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires us to exercise judgement in the process of
applying our accounting policies. Aspects involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where the
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial information, are disclosed, to the
extent applicable, in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. See also “Operating and Financial Review.”

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared by different entities at different times in accordance
with the respective accounting policies applicable at such time. See also “—Audited Financial Information.”
Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements should be read with reference to the relevant accounting
policies in effect at the relevant time.

We have not included financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in this Offering
Memorandum. IFRS differs in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. In making an investment
decision, you should rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering and the financial
information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for
an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, and how those differences could affect
the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

**Unaudited IAS 17 Financial Information**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have included certain unaudited financial information prepared in
accordance with IAS 17 (Leases), which is an accounting standard that was superseded by IFRS 16. While we
have adopted IFRS 16 since April 1, 2019 (see “—IFRS Financial Information—Application of IFRS 16”), we
have included certain financial information in accordance with the previous accounting standard IAS 17
because we believe that it will enable investors to better compare our underlying operating and financial
performance over the period under review. In particular, the following non-IFRS financial measures are
presented on an IAS 17 basis: IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Pro
Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion, COVID
Adjusted Operating Cash Flow and COVID Adjusted Cash Conversion. Since these non-IFRS financial


-----

measures are subject to important limitations, please see “—Non-IFRS Financial and Other Information—
_General.” In particular, such unaudited financial information prepared in accordance with IAS 17 (Leases)_
has not been audited and it is not comparable to the audited results due to adjustments and should not be
regarded as a substitute for the audited consolidated financial data of the Parent or financial data prepared in
accordance with IFRS.

**Non-IFRS Financial and Other Information**

In addition to IFRS financial information, we have included in this Offering Memorandum certain non-IFRS
measures, key performance indicators and adjusted data reflecting the Refinancing Transactions that we use
to evaluate our financial and operating performance. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other
_Information”and “Risk Factors—Certain adjusted, estimated and calculated consolidated financial information_
_included in this Offering Memorandum is presented for illustrative purposes only and our actual results of_
_operations may differ.”_

incremental impact of current run rate B2B Vehicle Volume, incremental impact of current run rate B2B
Profitability Per Vehicle, incremental impact of current run rate Automotive Services EBITDA and rates

_Other Information.”_

**_Adjusted Data Reflecting the Refinancing Transactions_**

We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, which gives effect to the
Refinancing Transactions, as if it had occurred on March 30, 2020. Such summary unaudited adjusted
consolidated financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to
represent what the actual consolidated financial position or financial information of the CA Group would
have been had the Refinancing Transactions actually occurred on March 30, 2020, nor does such summary
unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information purport to project the CA Group’s consolidated
financial position and financial information at any future date or for any future period. The unaudited
adjusted data presented in this Offering Memorandum includes non-IFRS measures and is based on available
information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially
from the actual amounts. The adjusted data reflecting the Refinancing Transactions refers to the following
measures:

- “Adjusted Cash”means cash and cash equivalents, as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing Transactions;

- “Adjusted Total Senior Secured Debt”means bank borrowings (excluding our finance leases), as adjusted to

Adjusted Total Debt.

For more information on the additional data, see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other
_Information.”_

**_General_**

The non-IFRS measures and other information included in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared
for information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other
internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable
auditing standards. These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting
measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our
performance.

The non-IFRS measures and other information, including Reported Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Adjusted
EBITDA, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA, Underlying
Cash CAPEX, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion, COVID Adjusted Operating Cash
Flow, COVID Adjusted Cash Conversion, Adjusted Cash, Adjusted Total Senior Secured Debt, Adjusted
Net Senior Secured Debt, Adjusted Total Debt, Adjusted Net Debt, Adjusted Cash Interest Expense and
similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that
reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing Reported Adjusted
EBITDA, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run
Rate EBITDA, Underlying Cash CAPEX, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion,
COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, COVID Adjusted Cash Conversion, Adjusted Cash, Adjusted Total
Senior Secured Debt, Adjusted Net Senior Secured Debt, Adjusted Total Debt, Adjusted Net Debt, Adjusted

reported by other companies. Reported Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 COVID
Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA, Underlying Cash CAPEX, Adjusted

-----

Adjusted Total Debt, Adjusted Net Debt, Adjusted Cash Interest Expense have limitations as analytical tools,
and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported
under IFRS. Because of these limitations, these non-IFRS measures and other information should not be
considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of our business or as measures
of cash that will be available to meet our obligations, including our obligations under the Notes. You should
compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures
and other information only supplementally to evaluate our performance. You should exercise caution when
evaluating each of the adjustments reflected in our presentation of the non-IFRS measures and other
information and whether you consider each to be appropriate as this information is inherently subject to risks
and uncertainties.

We have included the non-IFRS measures and other information (i) as they are used by us to monitor and
report to the board on financial position and (ii) to present similar measures that are widely used by certain
investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of financial position,
financial performance and liquidity. We believe these non-IFRS measures and other information enhance the
investor’s understanding of our indebtedness and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital
expenditures and meet and service our obligations, including our obligations under the Notes.

The non-IFRS measures and other information are based on available information and certain assumptions
and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates
are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may
differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and
other information included in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting
requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC and certain measures would be
prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the SEC. Certain of these amounts have not
been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm.

The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of
the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None of the adjustments, estimates or
run rate calculations have been audited by any independent auditors and should not be considered indicative
of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment,
estimate or calculation been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future
consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those
presented for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used.

**Overview**

We operate leading digital used vehicle marketplaces (both business to business (“B2B”) and consumer to
business (“C2B”)) in the UK and B2B marketplaces in continental Europe and are a leading provider of
associated automotive services, including vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet
management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. We have physical presence in 10 countries
across the UK and continental Europe as well as unmatched sourcing, data, technology and logistics
capabilities. As of March 28, 2021, our business comprises:

- a leading B2B digital used vehicle marketplace across the UK and continental Europe, which facilitated the
sale of approximately 1.5 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 1.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year
2021;

- a leading C2B digital used vehicle marketplace in the UK, WeBuyAnyCar, with sold volumes of 321,000
vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, reflecting the COVID 19
restrictions on the business that now has an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in
March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period); and

- a leading automotive logistics service business in the UK, which moved more than 2.8 million vehicles in
the UK in the fiscal year 2020 and 2.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021, and stored, refurbished and
processed more than 950,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 675,000 in the fiscal year 2021.

We estimate that for the fiscal year 2020 we came in contact with approximately one in every three vehicles in
the UK (approximately 29 million touch points, of which approximately 13 million were unique vehicles out
of a vehicle parc of approximately 41 million, and including approximately 24 million digital touch points).
Through our digital used vehicle marketplaces (the “Marketplace”), we are a critical liquidity provider to the
used vehicles market across the UK and continental Europe, matching the complex requirements of both
vendors and buyers and also facilitating the purchase of individual vehicles from consumers. The Marketplace
facilitates speedy disposal of high volumes of vehicles and offers a broad range of consistently graded vehicle
stock, thereby providing efficiency, liquidity (i.e., fast disposal of vehicle stock) and choice. Moreover, we are
the UK’s leading provider of automotive services solutions.

By providing a full suite of auction and automotive services, we offer our customers solutions for almost all
stages of the vehicle life-cycle, beginning as soon as the new car arrives at the port. Our scope of services
provides synergistic benefits across our divisions, as our vehicle sales platforms, together with our automotive
services solutions, generate vehicle and pricing data used in both our vehicle remarketing and vehicle buying
operations.

Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, we have accelerated our digital transition and now transact digitally
almost 100% of our volumes through online channels. We integrate our digital and physical assets to provide
innovative multi-service solutions, maximizing speed, intelligence and performance across our comprehensive
offerings. In the fiscal year 2021, 100% (2020: 37%) of our auction volumes in the UK Vehicle Remarketing
division and 96% (2020: 84%) of our auction volumes in the International Vehicle Remarketing division were
transacted online, which is a testament to our successful shift towards a predominantly digital online business
model moving forward.

In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, we generated £253.1 million of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA,
as compared to £232.8 million, £204.1 million and £174.4 million in the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019,
respectively.

We operate through three main business lines: (i) the B2B Marketplace business line, which is comprised of
our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying
division’s operations in continental Europe, (ii) the C2B Marketplace business line, which is WeBuyAnyCar,
our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, and (iii) the Automotive Services business line, which is
accounted for in our Automotive Services division.


-----

- B2B Marketplace: B2B Marketplace is our core business that facilitates the exchange of used vehicles
between vendors and buyers through primarily digital auctions. As of March 28, 2021, our digital auctions
are supported by 21 physical sites in the UK (23 as of June 1, 2021) and 30 physical sites in continental
Europe at which vehicles are stored, inspected, repaired and refurbished.

B2B Marketplace (which excludes WeBuyAnyCar) does not take title to the majority of vehicles that it sells,
but instead serves as an agent between vendor and buyer and recognizes revenues through auction transaction
fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical pre- and post- auction services such as
inspections, appraisals, repairs, refurbishment, imaging, storage and handling. We also purchase vehicles
directly from certain corporate vendors under outsourced remarketing contracts, whereby we directly buy our
vendors’ inventory and have discretion over the remarketing channel through which we sell the vehicle. B2B
Marketplace takes title to such vehicles until the time of resale and recognizes revenues for the full sale value
of the vehicle less the cost of acquisition. Vehicles acquired pursuant to outsourced remarketing contracts are
typically resold within 15 to 30 days of acquisition and in turn generate additional revenue above the auction
fees.

B2B Marketplace also includes our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, which is
focused on purchasing batches of vehicles primarily from corporates in continental Europe.

In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division generated £90.5 million
of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £116.3 million; 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019: £109.4 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division
sold approximately 867,000 vehicles (2020: 1,063,000 vehicles; 2019: 1,030,0000 vehicles). In the 52-week
period ended March 28, 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division generated £29.2 million of IAS
17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £34.2 million; 52-week period ended
March 31, 2019: £33.7 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division sold
approximately 334,000 vehicles (2020: 401,000 vehicles; 2019: 388,000 vehicles).

- C2B Marketplace: C2B Marketplace is our C2B vehicle buying business which operates in the UK through
WeBuyAnyCar. WeBuyAnyCar purchases used vehicles directly from consumers, leveraging its proprietary
online pricing quotation systems and efficient physical inspection processes to facilitate purchases from
such consumers. WeBuyAnyCar has carried out a total of 2.2 million vehicle purchases since its inception
in 2006, and in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar recorded more than 22 million unique
visitors to its website and performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online. As of March 28, 2021,
WeBuyAnyCar operates in 357 locations across the UK, which are located within an average drive time of
under 14 minutes to customers. In addition, WeBuyAnyCar offers swift services to its consumers, allowing
them to obtain a quote in under 60 seconds and to then subsequently receive monies for the purchase of
their vehicle within 30 minutes of the sale being concluded.

C2B Marketplace remarkets the vehicles it purchases exclusively through B2B Marketplace within
approximately 10 days and accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division in
the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This allows us to actively manage the volumes and mix on the
Marketplace, while helping to de-risk the supply of vehicles to the auction.

C2B Marketplace’s consistent and growing profitability over the past years demonstrates our ability to
generate “metal margin” (accounted for in our Vehicle Buying division) on C2B vehicles in addition to core
auction buyer fees (accounted for in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division). Vehicles sourced via our C2B
Marketplace therefore result in higher profitability per vehicle for the CA Group. Our sophisticated and
proprietary pricing mechanism and real-time market data enable us to more accurately price the purchase of
vehicles to generate a profitable onward sale. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Vehicle Buying
division generated £44.0 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29,
2020: £27.7 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £24.1 million), which was predominantly generated
through C2B Marketplace (i.e., WeBuyAnyCar).

- Automotive Services: Automotive Services provides vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery
inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. With our refurbishment
offering (which has a 250,000 yearly vehicle refurbishment capacity), we are able to bring vehicles to either
wholesale standard or a “Retail Ready” standard (which refers to vehicles that are cosmetically and
mechanically prepared to be immediately placed for sale to end consumers and are therefore particularly
attractive to online car dealers). These standards increase prices achieved at auction and render it simpler
for dealers to on-sell the vehicle to consumers. We seek to develop a relationship with vendors and endeavor
to act as a one-stop shop for vehicles throughout the majority of their lifecycle, expanding our revenue


-----

streams along the value chain and also positioning ourselves to be the preferred provider of remarketing
services when the vehicles come off lease or roll out of the fleet. Our overall infrastructure and logistics
network allow us to efficiently cover all key locations and major transport hubs in the UK. Automotive
Services helps maximize the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies derived from the
wide-ranging scope of services offered, benefitting both our customers as well as our own operations.

Automotive Services generates revenue in the form of service fees. In the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, Automotive Services generated £12.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period
ended March 29, 2020: £22.6 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £19.1 million).

**Our Strengths**

We believe that, by virtue of the key strengths described below, we are well-positioned to benefit from
structurally favorable trends in the used vehicle market.

**_Leadership across Markets_**

We are a leading operator of digital used vehicle auctions in the UK and continental Europe and associated
automotive services across the UK. From continental Europe, we serve over 40 countries, leveraging our
ability to engage in cross-border activity across continental Europe. We believe our leading market positioning
and scale enable us to better serve used car buyers and sellers compared to many of our competitors as we are
able to price, source, inspect, refurbish, transport, service, market, arrange auctions and provide digital and
physical services and solutions in an efficient, comprehensive and effective way.

We believe our B2B Marketplace is the largest used vehicle auction operator across the UK and continental
Europe combined, with approximately £10 billion in gross merchandise value in connection with sales for the
fiscal year 2020. We believe that B2B Marketplace is the clear leader in the UK, having sold approximately
1.1 million vehicles in the UK in the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, as well as
approximately 400,000 vehicles sold in continental Europe in the same period. These attributes mean that we
can continuously meet the requirements of both professional vendors and buyers, including improved value,
liquidity, efficiency and choice, and are a key part of the reason that more than 25,000 active buyers used the
exchange in the fiscal year 2021. Through our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our Automotive Services
offering in the UK and our brand WeBuyAnyCar, we come into contact with approximately one third of all
vehicles exchanged in the UK each year.

We believe that C2B Marketplace, through our brand WeBuyAnyCar, is the leading vehicle buying service in
the UK, purchasing and selling over 321,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020. On an annualized basis based on
trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period, we purchased and
sold approximately 461,000 vehicles through WeBuyAnyCar. With greater than 22 million unique visitors to
its website in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021 and having performed approximately 15.6 million valuations
online and purchasing vehicles at 357 physical sites, each as of and for the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, we believe that C2B Marketplace is significantly larger and has a significantly greater presence than any
other vehicle buying service in the UK. C2B Marketplace’s leadership position is continuing to strengthen
with an increase in the number of repeat customers in recent years, demonstrating consumers’ trust in the
brand and satisfaction around the value attached to the vehicle disposal process. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, WeBuyAnyCar has over 100,000 Trust Pilot reviews with an average 4.6 rating.

In Automotive Services, we operate one of the largest automotive vehicle movement, logistics, storage, predelivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment capability in the UK. As of
March 28, 2021, we own the largest transporter fleet in the UK, comprising 901 trucks capable of providing
bulk vehicle movements, thereby connecting the physical marketplace and increasing the integration between
our divisions. We also offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through
the process of vehicle delivery, handover and collection. In the fiscal year 2021, we moved 2.4 million vehicles
(2020: 2.8 million), including 563,000 single vehicle movements, and our in-house and sub-contracted
transporter fleet completed 94% of transport arranged for customers by the UK Vehicle Remarketing division.
We offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through the process of
vehicle delivery, handover and collection.

We also operate one of the UK’s largest inspect and collect businesses with over 400,000 vehicle inspections
made in the fiscal year 2021, are one of the UK’s leading new vehicle storage handling and preparation
businesses and are among the UK’s leading de-fleet, refurbishment and alloy wheel businesses with more than
675,000 vehicles stored, refurbished and processed in the fiscal year 2021.


-----

**_Superior Business Model Addressing the Full Value Chain and Difficult to Replicate_**

We operate under a marketplace model and benefit from self-reinforcing dynamics where each of our business
lines feeds into and reinforces the others. Our business model enables us to extract intragroup efficiencies and
synergies derived from operating across almost all stages of the vehicle life-cycle, at high volumes sufficient to
provide a level of information, liquidity and market recognition that drives further volume growth.

Our B2B Marketplace operates vehicle auctions that bring together vendors with a highly fragmented and
diverse buyer base. Our large, robust and transparent digital platforms combined with our full suite of preand post-auction digital and physical value-added services provide an efficient marketplace to facilitate the
exchange of used vehicles. B2B Marketplace sold approximately 1.5 million vehicles across the UK and
continental Europe in the fiscal year 2020. This significant scale creates a virtuous business cycle by providing
access to a wide variety and large volume of vehicles through our auctions, thereby attracting more buyers to
our platform and enabling optimum pricing and quick throughput, which in turn attracts more sellers and
provides more volumes. Moreover, we obtain valuable insights for our pricing engines based on the
information we have available about a vehicle and its condition, color, auction sale price and bid levels. The
B2B Marketplace benefits from multiple sourcing channels targeting different types of vendors.

The C2B Marketplace creates a highly complementary and enhancing growth engine to that of the B2B
Marketplace. The B2B Marketplace provides WeBuyAnyCar with a highly efficient route to dispose of the
vehicles it purchases from consumers (typically within 10 days) and, through WeBuyAnyCar, we have the
ability to purchase a greater volume and variety of vehicles, which directly helps supply the B2B Marketplace.
The Vehicle Buying division provides significant volumes to the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, having
accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold through the Marketplace in the UK in the fiscal year 2021. This
synergistic model, which leverages WeBuyAnyCar’s market share within the framework of our wider
marketplace, creates a platform which we believe would be difficult to replicate.

Our ability to dynamically source used vehicles combined with our knowledge and insights on pricing and
other demand side dynamics enable us to find an optimum and tailored match for buyers and sellers swiftly,
which is key in driving profitability per vehicle. This is further strengthened by the additional services we offer,
which increase consumer and vendor experience as well as help us generate greater profitability per vehicle.

Our scaled B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace provides our pricing model with over six million relevant
historic used vehicle transactions. This data enables us to accurately and efficiently price vehicles both upon
sourcing and sale. This scale is further supported by our Automotive Services business line and our full suite
of pre- and post-auction digital and physical value-added services. This completes the value chain allowing us
to cover the full life-cycle, deepen relationships with vendors and customers and maximize profitability per
vehicle. Moreover, our Automotive Services business line and our value-added services enable us to record
information relating to vehicle condition, maintenance and upkeep, further contributing to the pricing model
and further supporting the reliability of pricing decisions.

With the launch of B2C Marketplace, outside the restricted group, we have further diversified our buyer and
vendor base as cinch acts as another buyer through our auction channel, thereby generating auction fees for
our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as additional income for our Automotive Services division.
Furthermore, cinch also generates additional supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that
are remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.”_


-----

As the scale of each of the business lines has grown and has reached greater volumes and touch points, it has
contributed to the further growth of each of the business lines in a virtuous cycle. We believe we are the only
operator of digital used vehicle auctions in the UK and continental Europe that offers the scale and the range
of services we provide. Our advantages in scale, reputation, relationships, access to proprietary data as well as
our established infrastructure and logistics network, which we believe would be difficult for a competitor to
replicate.

**_Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation_**

We believe that our scale, unique business model, reputation and robust financial policies have contributed
significantly to our long-term financial resilience, attractive growth and cash flow generation profile. Despite
turbulent times such as the global financial crisis of 2008, we were able to consistently maintain and grow
volumes and our EBITDA metric (as defined and prepared on the basis of the accounting policies of the
relevant parent entity at the time), with such metric having grown at a CAGR of 14.3% from the fiscal year
ended December 2004 to fiscal year ended March 2020 and such metric divided by vehicle volumes sold in the
respective trading year having grown from £37 per vehicle sold to £137 per vehicle sold over the same period,
as shown in the following chart.

Our business model’s resilience to market shocks can be further evidenced by our strong organic performance.
For example, during the period between 2008 and 2010, we were able to grow volumes by 66,000 vehicles and
the applicable EBITDA metric by £24 million in a market backdrop of reduced used car transactions in the
UK, which fell from 8.3 million in 2008 to 8.0 million in 2009 before recovering to 8.1 million in 2010. Despite
a market backdrop of reduced used vehicle transactions during the fiscal year 2021, our volumes between
July 2020 and December 2020 were higher compared to the period between July 2019 and December 2019. In
times of a consumer downturn and due to rate of loss in value generally associated with used vehicles, liquidity
is of paramount importance to businesses as well as consumers.

Our business is also highly cash generative, having generated £145.9 million, £175.1 million and £202.7 million
of COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week
period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively. This strong cash
generation is the result of our ability to grow our IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA while following a
disciplined approach to capital expenditure with the majority of sites being held on long term leases (excluding
WeBuyAnyCar retail locations) and most of our transporters and properties being refinanced through sale
and leaseback. Adjusted cash conversion (measured by subtracting Underlying Cash CAPEX from IAS 17
COVID Adjusted EBITDA and comparing the result to IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA) was 84%, 86%
and 87% in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively.

**_Attractive, Resilient and Underpenetrated Market_**

We operate in the used vehicle market across the UK and continental Europe which has grown consistently
since 2012, driven by a relatively stable vehicle parc churn and growing vehicle penetration rates. Vehicle


-----

penetration rates are expected to continue to grow for most markets. In addition, the used car market is larger
and more stable than the new car market. The chart below sets out the volumes of used car sales and new car
sales in the UK between 2008 and 2020 as an example of the development of these market.

The European vehicle parc has exhibited a CAGR of approximately 1.7% over 2012 to 2019, currently
standing at approximately 320 million units as of 2020. As per projections from IHS, the European vehicle
parc is expected to exhibit approximately 0.8% CAGR over 2021 to 2026, driven by growth in the penetration
of vehicles per population. Assuming churn rates remain the same, this should support growth in the used car
market. See “Industry—Overview—UK and Continental European Vehicle Parc.”

In 2020, the European used car market was estimated to be worth €410 billion (Source: Roland Berger report
_(Apr-21)). Significant fragmentation of buyers and vendors across the UK and continental Europe helps to_
make exchanges a critical channel for both vendors and buyers. For example, the largest used car dealership in
the UK is limited to approximately 3% market share, while the largest continental European used car
dealership has a market share of less than 1% (Source: IHS and ICDP). In addition, online vehicle buying
services are still operating typically at low levels of overall market penetration (e.g., WeBuyAnyCar has ~4%
share of total UK used vehicle sales volumes, as of 2020).

The COVID 19 pandemic has also accelerated favorable structural trends affecting the markets in which we
operate. In particular, consumers have recently begun placing increased emphasis on the importance of
owning a car. This has been driven by a variety of different reasons, including people moving away from
urban areas due to the ability to work from home and a reluctance to rely entirely on public transport. In
addition, the lockdown measures imposed by governments and related closure of car dealerships has made
digital channels a principal means of conducting used car auctions. In particular, by the start of 2021 almost
all of our auctions were digital as the COVID 19 pandemic and related social distancing regulations accelerated
our digitalization plans and encouraged the adoption of digital auctions by our customers. This digital shift
allows us to reach a wider range of potential customers and has increased the amount of auctions being held,
reducing our daily sales’ costs and allowing us and our customers to receive more vehicle data. Finally, we also
benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push towards new technology,
including tighter emission controls, encourages vehicle owners to renew their vehicles, driving more exchanges.

**_Best-in-class Management Team with Successful Track Record of Delivery_**

We operate with a management team that has significant experience in the automotive sector and has a proven
track-record of executing value-accretive initiatives, whether organically or through acquisitions. Our
Executive Chairman, Avril Palmer-Baunack, has over 25 years’ executive experience with leading businesses
in the automotive, support services, industrial engineering and insurance services sectors, having previously
served as Executive Chairman and Deputy CEO of Stobart Group and CEO of Autologic Holdings, where
she joined from Universal Salvage and also held the position of CEO. Avril was the founder of Haversham
Holdings plc in 2014 and led the acquisition and strategic build of the CA Group where she continues to lead
as Executive Chairman. Tim Lampert, our Chief Financial Officer, joined Autologic Holdings in 1997. Tim
joined Haversham Holdings plc in January 2015 for the purchase of the BCA Group from CD&R and the
subsequent acquisitions prior to the group being de-listed and sold to TDR in November 2019 and has
remained as CFO with the formation of the current CA Group. Together, our best-in-class management team
brings over 30 years of relationships with major participants across every layer of the UK and continental
European automotive sector both at the division and group levels, and more than 100 years of collective
experience in the industry across four managing directors as well as legacy knowledge from some of our
founders, who are still employed within our Vehicle Buying division.

Thanks to its extensive experience, our management team has a proven track record of delivery, with
applicable EBITDA growing from £86.0 million in the fiscal year 2014 to £200.8 million in the fiscal year 2020


-----

(as presented under “—Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation”) through, among others,
the acquisition of multiple infrastructure and logistics businesses. During the same period, B2B Vehicle
Volume increased from 999,000 to 1,463,000. Since the fiscal year 2014, C2B Vehicle Volume also increased
from 144,000 to 321,000 vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, with an
annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most
recent three-month period), reflecting the COVID 19 restrictions on the business.

The track record of our senior management in delivering cost-effective organic scale growth and successfully
integrating acquisitions, is one of our key strengths in a complex and continually evolving industry. In
addition, our management is backed by TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm with an integrated
investment and operation team of 46 professionals with an average of 15 years of relevant experience and a
deep knowledge and track-record in the automotive industry via investments in LeasePlan, CarNext,
EuroGarages and International Car Washing Group. The TDR Capital team, together with management,
intends to continue our trajectory of consistent volume and profitability growth.

We have also created a strong culture of innovation and transparency, winning a number of industry awards
for technical innovation, including for BCA Dealer Pro and our website. We believe this has allowed us to
maintain a high retention rate of key staff and develop a workforce that is dedicated to delivering high-quality
services.

**_Platform Ideally Positioned for Growth_**

We believe our business platform is strategically positioned for growth in our markets through market share
gain from the consumer to consumer (“C2C”) and part-exchange markets (whereby consumers “trade-in”
their used vehicle directly to a dealer). The growth of C2B Marketplace supports the growth of our B2B
channel as WeBuyAnyCar provides us with used vehicles that would otherwise go to C2C markets or partexchanges and allows us to supply a greater volume and variety of vehicles to our B2B Marketplace.

We believe we can drive higher volumes through our auctions through continued market share gain and
higher auction penetration in the UK and continental Europe. Our relationships with businesses such as
LeasePlan or CarNext, including entering into exclusive service agreements that provide support for our
multi-channel strategy, further enhance our sourcing capabilities and drive growth in the vehicle remarketing
segment. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with LeasePlan.”Moreover,
by leveraging our “One Europe” strategy via more seamless cross-border transactions, we believe we can
create a truly pan-European B2B marketplace for future growth.

In addition, COVID 19 restrictions have accelerated consumers’ willingness to adopt digital purchasing as a
means to buy a car from current low levels, favoring the growth of online B2C retailers, such as cinch. Our
relationship with cinch has increased supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that are
remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Through cinch, we are also able to develop a B2C channel,_
which enhances our position as an end-to-end service provider. In particular, sales volumes for the B2C
channel increased from approximately 4,000 in October 2020 (based on a 7-day rolling annual run-rate) to
approximately 38,000 in May 2021.

**Our Strategies**

We seek to create value for stakeholders through organic growth, acquisitions and partnerships in the
automotive sector in the UK and continental Europe. We continue to work with major market participants to
develop and adapt integrated solutions to solve and meet the needs of the participants across the automotive
sector, maximizing value for all stakeholders. To achieve this goal, we are focused on enhancing our competitive
advantage as an integrated end-to-end service provider, further expanding internationally, strengthening our
infrastructure and logistics network, capitalizing on favorable industry trends, continuing to enhance our data
capabilities and improving our operational efficiencies, cash flow and leverage.

**_Enhance our competitive advantage across the value chain as an integrated end-to-end service provider_**

We plan to drive growth by increasing our B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace penetration to increase
transaction volumes and scale across our geographies. The increase in scale will serve to provide even deeper
access to vehicles, as well as more pricing and vehicle information, and is expected to continue to solidify our
position as a leading operator of digital used vehicle auctions across the UK and the continental European
countries in which we operate. We also expect to continue leveraging upon and investing in our UK and
continental European network and infrastructure.


-----

To further increase our scale, we intend to deepen our relationships with other participants in the used vehicle
ecosystem, including OEMs, leasing companies, finance companies and dealers, to improve access to used
vehicle supply and generate volumes. We plan to provide dealers with additional offerings that suit their
business models, to leverage the strength of WeBuyAnyCar’s brand to capture additional supply volumes as
consumers become increasingly willing to sell their vehicles through digital channels, and expand our reach to
serve customers through partnerships with other B2C platforms.

In order to maintain our competitive advantage across the value chain, we will leverage the close relationship
between our C2B Marketplace and B2B Marketplace and work on integrating further the insights and data
points we are able to collect at different stages, further supplemented by our data sharing agreement with
cinch. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Multiplying our
data touchpoints for vehicles entering our ecosystem will enable us to base our decisions on more precise and
efficient processes and pricing input.

We intend to continue to develop both our digital and physical service offerings to retain and grow the
customer base and deliver enhanced profitability. By increasing the penetration of value-added services over
time, we expect a compounding effect of fueling Marketplace growth by driving supply and buyer demand, as
the comprehensive end-to-end solutions significantly enhance user loyalty.

We also intend to further deepen the penetration of services provided by Automotive Services to continue to
improve relationships with vendors, both to provide additional vehicle information to benefit our other
divisions and to become the preferred choice for vehicle remarketing.

**_Further deliver on our international expansion strategy_**

We believe we are well positioned in Europe to become a truly pan-European leader in the used vehicle auction
market. Our “One Europe” strategy is focused on leveraging and optimizing our already existing capabilities
to provide more seamless cross-border transactions not only in countries where we have physical presence but
across the European continent. In continental Europe, which we believe is underpenetrated relative to more
developed markets such as the UK, we intend to grow our B2B Marketplace offering as well as our coordinated
logistics network and infrastructure to capture further market share and develop scale.

**_Strengthening our infrastructure and logistics network_**

As we look to increase our scale and continue to capture more volumes via our platforms, we will continue to
invest and strengthen our infrastructure and logistics capabilities in order to serve customers across the value
chain, while remaining asset light through the continued use of sale and leaseback transactions. We also
intend to develop and modernize our transport vehicles used for vehicle movement. Our aim is to remain a
major component of the UK used vehicle market backbone and extend this know-how to our other
geographies.

**_Capitalize on favorable structural industry trends to accelerate our growth_**

Online penetration for sales of used vehicles has grown significantly, particularly in the UK, in recent years
and the associated structural trends further accelerated during the COVID 19 pandemic. During the
COVID 19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in online penetration for sales of used vehicles, as
physical venues were shut for lockdown periods and social distancing restrictions and health concerns
otherwise caused many consumers to avoid physical venues. Despite the recent acceleration in online
penetration growth, we believe the online used car market remains underpenetrated relative to other mass
retail markets such as markets for toys and games, consumer electronics and apparel.

Further enhancing our digital presence will also allow us to capitalize on additional structural trends that
could drive more volumes through our Marketplace and strengthen our positioning and market share on
both the supply and demand sides of the ecosystem. In particular, we believe that on the demand side
consumers will continue to favor used vehicles for individual transportation to avoid public transportation
systems, and that more vehicles will be necessary as consumers move away from city centers to areas where
public transportation is inconvenient or unavailable. On the demand side, we look to attract wider audiences
via our digital auctions with no limitations linked to historical physical sites.

Finally, we will seek to benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push
towards new technology, including towards electric and other alternative fuel sources for vehicles, encourages
vehicle owners to review their vehicles, driving more exchanges.


-----

**_Continue to enhance our data capabilities_**

Our business model is built on leveraging data and technology and we intend to continue to invest in our IT
infrastructure and data capabilities to scale up along with volume growth. We use data and technology
throughout our business, from providing instant price quotes and targeted marketing campaigns to valuation
tools, logistics and inventory management to optimization of refurbishment costs.

Through our end-to-end positioning we have access to one of the largest pools of real-time data.

As such, we are invested in ensuring that our IT infrastructure remains state-of-the-art to secure better
knowledge of our customers and their needs, which in turn is expected to enable us to develop better products
and more tailored service as well as more accurate pricing which is expected to help underpin our profitability.

**_Increase our operational efficiencies and drive strong cash flow and deleveraging_**

As we look to increase volumes flowing through our Marketplace, we believe we will have an opportunity to
improve our profitability per vehicle. Driving continued penetration of automotive services will help maximize
the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies. Enhancing our data capabilities will allow us to
optimize pricing, leading to better unit economics, while we also look to ensure an optimal management of
our inventories to ensure a strong cash flow conversion at all times.

To support our strong cash generation, we will maintain our disciplined approach to cost management, which
proved to be effective in helping us navigate through the COVID 19 pandemic and its associated challenges,
maintaining an optimal capital structure and strong deleveraging profile while continuing in investing to grow
the business.

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

Based on our preliminary financial results for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, we generated
£253.1 million of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to £232.8 million, £204.1 million and
£174.4 million in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29,
2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively.

_Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Operating and Financial Review” for a discussion of certain of the factors that_
_could affect our performance and results of operations._

**_Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions_**

On April 22, 2021, we made a tactical acquisition of a third-party site in Corby, United Kingdom, for
£12.0 million. On May 12, 2021, we completed the sale of another site in Corby, United Kingdom, for
£23.4 million, having retained a lease with respect to such site and after previously purchasing the site for
£19.7 million.

On May 20, 2021, we acquired Rockingham (RT) Limited, Rockingham (GW) Limited and Rockingham
(CP) Limited for a combined consideration of £80.0 million (the “Rockingham Acquisition”). Through the
Rockingham Acquisition, we expect to be able to increase our specialist automotive reconditioning and
logistics capabilities.

**_Impact of COVID 19_**

Due to the unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers,
leasing companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private
consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace
were significantly reduced during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 with average weekly trading volume
dipping to 4,000 at the start of the quarter, compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year 2020. The changes in operating environment spurred by the COVID 19 pandemic have led us to accelerate
our shift towards a fully digital online business model with increased focus on the functionality and usability
of our digital platforms, as a result of which we were able to earn new contracts and increase our market share
in spite of the challenging market conditions. The scale of the transformation is demonstrated by the fiscal
year 2021 ending with 100% of UK auction sales having occurred online, compared to 37% in the fiscal year
2020.

In addition to the enforced cessation of physical auctions in the UK, we faced restrictions such as site closures
impacting the operation of the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate and recorded a reduction in the movement and
inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. Our customers evolved their business models, for example
by motor dealers operating a click-and-collect process during 2020 to be able to better deal with social
distancing restrictions and, by August 2020, average weekly trading volumes bounced back up to 31,000.
With the continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries, and the UK in particular, as well as
governments lifting restrictions to public life, we expect the demand for our services to be increasing. The shift
towards a more digital operation model has, to an extent, mitigated the impact of COVID 19 and the lifting of
COVID 19 restrictions is expected to increase demand in the long term as dealers look to restock their
inventory.

_Impact on Operations_

We have been and actively continue to monitor the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our operations, and
our priority has been the safety of our employees and other stakeholders. As governments in the jurisdictions
where we operate introduced restrictions at the outset of the COVID 19 pandemic, we quickly ceased physical
auctions and introduced social distancing and other modifications to our ways of working to remain
compliant. In response to the closure of our physical auction sites, we adopted swift measures to significantly


-----

reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of
maximizing our liquidity position. Specifically, we adopted the following measures, which were only necessary
during the time of the first lockdown in the UK during March 2020 to July 2020 and were not implemented
during the subsequent second and third lockdowns:

- successfully negotiated with debtors and creditors on payment terms;

- put on hold all non-essential and discretionary spend within the business, including any growth,
expansionary or investment capital expenditures and increased controls around the cash disbursement
process, including sign off by senior members of the finance team for any payments in excess of certain
reduced thresholds;

- negotiated tax deferrals with HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of value-added taxes (“VAT”)
and employment taxes; and

- entered into arrangements with landlords to defer rent payments during the period of closure.

We also made furlough arrangements for those staff unable to work in the UK where we furloughed as much
as 80% of our staff at the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020 and, in parallel, applied for employee
salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in continental Europe. Such schemes allow
companies to place employees on paid leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s
ordinary salary being partially reimbursed by the respective government. As of March 28, 2021, approximately
4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 furlough
income across all jurisdictions totaled £35.5 million and rates relief totaled £8.3 million. As of March 28,
2021, remaining deferrals comprise VAT deferrals of £15.8 million, which are expected to be settled in full in
instalments during the fiscal year 2022. As a result of the numerous cost-cutting and transitory measures
taken at the beginning of the first lockdown in the UK, we came out of that lockdown with greater liquidity
compared to our liquidity going into such lockdown. From the end of the first lockdown in the UK, we have
managed to remain positive in terms of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA even in periods with government
restrictions comparable with the first lockdown in the UK. Given the success of our digital offering with our
clients and the level of profitability and efficiency achieved, we currently have no intention of reverting back
to our previous predominantly physical auction model.

_Impact on Results of Operations and Liquidity Update_

For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17
COVID Adjusted EBITDA were £190.1 million and £204.1 million, respectively, reflecting an estimated
COVID 19 impact of £14.0 million in the fiscal year 2020. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021,
IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA were £168.0 million and £232.8 million,
respectively, reflecting an estimated COVID 19 impact of £64.8 million in the fiscal year 2021. For the 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019, we reported an operating profit of £100.2 million. For the unaudited aggregated
52-week period ended March 29, 2020, we reported an operating loss of £224.5 million. For the 52-week
period ended March 28, 2021, we reported an operating profit of £47.4 million. We had cash and cash
equivalents of £113.2 million and £247.2 million as of March 28, 2021 and March 29, 2020, respectively.

We seek to maintain sufficient amounts of liquidity with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to
provide financial flexibility. On April 29, 2020, we entered into the Existing Liquidity Facility Agreement,
providing us with increased liquidity and capacity for future investment and vehicle buying. As of March 28,
2021, £110.7 million (2020: £2.3 million) was available for borrowing under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility, in each case after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit.

_Impairment Review_

As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including
£938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA Acquisition. While goodwill impairment is tested annually, the
COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business constituted an impairment indicator that we assessed
with respect to all intangible assets as well as goodwill. The impairment review is performed on a “value-inuse” basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will
occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth rate. Any impairment charge is then recognized
in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable
amount. As a result of our impairment review conducted as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, we
recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment relating to the CA Acquisition in the amount of £266.4 million
in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge thereby specifically represented a change


-----

in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the
Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Business—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our_
_business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the_
_COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain” and “Operating and Financial Review—Factors Affecting Our Results of_
_Operations—COVID 19—Impairment Review.” We caution you that these impairment charges should not be_
regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding impairment charges
for any future period. See “Forward-looking Statements.”

any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus the


-----

applicable “make whole” premium as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum.

Prior to, 2023, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option,
to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes with the net proceeds of one or more specified equity
offerings at a redemption price equal to %, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of redemption, provided that at least 50% of
the aggregate principal amount (including any additional Notes)
remains outstanding after the redemption (unless all Notes are
redeemed substantially concurrently).

Prior to, 2023, the Issuer may also redeem during each
calendar year commencing with the Issue Date up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, at its
option, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 103%
of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

On or after, 2023, the Issuer will be entitled, at its
option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the
redemption prices set forth under the section of this Offering
Memorandum entitled “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional_
Amounts, if any.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the
Issuer may also redeem all, but not part, of the Notes at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any. See “Description of the

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuer, the Successor Company (as
defined “Description of the Notes”) or any Guarantor with
respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or
deduction for or on account of taxes unless required by law. If
the Issuer, the Successor Company or the Guarantors are
required by law to withhold or deduct amounts for or on
account of tax imposed by the UK (or certain other relevant
taxing jurisdictions) with respect to a payment to the holders of
the Notes, the Issuer, the Successor Company or the relevant
Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions, pay the additional
amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the
holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction is not
less than the amount that they would have received in the
absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description of the
_Notes—Additional Amounts.”_

**Further Issuance of Notes . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer will be
permitted to issue additional Notes. Additional Notes shall be
treated, along with all other notes issued under the Indenture, as
a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to
waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not
specifically distinguished for such series. For all purposes other
than U.S. federal income tax purposes, additional Notes shall be
deemed to form one series with any notes previously issued
under the Indenture if they have terms substantially identical in
all material respects to such other notes. In the event that any


-----

additional Notes issued after the date hereof and sold pursuant
to Rule 144A are not fungible with any notes previously issued
under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such
non-fungible additional Notes shall be issued with a separate
ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification
number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such
previously issued notes under the Indenture. Additional Notes
sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued
with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities
identification number as the applicable series of notes previously
issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such
series of notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a
U.S. holder (as defined under “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Consequences”) considering the purchase of_
Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of
Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax
advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition
of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of
additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series
of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of
being separately identified. In the event additional Notes are
issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number
as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued, without
being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests (as defined under
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) in the Regulation S Global
Notes (as defined under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) that
form part of that series, including in respect of investors that
hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on
or prior to the date of issuance of such additional Notes, will
not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a
Rule 144A Global Note (as defined under “Book-Entry, Delivery
_and Form”), if any, representing Notes of that same series. Such_
a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our
_Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—Additional Notes sold_
_pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes_
_for U.S. federal income tax purposes,” “Book-Entry, Delivery and_
_Form—Transfers” and “Description of the Notes—Additional_
_Notes.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the
Issuer may be required to offer to redeem the Notes at 101% of
the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any. A change of control,
will not be deemed to have occurred on one occasion if a
specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in

parent company of the Parent and (iii) pay costs, fees and
expenses (including prepayment costs) incurred in connection
with the Refinancing Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(1) We define IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA as Reported Adjusted EBITDA (which refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as reported in the
relevant Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated
Financial Information (representing operating profit/(loss) for the period, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and
significant or non-recurring items)), which is further adjusted to remove (i) the impact of IFRS 16 and (ii) the results relating to
cinch. We define IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA as IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA, which is further adjusted for the impact of the
COVID 19 pandemic. The following table presents a reconciliation of (a) operating profit/(loss) to Reported Adjusted EBITDA,
(b) Reported Adjusted EBITDA to IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and (c) IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA to IAS 17 COVID Adjusted
EBITDA:

(a) For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, this includes amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to the CA
Acquisition (£73.6 million), restructuring costs primarily relating to, among others, the management of longer term impacts
of the COVID 19 pandemic (£7.6 million), other significant or non-recurring costs including share based payment related
charges and contributions on subscription of shares relating to the set-up for the Management Incentive Program (see
“Management—Management Incentive Program”) (£13.0 million), non-recurring system costs (£2.0 million) and pension
costs in connection with a guaranteed minimum pension equalization adjustment (£0.7 million). For the unaudited aggregated
52-week period ended March 29, 2020, this includes amortization of acquired intangible assets (£53.5 million), transaction
costs relating to the CA Acquisition (£60.0 million), restructuring costs (£2.3 million), debt fees written off on refinancing
(£0.4 million) and impairment of acquired intangibles relating to the longer term impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic
(£266.4 million). For the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, this includes amortization of acquired intangible assets
(£40.2 million), restructuring costs (£2.9 million), credit arising on a compulsory purchase order (£2.3 million), aborted
transaction costs (£0.3 million) and pension costs in connection with a guaranteed minimum pension equalization adjustment
(£2.2 million).

(b) IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and we have adopted IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019 under the modified
retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 recognized on adoption as an adjustment to opening
equity. Under this approach, comparative information for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a
result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. For all other
periods presented in the table above, we have made IFRS 16 adjustments representing the removal of IAS 17 operating lease
costs previously reported within cost of sales and operating costs. Total financial indebtedness (excluding finance leases
borrowings under the Receivables Facility) as presented under “Capitalization” excludes our financial lease obligations.

(c) Represents the add back of start-up costs made in cinch, which was sold to an affiliate of a parent company of the Parent in
September 2020.

(d) For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of
operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020
(£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more
normalized period of trading. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are
calculated by replacing the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£2.0 million) and the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£43.9 million) with the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020
(£44.5 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£66.2 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of
operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29,
2020, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by adding back an amount of £11.3 million (based on management
forecasts using operating results for March 2020 immediately prior to lockdowns, reflecting restrictions on operating activities
due to COVID 19) and an amount of £2.7 million (representing provisions relating to bad debt and inventory). For the
52-week period ended March 31, 2019, no adjustments relating to COVID 19 were made.

Facility), as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing Transactions.

(19) We define Adjusted Net Senior Secured Debt as Adjusted Total Senior Secured Debt less Adjusted Cash.

(20) We define Adjusted Total Debt as bank borrowings (excluding our finance leases), as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing
Transactions.

(21) We define Adjusted Net Debt as Adjusted Total Debt minus Adjusted Cash.

(22) We define Adjusted Cash Interest Expense as interest expense of the third-party financial indebtedness of the CA Group following
the Refinancing Transactions, including borrowings under Senior Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Facility, the issuance of
the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if the Refinancing Transactions occurred on March 30, 2020, and
excluding (i) any interest expense with respect to other indebtedness of the Group which has since been extinguished, (ii) interest
expense with respect to the Receivables Facility since borrowings under the Receivables Facility do not constitute indebtedness
under the Indenture, (iii) interest expense with respect to our finance leases and (iv) commitment fees with respect to the Revolving
Credit Facility since these are treated as interest expense for accounting purposes.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks,_
_together with the other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest_
_in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could be detrimental to our financial_
_performance. If any of these events occur, the trading price of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay_
_all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional_
_risks not currently known to us or which are presently deemed immaterial may also harm our business and affect_
_your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might_
_cause such differences include those discussed below. See “Forward-looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**_The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business,_**
**_operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19_**
**_pandemic is uncertain._**

In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID 19”) was identified
in Wuhan, China. This COVID 19 outbreak has since spread and grown globally, including in each of the
countries in which we operate, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in
March 2020. Although the ultimate severity and impact of the COVID 19 pandemic remains uncertain, the
COVID 19 pandemic and measures taken to combat it have had, and are expected to continue to have, a
significant negative impact on the economy in the countries in which we operate and the automotive industry
as a whole. The measures taken to combat COVID 19 include restrictions on public life, curfews, forced
temporary business closures (including the closure of significant elements of our business) and lockdowns as
well as social distancing protocols and the general advice to stay at home given the health risks associated with
COVID 19. As a result, all aspects of our business have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially
negatively impacted.

In the used vehicle market, car registration agencies and car dealerships were temporarily closed, car dealers
sought to reduce their inventory and some consumers chose to delay or abandon car purchases. Due to the
unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers, leasing
companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private
consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace,
particularly at physical auction and logistics sites were significantly impacted during the fiscal year 2021 with
average weekly trading volume dipping to 4,000 at the start of the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021,
compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020. In a number of countries our
physical auctions and other operating sites have been required to close as a result of government legislation,
as have many WeBuyAnyCar sites for periods of varying length. Interruptions to the businesses of our
customers (including OEMs, leasing companies, dealers and fleet providers) resulted in unpredictable and
reduced volumes of vehicles being handled by our Automotive Services division and a negative impact on
trading performance.

A significant proportion of our workforce (such as those involved in the physical movement of vehicles)
cannot work remotely and potentially face additional risks as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. In addition,
some of our sites are visited by customers as part of their normal operations. We cannot guarantee that
measures we take in order to limit the risks posed to such individuals will be sufficient and we may be subject
to potential litigation or enforcement action as result of staff or customers alleging that our working practices
are unsafe in this regard. Such litigation or enforcement action could result in material financial cost and
damage to our reputation and brands.

On July 10, 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we proactively and successfully negotiated certain covenant
waivers with respect to certain of our existing debt facilities in order to mitigate the anticipated effects of the
COVID 19 pandemic. These waivers were extended on January 22, 2021. However, a prolonged negative
impact due to the COVID 19 pandemic or other factors may adversely affect our ability to comply with the
financial covenants included in the Senior Facilities Agreement or any other similar agreement, and there can
be no assurance that we would be able to successfully negotiate the covenant waivers with our lenders in such
an event. The breach of a financial or other covenant or the failure to meet any of the obligations under our


-----

financing agreements governing our debt may result in a default or event of default under such agreements,
which in turn could result in a number of adverse consequences, including cross-defaults, the acceleration of
the outstanding amounts requiring immediate repayment of the related debt in part or in whole, significant
increases in interest rates and other financing and reputational costs. There is also no guarantee that debt
financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms
consistent with our expectations.

The COVID 19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and other
disruptions worldwide. It cannot be assured that conditions in the credit lending, capital and other financial
markets will not deteriorate as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, or that our access to capital and other
sources of funding will not become constrained or expensive, or that the credit or capital markets will be
available in the future to fund our obligations. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include
more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or
make such debt unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. If we are unable to access the credit
or capital markets in the longer term, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our ability to carry out
growth and business development initiatives would be limited, thereby potentially limiting our future growth
opportunities.

We also carry significant intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets
on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including £938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA
Acquisition. Pursuant to current accounting rules, we are required to assess goodwill and other intangible
assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Impairment
indicators include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected
future operating results and negative industry or economic trends. If such events were to occur, the carrying
amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we would be required to
record an impairment charge. The COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business initially constituted an
impairment indicator that we assessed and, accordingly, we recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment
of £266.4 million in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge represented a change
in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the
Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Summary—Recent
_Developments—Impact of COVID 19—Impairment Review” and “Operating and Financial Review—Factors_
_Affecting Our Results of Operations—COVID 19—Impairment Review.”_

As a matter of ordinary business operations, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our buyer finance
services, BCA Partner Finance. The negative economic impact of the COVID 19 pandemic may increase such
risk. While we maintain a well-established credit scoring matrix it cannot be assured that buyers repay their
debt owed to us on a widespread and systemic basis over an extended period of time.

We have participated in available government schemes designed to support businesses negatively impacted by
the COVID 19 pandemic. These schemes include mechanisms to allow companies to place employees on paid
leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s ordinary salary being partially
reimbursed by the respective government. In the UK, we have furloughed as much as 80% of our staff at the
peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020, such number subsequently dropping below 60% by June 2020,
and as of March 28, 2021, approximately 4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In addition, we
have also applied for and made use of employee salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in
the UK and continental Europe.

While we are carefully tailoring our use of these COVID 19 prompted measures to ensure retention of the
necessary knowledge and expertise to support the business going forward, as a result of these measures, there
could be a loss of institutional knowledge, experience, and/or expertise which could limit our ability to manage
the business effectively, react to external developments, retain vendors and make necessary technological
developments. Similarly, these measures may negatively impact the morale of our workforce, leading to
voluntary departures of additional employees. In addition, there can be no guarantee that similar schemes
will be available in the future in the event of further COVID 19 or similar public health related disruption. In
the event of future disruption and in the absence of similar support schemes, related costs may be significantly
higher than experienced during the previous periods of COVID 19 restrictions with a negative impact on our
ability to operate.

The overall impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend
on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. These factors include, but are not
limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and the ultimate severity of the
COVID 19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted and the


-----

length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our
knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For
these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business with any
certainty nor can we provide any assurance that the COVID 19 pandemic will not continue to have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To the extent the COVID 19
pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, it may also
have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section of this Offering Memorandum entitled
“Risk Factors,” including those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our ability to generate sufficient
cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the
agreements that govern our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes.

In addition, as a consequence of the significantly increased volatility and instability experienced during
periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, it is difficult for us to forecast demand trends. We may be
unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result
of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future
macroeconomic cycles. A decline in demand due to adverse macroeconomic conditions may also have an
adverse impact on the business of the automotive industry and require us to substantially increase the amounts
of financial assistance, to carry on our operations.

**_We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we_**
**_have operations and customers._**

We operate in the UK and in a number of continental European countries while selling vehicles to buyers in a
wider geographic area. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly,
by global economic conditions, such as instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business
confidence, interest rates, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges such as uncertain or changing political
or regulatory environments.

A potential prolonged economic slowdown in the UK and continental Europe resulting from the COVID 19
pandemic poses a risk to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and the communities in which they and
we operate. The current status of the COVID 19 pandemic around the world remains serious, and while there
is cause for optimism (with the continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries and the UK in
particular), there can be no assurance that vaccinations are effective and reopening will not be reversed in
response to a resurgence in COVID 19 outbreaks. Negative economic developments, including due to global
or local recessions, higher unemployment rates, diminished levels of consumer confidence, declines in income
levels and the loss of wealth, have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in decreased demand in the
automotive industry. The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic may be associated with further or continued decline
in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels which may negatively impact the demand for
vehicles from consumers and business users. Since we rely on strong demand for the used vehicle market, we
are particularly dependent on consumer confidence and spending power, two factors that are strongly
influenced by overall economic conditions.

Moreover, national and local governments may impose limitations and restrictions on the operation of our
business in response to any future COVID 19 resurgence, and the impact of those restrictions may have a
detrimental effect on our ability to operate (including but not limited to social distancing and other health and
safety related measures, and possibly preventing or restricting some elements of our business from trading at
all). Compliance with such regulations requires the application of financial and human resources and increases
costs to the potential detriment of our business. Failure by us to comply, or the perception of non-compliance,
with any such regulations may lead to enforcement action against us with possible financial costs and could
also damage our brands and reputation.

Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, adverse economic conditions in
the countries where we have operations may negatively impact our financial results, and that of our vendors
and buyers. Activity levels in the automotive industry can be affected by such factors as the availability of
consumer credit, the growth of average wages and the level of unemployment, among others, which in turn
could impact the volume of vehicles we handle. In addition, if OEMs in the UK were to experience declining
new vehicles sales, the used vehicle market could in turn be negatively impacted, which would affect our
Vehicle Buying division and Vehicle Remarketing division. Due to the relative size of our UK operations,
compared to our operations in continental Europe, we are more exposed to changes in the UK economic
environment.


-----

The wider geopolitical environment in the UK and continental Europe is also beyond our control. Our
business and operations are adversely affected by unstable or deteriorating international trade conditions. For
example, the withdrawal of the UK from the EU effective December 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as
“Brexit”) have resulted in substantial regulatory uncertainty regarding international trade and trade policy.
Moreover, our international operations are subject to risks associated with the prevailing local political,
economic and regulatory climate. For instance, it may be more difficult in certain jurisdictions for us to enforce
contracts, collect receivables, terminate labor contracts, receive dividends and transfer funds. In addition, we
may face risks associated with unexpected changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in relation to
complexity of domestic and international customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences,
restrictions on foreign trade or investment, currency exchange and capital controls, nationalization and
expropriation and cancelation of our contractual relationships without full compensation for loss. Any of the
aforementioned changes to general economic, political and regulatory conditions, and in particular any
changes in the regulatory environment and potentially adverse tax consequences as a result thereof, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are dependent on the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace._**

Our business is vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply of vehicles to our sales platforms, including our digital
and physical auction sites (together, the “Marketplace”), which in turn depends on a variety of factors. For
example, declines in demand in the automotive industry resulting from adverse macroeconomic conditions
have historically adversely impacted used vehicle trade-ins to dealers, which has in turn reduced our auction
volumes, as dealers represent a large proportion of our vendors. In addition, the supply of vehicles from
corporate vendors, including contract hire, leasing and finance companies, can also be affected by adverse
economic conditions if corporate vendors reduce the size of, or delay the renewal of, their fleets during an
economic downturn. OEMs have also in the past reduced the number of vehicles manufactured during periods
of macroeconomic decline, which, over time, can adversely affect the number of used vehicles in the market
and thus the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace.

Additionally, legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect the supply of vehicles to the
Marketplace. Furthermore, the supply of vehicles could also decrease if our vendors elect to sell their vehicles
directly to our buyers, including private consumers. If, as a result of the foregoing factors or for any other
reason, the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Furthermore, our ability to provide a large, attractive offering of used vehicles within our Vehicle Remarketing
division depends on the number and quality of used vehicles we are able to purchase through WeBuyAnyCar,
and the public’s willingness to tender their vehicles to our Vehicle Buying division. There can be no assurance
that the supply of suitable vehicles at competitive prices will be sufficient to meet our needs and to continue to
grow our offering. In addition, difficulties in sourcing a suitable inventory of used vehicles may arise, among
others, due to errors from the proprietary pricing model we use to calculate purchase prices within
WeBuyAnyCar, or a failure to adjust our pricing model in order to meet the most recent market trends. If we
are unable to source a suitable inventory at competitive prices as a result of any of these factors, our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

**_We depend on a limited number of vendors for a substantial portion of the vehicles we sell._**

Historically, a limited number of vendors have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of the vehicles
sold through the Marketplace, notwithstanding the fact that WeBuyAnyCar (which sources vehicles from
individual consumers) contributed 35% of all vehicles we remarketed in the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, thereby partially de-risking our supply. The majority of sales arrangements with our vendors do not
guarantee the provision of a minimum number of vehicles to us. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance
that our largest vendors will continue to provide us with a supply of vehicles, or that we would be able to
replace the volumes of vehicles provided by these vendors were they to materially decrease. In addition, if one
or more of our vendors’ financial condition deteriorates, or if a vendor were to restructure its operations, our
loss of access to the vendor’s vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is vulnerable to declines in demand for used vehicles._**

If the demand for new or used vehicles decreases in the markets in which we operate, the volumes of, and the
prices paid for, vehicles sold through the Marketplace may decrease, which in turn could reduce our margins.
Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, no assurance can be given that


-----

such market remains stable in times of economic downturn. A decline in demand from our buyers could be
caused by a variety of factors, including adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as stagnant
growth, a decline in disposable income or consumer confidence and restricted access to consumer financing.
High fuel prices may also disproportionately affect demand for vehicles with poor fuel-efficiency and lead to
a reduction in the miles driven per vehicle, which could affect the number of vehicles sold through the
Marketplace. Additionally, rising interest rates may depress sales of new or used vehicles because many
purchasers finance their purchases. Furthermore, adverse changes in the credit quality of our buyers, arising
from macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, could also lead to lower sales, as well as increase our
counterparty risk. Any reduction in demand for used vehicles caused by these or any other reason could have
a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by a general decline in vehicle ownership or sudden changes in demand for certain_**
**_types of used vehicles._**

Demand for our used vehicles may be adversely affected by trends that lead to an overall decline in demand
for vehicles. For example, environmental concerns surrounding certain types of vehicle (older diesel vehicles,
for example) or a growing share of younger people choosing not to purchase or lease their own vehicles,
opting for ride-hailing services, ride-sharing services, car rental services and public transportation instead.
These trends may continue or even intensify, in particular as urbanization continues and a growing share of
the population migrates to major cities. As a result, overall demand for vehicles, including for used vehicles,
may decline, which could adversely affect our business prospects.

Furthermore, demand for certain types of used vehicles may suddenly decline due to the introduction of
innovative technologies for new vehicles (e.g., autonomous driving systems). There is no guarantee that we
will be able to quickly source more innovative vehicles as it may take several years before they become available
in the used vehicle market. Consequently, sourcing and selling such vehicles may be more complex.

Likewise, actions by OEMs or car dealers may have a significant impact on demand in the used vehicle market.
If these parties decide to offer greater incentives for the sale of new vehicles (e.g., discounts or attractive
financing), or generally lower prices for new vehicles, this could make buying a new vehicle more attractive. As
a result, prices for used vehicles and our associated fees may decline. Prices may also decline due to insolvencies
of rental car companies or other companies with large fleets or an increased number of returns of leased
vehicles, which could result in oversupply. Conversely, any significant increase in market prices due to a scarcity
of used vehicles could impact our ability to source desirable inventory at acceptable prices and our volume
turnaround, which could have a material adverse effect on our continued growth and margins.

**_We face competition and may not be able to successfully adapt to industry changes._**

Across each of our divisions, we face competition from other market participants (both established and new
entrants). The Vehicle Buying division and the Vehicle Remarketing division face competition from other
vehicle buying and remarketing companies both in the UK and continental Europe. In the Automotive
Services division, we face competition from a broad range of competitors.

Due to the increasing use of the Internet and other technology as remarketing and distribution channels, we
also face increasing competition from online wholesale and retail vehicle selling platforms as well as from our
own vendors when they sell directly to end consumers rather than remarket vehicles through the Marketplace.
Increased competition could result in reduced profitability and/or loss of market share.

Our future success may be impacted by our ability to respond to evolving industry trends, changes in buyer
and vendor requirements and new technologies. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have greater
financial and marketing resources, may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry dynamics and
changes in vendor or buyer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of new or emerging services and technologies. If we are unable to compete successfully or
to successfully adapt to industry changes, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected.

**_A disruption in supply chains may adversely affect our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services_**
**_division._**

Our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division offer a wide range of non-auction
services, such as inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage and handling. These services expose
us to supply chain risks, as we are dependent on the availability of certain automotive parts and skilled labor


-----

to ensure that vehicles can move seamlessly along the automotive value chain, from collection through
inspection, repairs and onwards sale.

Any reduction, or any delays or disruptions, in the supply chains of the materials and components used by
our Vehicle Remarketing division or Automotive Services division could result in a significant disruption to
our operations and affect our ability to meet our commitments. Similarly, the lack of skilled labor to undertake
inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage as well as handling services could result in a significant
disruption to our operations. These disruptions may result from many reasons, including increasing demands
for certain automotive parts, closures of suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes,
mechanical failures or breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions, political upheaval, competition for
skilled labor as well as logistical complications resulting from severe weather or other natural disasters and
delayed customs processing. Financial difficulties of our major suppliers may also lead to delays in the delivery
of materials and components. The unavailability of any automotive parts or skilled labor required to deliver
our inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage and handling services could cause our Vehicle
Remarketing division and Automotive Services division to incur significant delays. The risk of disruptions in
the supply of materials and components that we use is heightened due to the greater political, economic and
social instability created by Brexit, which may lead to further complications with respect to customs processing
and/or may lead to limited transportation infrastructure and difficulties in finding alternative reliable, costefficient and qualified suppliers that can freely move between the UK and continental Europe. Brexit and the
related restrictions on free movement of labor across the English Channel has also heightened the risk that
skilled labor may be unavailable. See “—We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions
_and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers.”_

**_Our business is dependent on certain information and technology systems, and the failure to effectively maintain,_**
**_protect, develop or update these systems or cyber security attacks could have a negative impact on our business._**

Our business and financial performance depend on the effective operation of our information and technology
systems, increasingly including our cloud-hosted and digital selling platforms. It is therefore essential that key
systems, software and hardware are operational at all times. Substantially all of our remarketing buyers access
our systems via websites and/or mobile applications to view vehicles coming to auction prior to participating
in our auctions, and to participate in the various types of auctions and Bid Now/Buy Now sales themselves. In
addition, our customers also use WeBuyAnyCar’s online vehicle pricing quotation system to obtain a valuation
of their vehicle. We are therefore reliant on the operation of WeBuyAnyCar’s online platform, as well as a
number of mobile applications, which offer vehicle search functions, bidding features and access to live
information such as pricing, vehicle condition, and individual lot/auction timings. Our digital services are
accessed by a large number of users, often at the same time, and if user traffic increases, we may not be able to
scale our technology to accommodate increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or
delays in service. The business is also reliant on the systems that power the Automotive Services division’s
remote operations, such as transporters, inspect and collect operatives, appraisers and imaging.

We rely on a large range of computer and other information systems which are essential to our operations and
which became even more important during the COVID 19 pandemic, when our operating model shifted
towards an online business. Accordingly, the continued and uninterrupted performance of those systems,
along with their development and implementation, are vital factors in the operation of our business. We
depend on our technical infrastructure for all aspects of the day-to-day management of our business and the
delivery of our services. Any material disruption to the operation of such infrastructure, including as a result
of legislative and regulatory changes regarding online sales and e-commerce, may materially and negatively
affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Interruptions in these systems,
whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors or physical or electronic break-ins, or other
factors could affect the security or availability of our products and services on our websites or mobile
applications and prevent or inhibit the ability of vendors and buyers to access our services.

Electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks continue to increase in both prevalence and sophistication
throughout the digital world with the potential to corrupt, affect or destroy key systems and data, including
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. Given that techniques used in these
break-ins and attacks change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, it may
be impossible to properly secure our systems. In addition, technical advances or a continued expansion and
increased complexity of our digital offering could increase the likelihood of security breaches. The risk of
electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own
products, services and systems, but also of those of our customers, employees, contractors, business partners,
and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms.


-----

Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example,
unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those
of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal
information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware,
destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In
addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and
vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that
certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our
customers and its customers. Furthermore, these risks will increase as we continue to shift of our operating
model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Problems with the reliability,
availability or security of our systems and digital service offerings could harm our reputation, result in a loss
of vendors or buyers or necessitate additional costs, fines or penalties, any of which could harm our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain vendors, as a condition of operating through us, audit our information and technology systems.
These audits may require significant management time to address and could result in costly changes to
information and technology systems as a condition of continued operation. The loss of the supply of vehicles
from a vendor or the cost of changes to our information and technology systems following an audit could
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Robust back office systems, including auction information systems, are also critical to our ability to attract
visitors to our websites. These systems are also imperative for the operation of our website and mobile
applications, pricing, third-party data feeds, customer service, internal and external communications,
procurement, logistics, administration and financial reporting. In addition, we are dependent on certain
third-party information and technology systems, particularly with respect to payment processing, vehicle
licensing checks and fraud detection. In particular, we face liability risks in connection with online credit card
fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems, despite using market-standard protocols
designed to ensure enhanced security and strong identification for our customers when they use their debit or
credit cards for vehicle purchases. The failure or unavailability of any of our information and technology
systems to detect such type of fraud or other errors with respect to payment processing or vehicle licensing
checks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

Much of our physical information and technology infrastructure (including servers, website hosting, database
storage and wide area networks) is supplied by service providers via managed services contracts. Technical or
other service problems faced by our managed service providers could adversely affect the experience of our
vendors and buyers. Any financial or operational difficulties faced by our managed service providers or any of
the third-party service providers with whom they contract may have adverse effects on our business, the nature
and extent of which are difficult to predict. Furthermore, any disruption of the distribution channels or
networks used by our mobile applications could adversely affect the ability to access or update our mobile
applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our success also depends on our continued innovation and ability to provide features that make our websites
and mobile applications user-friendly, particularly through the development of specific software and
applications under a variety of new platforms and operating systems, which are generally expected by users to
offer the same features or flexibility and to be as easily and intuitively operated as desktop interfaces. As
technology improves and as our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to improve and
upgrade our systems and infrastructure, which may require substantial financial, operational and technical
resources. Delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may impair our ability to provide
digital services to our vendors and buyers or may reduce the effectiveness of digital auctions, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Acceptance of our digital platforms and mobile applications as suitable platforms for the sale and purchase of_**
**_used vehicles may decrease or fail to improve._**

The restrictions on physical sales activity (including physical auctions) due to the COVID 19 pandemic has
significantly increased the volume of vehicles traded digitally across the used vehicle market and via the
Marketplace. While the acceptance of our digital platforms has been strong by both buyers and vendors, there
is no guarantee that overall online acceptance in the used vehicle market will be maintained or increased. If
the acceptance of our digital offering decreases or fails to grow, we may not be able to achieve the future
growth we target.


-----

**_Our inventory and vehicles held on behalf of others may be damaged by extreme weather or other events outside_**
**_our control, and the insurance we carry may be inadequate._**

During the handling of new and used vehicles across the business, large numbers of vehicles are transported
and stored by us in both covered and open-air facilities. We are liable for the vehicles we own (the majority of
which are purchased through the Vehicle Buying division) and, in many cases, we are liable for the vehicles
supplied by vendors for auction through the Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as when we collect and
deliver vehicles through our logistics services. Extreme weather, such as hail storms, fire and flooding, which
has in the past damaged vehicles in our possession, natural disasters (such as extreme precipitation or extreme
temperature) or other catastrophic events (such as terrorism and large-scale accidents) may adversely affect
our physical facilities or damage vehicles awaiting sale or vehicles generally stored by us. Such risks are
particularly prevalent in respect of our open air facilities. In addition, there is no assurance that used vehicles
in our inventory will be properly protected (e.g., against theft or vandalism). This may result in an increase in
costs, delay or cancelation of auction sales, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue
and profitability. Our failure to meet vendors’ or buyers’ demands in such situations could further adversely
affect our reputation, reduce customer satisfaction, damage relationships with both vendors and buyers and
result in a loss of future business.

We maintain insurance cover for risks including property damage, business interruption, employers and public
liability, as well as for certain other claims consistent with customary practice in the industry in which we
operate. However, claims not covered by our insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage may arise, such
as from a natural disaster, theft or other causes outside our control.

Moreover, we may be unable in future periods to obtain insurance coverage on acceptable terms, without
substantial premiums increase or at all, particularly if there is deterioration in our claim experience history. A
successful claim against us, which is not covered by or in excess of our coverage could have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to complex taxation in multiple jurisdictions, in particular relating to valued-added taxes._**

We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, including in the UK and continental Europe. Because of
the complex interplay between our business and the various taxation regimes to which we are subject, the
provision made for taxes in the accounts involves a significant amount of judgement and uncertainty
regarding the interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to
existing tax laws or tax reporting obligations, or the introduction of new tax laws or obligations (for instance
with regards to online sales), in any of these jurisdictions could adversely impact our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations. The risks associated to unforeseen changes to existing tax laws
or tax reporting obligations are compounded by the uncertainty created by Brexit and legislatives changes in
connection thereto (see “—We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in
_the countries in which we have operations and customers”) and the shift of our operating model towards an_
online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will
_continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and_
_liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”)._

Additionally, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in many countries involving VAT and other
indirect taxes. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are responsible for collecting any VAT amounts due
on the vehicles we sell, and we rely on our vendors to provide accurate and complete information relating to
the VAT status of each vehicle to enable us to calculate the amount of any VAT due. We also rely on purchasers
of our vehicles at auction to provide accurate information regarding their residency in order to assess
appropriate treatment of VAT for sales invoices. If a vendor or buyer provides incorrect or incomplete VATrelated information, or if we fail to implement or fully comply with local VAT rules and regulations, we may
be exposed to VAT claims and fines from relevant authorities.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are frequently subject to VAT and other tax audits by relevant
authorities throughout Europe, and these audits can relate to matters that arose many years in the past. The
outcome of these audits could result in additional VAT claims and/or regulatory actions against us, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not successfully implement our strategic initiatives._**

Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our success in implementing our strategic and tactical
initiatives. These initiatives are focused on enhancing our competitive advantage as an integrated end-to-end


-----

service provider, further expanding internationally, strengthening our infrastructure and logistics network,
capitalizing on favorable industry trends, continuing to enhance our data capabilities and improving our
operational efficiencies, cash flow and leverage.

These initiatives will require extensive planning and management attention and entail substantial execution
risk. Notably, our strategy is focused on meaningful growth of vehicle volumes transaction through our
marketplaces. Such volume growth requires simultaneous success in several different domains including:
(i) commercial success with vendors, so they supply higher volume to our marketplaces; (ii) maintained data
leadership in order for the marketplaces to provide efficient liquidity to all participants; (iii) digital product
leadership to make our integrated services offering the most relevant in the market; and (iv) best-in-class
logistics and services footprint to deliver an integrated end-to-end digital and physical service. Failure to
maintain our competitive advantages in any of these dimension could have a material could have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new digital
platforms will also require substantial IT support and infrastructure and, as we grow, we will need to ensure
our back-office IT systems are integrated across our operations.

With respect to the Vehicle Buying division, our strategy places particular importance on expanding
WeBuyAnyCar’s operations. However, there can be no assurance that WeBuyAnyCar will continue to grow in
the UK. As we seek to expand car buying into new markets, we may also need to comply with unfamiliar
regulatory regimes. In addition, because car buying involves purchasing vehicles and holding them as
inventory until their sale (in contrast to our UK Vehicle Remarketing division and our International Vehicle
Remarketing division, which do not include WeBuyAnyCar’s operations, and do not take title to the majority
of vehicles that they sell), the expansion of such operations may increase our cash requirements and inventory
risk, thereby increasing our depreciation and impairment charges. Similarly, recalls by OEMs are a common
occurrence and have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. In case of such recalls, we may have to
temporarily remove the affected used vehicles from our inventory and may be unable to liquidate such
inventory in a timely manner or at all. The same may occur if regulatory changes (e.g., the introduction of
stricter emission standards) prevent consumers from driving certain used vehicles in cities or at all,
consequently reducing demand for the affected vehicles. If we are unable to sell the vehicles purchased at an
appropriate price, or at all, we may incur write-downs or our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, the implementation of our strategic initiatives in certain international markets may not produce
the benefits achieved in markets where we already have established operations. Each new market that we enter
will require us to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with that
new market, which may entail finding new partners, hiring and training new staff with local language skills
and an understanding of the local market, and learning the customs and cultures of the new country. These
processes can be difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Additionally, our business
strategies may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe
are important to our business.

Our inability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives could result in, among others, the loss of
clients and personnel, the loss of market share, the impairment of assets and inefficiencies from operating in
new markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to successfully identify and acquire or integrate future acquisitions into our business._**

Our growth has been, in part, attributable to the acquisition of other businesses, and we may continue to
expand our business through acquisitions and other business combinations in the future. The success of our
acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to assess the value,
strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, to
negotiate acceptable purchase terms, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals and to integrate the
operations of such businesses, once acquired. Successful integration of future acquisitions will depend on our
ability to effect any necessary changes in operations or personnel resulting from the acquisition. Acquisitions
may also expose us to new risks, including difficulties in integrating and operating businesses in countries that
are new to us, difficulties integrating acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, unforeseen legal,
regulatory, contractual, employment or other issues or expenses arising out of an acquisition, potential
disruptions to our ongoing business caused by acquisitions, including pressure on management’s time and
resources, or an acquired business’ failure to meet our expectations or business plans. The occurrence of any


-----

of these risks could have an adverse impact on our ability to make acquisitions and may limit our growth,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may not be able to provide financing in order to offer stock funding (trade finance) to registered dealers_**
**_through BCA Partner Finance or to repossess the financed vehicles serving as collateral._**

To support the attractiveness of our offering, we seek to help certain registered dealers in the UK by offering
stock funding (trade finance). To this end, we have entered into a £220 million non-recourse receivables facility
(the “Receivables Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, who provide the liquidity to support our BCA Partner
Finance business, of which £148.3 million was drawn as of March 28, 2021. If these banks are no longer
willing to provide financing to us or only grant such financing on disadvantageous terms, we may not be able
to offer attractive financing options to registered dealers. As a result, demand for our used vehicles may suffer
and we may not be able to grow our business as envisaged.

In addition, we use our sold vehicles as security when offering stock funding (trade finance) and cooperate
with third-party collection agents to repossess such vehicles, should registered dealers default on their
obligations. We may, however, not be able to locate the relevant vehicles and successfully repossess them (e.g.,
if they are transported outside the UK). Furthermore, the residual value of the repossessed vehicles may be
lower than anticipated (e.g., if they are involved in accidents), and we may not be able to take recourse against
the relevant car dealer. As a result, we may incur significant losses even where we use sold vehicles as security
for BCA Partner Finance. See “Business—Operations—Value-Added Services—Post-auction Services.”

**_We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights._**

Our intellectual property rights include proprietary technology and software relating to digital auction systems
as well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property. Our increased reliance in
recent years on proprietary Internet-based programs and technology have increased the relative importance
of intellectual property assets to our business. Our business and IT systems and other key proprietary
intellectual property generally are not protected by patents or registered design rights. As a result, we are
particularly reliant on trademarks, copyright, database rights, registered domain names and the law protecting
confidential information to protect our brands, technologies, software and databases. Although we have taken
steps to reduce these risks, these steps may be inadequate. Effective intellectual property protection also may
not be available in every country in which our services are offered, deployed or made available. Any significant
impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could
have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, we may be required to spend significant funds on monitoring and protecting our intellectual
property rights and we may not be able to discover all infringements, misappropriations or other violations of
our intellectual property. If we initiate litigation against infringements of our intellectual property, such
litigation may prove costly and there is no guarantee that it will ultimately be successful and that the rulings
we obtain will adequately remedy the damage we have suffered. In addition, we provide certain information to
third-party service providers who help us assess the performance of our business (e.g., Google Analytics).
Consequently, we only have limited control to ensure that such information is not misused by such service
providers or passed on to third parties, including our competitors.

**_We may be accused of infringing on the intellectual property of third parties._**

As we utilize a variety of intellectual property for our business, vendors, regulatory authorities or other third
parties may allege that we infringe on their intellectual property, and we may therefore become subject to
allegations and litigation against us. Even unfounded allegations of infringement may adversely affect our
reputation and business and may require significant resources to defend against. If we try to obtain licenses
from such third parties to settle these disputes, there is no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us
on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be required to alter our brands and change the way we
operate.

Furthermore, some of the agreements we enter into with third parties may contain clauses regarding the
protection of their intellectual property licensed to us. A violation of these clauses (e.g., the unauthorized
sub-licensing or disclosure of a confidential source code) may require us to pay significant penalties, prevent
us from utilizing such intellectual property in the future and result in litigation against us. In addition, some of
our proprietary technology was developed on the basis of proprietary and non-proprietary software licensed
from third parties. If these licenses were to be challenged or found invalid through litigation or other


-----

proceedings, we may not be able to continue to utilize such proprietary technology. In addition, the licensors
or other third parties may claim that the use of such technology is outside the scope of the relevant license and
therefore infringes upon their intellectual property.

**_We may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations, in particular those governing the trading of_**
**_used vehicles and the automotive industry in general._**

We are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the
purchase and sale of used vehicles, the state of such vehicles, the use of the internet, online payments,
consumer protection, data protection as well as road traffic, environmental, planning and employment
matters, and the application of such laws and regulations by local authorities may vary.

We may face risks associated with unexpected changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in relation
to complexity of domestic and international customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences,
restrictions on foreign trade or investment, currency exchange and capital controls, nationalization and
expropriation and cancelation of our contractual relationships without full compensation for loss.

Any changes in the laws and regulations, applicable to our business and operations, including used vehicles in
our inventory, as well as the Marketplace, or changes to the application and interpretation of such laws and
regulations by authorities and courts, may adversely affect our operations (such as the supply of vehicles) or
may give rise to substantial compliance costs, adjustment expenses and other costs as well as fines in
connection with our business activities, or prevent us from executing our strategy as planned. Even legislative
initiatives and the corresponding public debates could result in significant uncertainty, regardless of whether
such initiatives ultimately become law. We must comply with such regulations to the extent they are applicable
to us as noncompliance could lead to the imposition of fines or other sanctions.

**_Our failure to prevent unauthorized access to personal data or otherwise process personal data in accordance_**
**_with applicable data protection laws could result in legal liability for, and reputational harm._**

We process and store personal data as part of our business, including in relation to our employees, vendors
and buyers. Strict data protection laws exist in both the UK and throughout continental Europe. These data
protection laws require us to ensure an appropriate level of security of personal data, having regard to the
possibility of damage to and the nature of the data. Failure to take appropriate information security measures
could result in personal data being processed in an unauthorized or potentially unlawful manner.

The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) and the UK Data
Protection Act 2018 significantly change the data protection landscape in the EU and the UK. Such laws and
regulations strengthen the rights of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing of
personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with
substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights.
The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf,
including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought.
Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased obligations to notify regulators and
data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition of significant
sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes with associated
response plans. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is relatively complex. We, or
the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in the future into
employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be compliant with applicable data
protection laws and regulations. Moreover, our customers frequently require that we demonstrate our
compliance with data protection laws as they deem appropriate with respect to any personal data we may
process on their behalf. Failure to demonstrate such compliance to their satisfaction may result in action
including, but not limited to, the loss of contracts with such customers.

The failure to comply with our obligations under applicable data protection laws could potentially result in us
being issued with undertakings, enforcement notices (the failure with which to comply would be a criminal
offence) and fines, as well as suffer damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate, some of which are_**
**_unsettled and still developing._**

Our operations are subject to compliance with extensive laws and regulations, both in the UK and across
continental Europe, including, but not limited to, laws relating to vehicle brokerages and auctions, currency


-----

reporting obligations, data protection, competition, consumer protection, advertising, the Internet, property
usage, money laundering, bribery and taxation. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could
result in fines, criminal sanctions, liability to third parties, license revocation and reputational damage, which
in turn could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as well as our profitability. Furthermore, if
laws and regulations are not enforced equally against our competitors in a particular market, our compliance
with laws and regulations may put us at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis non-complying competitors.

Changes in laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to us may also increase
the costs of providing services or limit our ability to expand our service offerings, any of which could adversely
impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. More stringent laws or
regulations may impose additional burdens on us, and it is difficult to predict the impact of new or amended
laws or regulations to which we may become subject. There is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing
number of laws, regulations and court decisions pertaining to the Internet and online commerce, which may
relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet. For example, in certain
jurisdictions where we operate, local regulations impose restrictions on or prohibit credit and debit card
operations in order to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected, processed
and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. The growth and development of online commerce has
also prompted calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts by
regulatory authorities that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally.

Because of our relatively large physical property portfolio, we are also subject to the risk that we could be
compelled by government authorities to sell or vacate the property on which we operate or to make significant
changes to the operations and activities we undertake to comply with changes to planning regulations.

Furthermore, because of our international operations, the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject
may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory
issues in another, thereby making compliance more difficult and increasing the costs of conducting our
business. In addition, if we were to expand into new countries, we could face legal, regulatory or tax
requirements with which we are not familiar.

Compliance with current or future laws and regulations to which we are subject could place significant
demands on our resources, as well as subject us to unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax
consequences, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our costs could materially increase._**

Our largest cost is payroll, driven primarily by the number of our employees and their wages and salaries. If
relationships with our employees were to deteriorate, we could experience strikes, unionization efforts or
other types of conflicts, which could lead to interruption to our operations and increased costs. In addition,
payroll costs could increase because we compete with other service providers to recruit and retain skilled
employees, which has become more challenging as a result of Brexit and the related restrictions on free
movement of labor across the English Channel. High employment levels can lead to scarcity of staff and a
corresponding increase in the wages and salaries necessary to attract and retain suitable employees may be
indispensable in the future. In addition, future legislative changes relating to the minimum wage could
necessitate an increase in payroll costs.

We also undertake significant marketing activities, in particular for our Vehicle Buying division, and any
increase in television, radio and Internet advertising rates could increase our operating expenses. Moreover,
we incur significant fuel, power and other consumable supply costs across our operations that may escalate
and there can be no assurance that our costs will not grow at a faster rate than our revenue. If we are unable
to pass on future cost increases to our vendors or buyers, our operating profit margin could be adversely
affected, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on the strength of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness may_**
**_increase._**

Our brands, corporate image and reputation constitute a significant part of our value proposition. Our success
over the years has largely depended on our ability to develop our brands and corporate image as a leading
vehicle auction company in the UK and continental Europe. In addition, the WeBuyAnyCar consumer brand
in the UK is particularly important to the Vehicle Buying division, and the development of the WeBuyAnyCar
brand historically has required significant financial expenditure, particularly on marketing and advertising.


-----

In order to maintain WeBuyAnyCar’s reputation, we have to be able to respond to changes in marketing and
advertising rules, consumer sentiment and consumer preferences, all of which may change rapidly and as a
result of factors outside of our control. Our brands could be adversely affected by the actions of other
companies that damage the reputation of our industry as a whole, in particular in relation to the Vehicle
Buying division, as several companies operate under names similar to WeBuyAnyCar’s name. As we seek to
expand our operations, maintaining and increasing the awareness and perceived quality of our brands and
corporate image will be important to attract and expand our vendor and buyer base.

We use Internet search engines, in particular Google, to generate traffic to our websites. The purchase of
keywords consists of anticipating words and terms consumers will use to search on Internet search engines
and then bidding on those words and terms in the applicable search engine’s auction system. Search engines,
including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results
of a search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be adversely
affected. Our positioning on a search engine’s search results depends on algorithms designed by the search
engine provider and are based on various criteria including, in particular, the historical level of traffic on our
websites. As a result, if search engine providers change their search algorithms in a manner that is
competitively disadvantageous to us, our ability to generate traffic to our websites would be harmed.
Furthermore, our mobile applications rely on app stores operated by third parties, in particular Apple, which
make mobile applications available for download. The structure of these app stores may change and
third-party operators may decide to exclude our mobile applications from their offering (e.g., if we do not
agree to changes in terms and conditions), which may adversely affect the availability of our mobile
applications. These operators may also charge us fees to list our mobile applications for download, which
could adversely affect our margins or result in us discontinuing to offer our mobile applications through
third-party app stores.

We will continue to invest in, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as well as other efforts to
preserve and enhance customer awareness of our brands. In particular, we expect to spend significant amounts
on television, radio and Internet advertising to support WeBuyAnyCar, which is a purely customer brand.
There can be no assurance, however, that our advertising campaigns will successfully maintain or enhance
customer awareness of our brands. Advertising campaigns may be ineffective and may even have adverse
effects on website traffic and brand perception as a result of factors potentially out of our control, such as
changes in consumer preferences and regulatory reforms impacting advertising and marketing rules. Even if
we are successful in our branding efforts, significant costs are incurred in order to develop, deploy and update
our advertising campaigns, and as a result our efforts may not be cost-effective because, among others,
assumptions regarding required customer acquisition costs and resulting revenue prove to be incorrect. In
addition, we cannot guarantee that our current marketing channels will continue to be effective, permissible
and generally available to us in the future. For television marketing, the program during which we broadcast
our commercials may not achieve the anticipated number of viewers. For our online marketing, the relevant
partners may be unable to deliver the anticipated traffic to our website and mobile applications. In particular,
the popularity of social media channels tends to fluctuate, making it difficult to predict which channels are
best suited to reach a mass audience. Moreover, any negative publicity may be accelerated through social
media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) due to its immediacy and accessibility as a means of
communication. Social media and websites immediately publish posts from users, often without filters or
checks on the accuracy of the content posted. New and existing customers value readily available information
concerning digital offerings and often act on such posts without further investigation or authentication.
Allegations against us may be posted on social media, in Internet chat rooms or on blogs or websites by
anyone on an anonymous basis. Any negative publicity, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated
incidents, or the failure to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a
cost-effective manner could damage our reputation, diminish the strength of our brands, undermine the trust
and credibility we have established, have a negative impact on our ability to attract new or retain existing
customers and require us to spend significant time and money to address such negative publicity.

**_We may not be able to effectively communicate with our customers through email and other messages._**

We use newsletters (e.g., emails) as a free marketing tool to promote our digital and physical offering, website
and mobile applications. Our emails may, however, be shown as “spam”or given a lower priority, which could
reduce the likelihood of addresses opening or responding positively to them. Actions by third parties to
block, impose restrictions on, or charge for the delivery of, emails and other messages, as well as legal or
regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing additional requirements, could impair
our ability to communicate with customers. If we are not able to use unpaid marketing tools in the form of
emails or other messages efficiently, this could impair our marketing efforts or make them more expensive if
we have to increase spending on paid marketing channels.


-----

Furthermore, malfunctions of our email and messaging services could result in erroneous messages being sent
and customers no longer wanting to receive any messages from us. Furthermore, our process to obtain consent
from visitors to our website and users of our mobile applications to receive newsletters and other messages
from us and to allow us to use their data may be insufficient or invalid or become so as result of regulatory or
legislative changes. As a result, such individuals or third parties may accuse us of sending unsolicited
advertisements and other messages, which could result in claims or regulatory action being brought against
us.

**_Dissatisfaction with our customer service could prevent us from expanding our business as intended._**

To provide customer service, we communicate via email and through our telephone hotlines. The satisfaction
of our customers depends in particular on the effectiveness of our customer service, in particular our ability
to deal with complaints (e.g., with respect to the quality of used vehicles, technical problems, payment and
shipping, defects and invoicing) in a timely and satisfying manner. Any unsatisfactory response or lack of
responsiveness (e.g., due to interruptions of our hotlines) could reduce customer satisfaction and loyalty and
therefore adversely affect our revenue and profitability.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations._**

We report our results in pound sterling, and pound sterling is also our functional currency. However, we
conduct operations in the UK and continental Europe, as a result of which approximately 11% of our revenue
in the fiscal year 2021 was denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, with the significant majority
of this denominated in euro. Our results of operations may therefore be affected by both the transaction and
translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when we incur costs or earn revenue in a
currency other than the pound sterling. For example, because we report in pound sterling, our consolidated
results would be adversely affected by the depreciation of the euro relative to the pound sterling, as this would
result in reduced euro-denominated earnings, an effect which could increase were our European operations to
expand, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, we are subject to additional taxation as a result of any foreign exchange gain arising
in respect of the interest on our euro-denominated indebtedness, which could similarly have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Environmental, health and safety risks could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition._**

We operate from multiple locations across the UK and continental Europe. Large numbers of vehicles are
stored and prepared for sale at these sites, and during that time releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials
may occur. In addition, members of the public and our employees come into close contact with vehicles
moving on or around our sites. Furthermore, our employed and contracted drivers collect and deliver large
numbers of vehicles across both the UK and continental Europe and our fleet of vehicle transporters carries
large numbers of vehicles annually. Consequently, our operations are subject to various environmental and
health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission and discharge of pollutants
into the air and water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and
the investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as regulations requiring adequate precautions to
prevent injuries arising from collisions and impacts with vehicles moving within our locations and on public
roads. For example, governments increasingly introduce low emission zones in certain geographical areas,
where the most polluting vehicles are regulated and vehicles with higher emissions, including vehicles in
support of the Automotive Services division, cannot enter, thereby limiting our operations. We may incur
expenditures relating to accidents causing injury to individuals, releases of hazardous materials, investigative,
remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures,
individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply
with permits required under such laws, could also subject us to significant liability or require costly
investigative, remedial or corrective actions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees and management personnel could harm our business._**

Our success is in part driven by the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and by the efforts,
ability and experience of key members of our management staff. The members of our senior management
team have extensive experience in the industry in which we operate and have skills that are critical to the


-----

operation of our business, including their relationships with, and understanding of the requirements of, the
relevant regulatory authorities in the industry in which we operate. We have implemented policies and
remuneration designed to retain and properly incentivize management; however, there can be no guarantee
that we will be able to attract and retain qualified candidates to replace or succeed members of senior
management, should the need arise. The loss of services of any of our management staff could significantly
weaken our management expertise and our ability to deliver our services efficiently and effectively, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Because we operate in a rapidly changing and increasingly digitalized market, our success also depends to a
significant extent upon our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified technical
personnel. Our employees have specialized knowledge that is in high demand, and competition for suitably
qualified individuals with the relevant technical expertise in our industry and in the locations in which we
operate is intense and may further increase as more vehicle auction companies in the UK and continental
Europe shift their operating model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. We
have a dedicated team of data scientists and have been able to utilize our data pool to develop highly accurate
pricing capabilities based on age, mileage and condition, which permit us to maximize margins in real time. If
we are unable to identify, attract, develop, motivate, adequately compensate and retain well-qualified and
engaged personnel, or if existing highly skilled and specialized personnel leave us and successors or adequate
replacements are not readily available, we may not be able to manage our operations effectively, which could
cause us to suffer delays in new service offerings, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements
or otherwise fail to satisfy our customers’ demands, which would have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The difficulties in identifying, attracting and retaining suitable management personnel and employees are
exacerbated as a result of Brexit and free movement complications in relation thereto, which make travel
between the UK and continental Europe more difficult. In addition, we bear the risk that our key management
and key personnel becomes infected with COVID 19, and the measures adopted in response to the COVID 19
pandemic could make the integration of newly hired personnel more challenging. See “—The COVID 19
_pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial_
_condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.”_

**_We are subject to a substantial number of non-terminable long-term leases._**

We lease the majority of our properties, primarily comprising properties in the UK, pursuant to long-term
leases. These leases do not include break clauses. As a result, if we ceased operations at properties which we
could not subsequently sublet, we would continue to incur significant lease payments on these properties.

In addition, as we continue to shift our operations towards a fully digital business model, we may be required
to adapt the use of some or all of our properties. We may also decide to dispose of certain of our properties or
may seek to terminate certain of our leases. Similarly, if and when business operations resume and return to
pre-pandemic levels (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse
_effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of_
_the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”), we may also seek changes to our overall composition of portfolio of_
properties, or the related use thereof. Moreover, the current use of our properties may not necessarily be
appropriate or cost efficient for future operations. However, there can be no guarantee that it will be legally
permissible to change the use of our properties at such time or that we will be able to dispose of properties on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renegotiate
long-term leases, especially if we were to seek the termination of a lease that does not include a break clause.

**_We use standardized documents, contracts and terms and conditions, which may adversely affect our operations if_**
**_any agreement or clause were held to be invalid._**

We maintain relationships with a large number of vendors and buyers and, in this context, we regularly use
standardized terms and conditions, in particular in relation to the terms and conditions of sale and purchase
on our remarketing platforms and the terms and conditions applicable to WeBuyAnyCar customers.
Standardized terms and conditions have to comply with the statutory laws on general terms and conditions in
the different jurisdictions in which we operate, which means that in many jurisdictions they are subject to
intense scrutiny by the courts. The standard is even stricter if such terms and conditions are used vis-à-vis
private consumers, such as in our WeBuyAnyCar business. If standardized documents, contracts, or terms
and conditions we use contain provisions which are interpreted in a manner disadvantageous to us, or if any
clauses are held to be invalid and thus replaced by statutory provisions which are disadvantageous to us, a
large number of our contractual relationships could be affected. This could provide our counterparties with


-----

unexpected legal rights and remedies (e.g., withdrawal rights), cause us to incur unexpected expenses and
prevent us from operating our business as currently operated. In some cases, courts may even determine that
our standardized terms and conditions are generally invalid, and as a result we may not have entered into a
valid contractual relationship with the relevant counterparty.

**_We have several defined contribution pension schemes in certain continental European countries as well as two_**
**_defined benefit pension plans in the UK, some of which are in deficit._**

We participate in several defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and certain continental European
countries as well as two defined benefit pension plans in the UK. Our cash funding obligations are set in
accordance with applicable pension legislation, assessed on a triennial basis and required to be agreed between
us and independent trustees. Our cash funding obligations are further subject to increases in life expectancy.
Our total contribution to these defined contribution schemes in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021
was £6.4 million. We cannot guarantee that our future cash contributions will not undermine our capacity to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

In addition, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK are in deficit. As of March 28, 2021, the two
defined benefit pension plans in the UK had a deficit of £12.4 million (2020: £15.1 million). Plan liabilities, in
respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set
with reference to corporate bond yields. If the plan assets underperform such yield, then this will create a
deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisors, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each
plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. However, the plans hold only
a portion of assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) and we cannot guarantee that the
level of investment risk is reduced appropriately as the maturity approaches for each plan.

Moreover, while we have contractual caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension
obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation, our pension liabilities in deferment are linked
and subject to inflation. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that an increase in inflation will not lead to an
increase in our pension deficit. Furthermore, plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the
interest rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive
assets held by the plans. While such risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being
linked to bond yields, any decrease in interest rates has the effect of decreasing bond yields, which in turn
increases plan liabilities. Accordingly, the materialization of any of these risks, if significant, could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Significant differences exist between certain accounting principles, such as IFRS 16 and IAS 17, which may be_**
**_material to investors’ assessments of our financial condition, and certain financial information in this Offering_**
**_Memorandum is derived from unaudited management accounts, which are not comparable to audited financial_**
**_information._**

IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full fiscal year commencing on
or after that date. Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 since the fiscal year 2020. We have adopted IFRS 16
under the modified retrospective approach on April 1, 2019, with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16
on adoption recognized as an adjustment to opening equity. Under this approach, comparative information
for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have
been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020
Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not be
comparable insofar as they relate to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases). See “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information—IFRS Financial Information—Application of IFRS 16.”_

**_We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, which gives effect to the_**
**_Refinancing Transactions, as if it had occurred on March 30, 2020, and other financial information not prepared_**
**_in accordance with IFRS._**

We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, which gives effect to the
Refinancing Transactions, as if it had occurred on March 30, 2020. In addition, we have included certain
non-IFRS measures, including Reported Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 COVID
Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA, Underlying Cash CAPEX, Adjusted
Operating Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion, COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow and COVID
Adjusted Cash Conversion. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted
data) included in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared for information purposes only and have not


-----

been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting
principles or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards. These non-IFRS
measures and other information are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should
not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. The non-IFRS measures and other
information (including unaudited adjusted data) are based on available information and certain assumptions
and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates
are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may
differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and
other information (including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum are not
intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC
and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the SEC.
Certain of these amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any
independent accounting firm.

We have also included certain unaudited financial information prepared in accordance with IAS 17 (Leases),
which is an accounting standard that was superseded by IFRS 16. Such unaudited financial information has
important limitations; in particular, it is prepared in accordance with a historic accounting standard, IAS 17
(Leases), and has not been audited. As such, it is not comparable to the audited results due to adjustments
and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements or financial data
prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Moreover, some of the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is adjusted for the
estimated impact of COVID 19 and/or for certain run rate adjustments based on our most recent three months
of trading. In particular, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA and ratios derived therefrom seek to adjust
IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for the impact of COVID 19. The adjustments made to calculate IAS 17 COVID
Adjusted EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in
the circumstances but are included for illustrative purposes only and have not been audited. IAS 17 COVID
Adjusted EBITDA is not comparable to the audited results and should not be regarded as a substitute for the
Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments relating
to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for COVID-impacted periods with prior
non-COVID impacted periods, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period
of trading. For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated
by replacing the results of operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with
the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively,
thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 52-week
period ended March 28, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of
operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£2.0 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
2021 (£43.9 million) with the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£44.5 million)
and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£66.2 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of
operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended
March 29, 2020, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by adding back an amount of
£11.3 million (based on management forecasts using operating results for March 2020 immediately prior to
lockdowns, reflecting restrictions on operating activities due to COVID 19) and an amount of £2.7 million
(representing provisions relating to bad debt and inventory). Such information and adjustments are for
illustrative purposes only and are not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future
period. Such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified and you should not place undue reliance
thereon.

Moreover, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA is included for, among other periods, the 53-week period ended
May 30, 2021. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 is calculated on
the basis of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 and adding adjustments
relating to COVID 19 which are calculated by replacing the results of operations for January 2021
(£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million)
and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively. Financial information for the 53-week period ended May 30,
2021 is based on management accounts and is included for illustrative purposes only, has not been reviewed or
audited and may not be reflective of the actual results for such periods and should not be regarded as a
substitute for the audited consolidated financial data of the Parent or financial data prepared in accordance
with IFRS.

We have also included 52-week IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA as of May 30, 2021. IAS 17
Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is calculated on the basis of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA for


-----

the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and applying additional adjustments to give effect
increases in profitability and volume in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, the our International Vehicle
Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying division, as well as the decrease in IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA
for our Automotive Services division, in the period from February 22, 2021 to May 30, 2021. IAS 17 Pro
Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is included for illustrative purposes only and, as a run rate calculation
giving full year effect to the most recent three month period, is likely to differ from actual results for the
period. In particular, this run rate calculation does not give effect to seasonal variances or any impact of
changes in longer term demand dynamics. See “Summary Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures,”
“Operating and Financial Review—COVID 19” and “Operating and Financial Review—Seasonality.”

In addition, we have included certain unaudited aggregated financial information for the 52-week period
ended March 29, 2020. The unaudited aggregated financial information is derived by adding together the
unaudited consolidated income statement information of BCA Marketplace for the 219-day period from and
including April 1, 2019 to and including November 5, 2019 and the consolidated income statement
information of the Parent for the 42-week period from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29,
2020 (which includes the 145-day post-CA Acquisition trading result from November 6, 2019 up to and
including March 29, 2020). The financial information used in presenting such information includes
information for the Parent from June 10, 2019 (the date of incorporation of the Parent), which overlaps with
information of BCA Marketplace from April 1, 2019. However, the Parent was formed on June 10, 2019 for
the purposes of facilitating the CA Acquisition, which was consummated on November 6, 2019 and the
Parent did not trade prior to November 6, 2019. Moreover, while both the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated
Financial Statements and the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS, they relate to different entities that have not prepared their financial information on a consistent basis.
Such unaudited aggregated financial information is included for illustrative purposes only and does not
purport to represent what our income statement would have been if the CA Acquisition had occurred on
April 1, 2019 and is not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period.

The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of
the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None of the adjustments, estimates or
run rate calculations have been audited by any independent auditors and should not be considered indicative
of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment,
estimate or calculation been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future
consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those
presented for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees._**

We are, and following the issuance of the Notes, will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of March 28, 2021,
after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, our primary financing arrangements will be the Notes, the
Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility, and we would have
had £1,760 million of Adjusted Total Debt (which excludes finance leases and borrowing under the
Receivables Facility). See “Capitalization”and “Description of Other Financial Arrangements.”In addition, as
of March 28, 2021, we had borrowings in an amount of £148.3 million under the Receivables Facility.

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions, including an economic downturn due to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest
and amortization costs on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund the
payment of principal of indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or
other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;


-----

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our high level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which_**
**_could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture, the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions,
and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those
restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second
Lien Facility Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that would not constitute indebtedness
under these agreements.

**_The debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement will bear interest at a_**
**_floating rate that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and debt and reducing our cash flow._**

Borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum
equal to the Sterling Over Night Index Average risk-free rate (“SONIA”) (in respect of pound sterling), the
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) (in respect of euro) and the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) (in respect of any other applicable currency), subject in each case to a zero floor, plus an agreed
margin. Borrowings under the Second Lien Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest
per annum equal to SONIA, subject to a zero floor, plus an agreed margin. SONIA, EURIBOR and LIBOR
could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements
designed to fix a portion of these benchmark interest rates in the future, there can be no assurances that
hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging
arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the
debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, to the extent not fixed
by means of hedging arrangements, would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to be
published as panel bank rates after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all currencies will cease as
panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when regulatory reform may, in the future,
cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar floating rate market is currently expected to
transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, a floating rate equal to compounding overnight Secured
Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve in the United States plus a spread adjustment, by
not later than the time that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate, although
other alternative rates may also be used. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently
than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a
material adverse effect on our debt linked to such a benchmark. Regulatory requirements under the EU
Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation
(particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or
contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or
methodologies used for the benchmark; or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled
cessation of the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or
publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions
by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which the relevant
benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other
consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives
may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse
effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to such benchmark and on our ability to
service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_The Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent that does not have any revenue generating operations of its_**
**_own and depends on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that was incorporated to facilitate the offering of the Notes and has no
business operations or material assets other than its rights under the Proceeds Loan Agreement. The Issuer
will be dependent upon payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement and cash flow from our operating
companies to meet its obligations under the Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order for the
Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes principally through payments made pursuant to the Proceeds
Loan Agreement, the provisions of intercompany loans, dividends and other distributions. If entities within
our group do not fulfill their obligations under any such intercompany loans and do not otherwise distribute
cash in order for the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other
source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The amount of cash
available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of our operating companies and the
ability of those companies to transfer funds under applicable law. Our operating companies, however, may
not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance loans, directly
or indirectly, to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. In addition, the
entities of our group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the
Notes. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as
dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The inability to transfer
cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in
aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet the obligations under the Notes, they may not be permitted
to make the necessary dividends or distributions from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in
their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, subsidiaries of the Parent will guarantee the Notes. For the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 68% of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA.

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the
Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors
of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our finance facilities and bank financing agreements,
are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made
available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment
in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Guarantor, as a direct or
indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate_**
**_sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This
depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial,
competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these
“Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our
interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay
our obligations as they come due. We also experience seasonal fluctuations in our cash flow. Due to seasonal
trends influencing both vehicle supply and demand, our revenue and operating results have varied, and likely
will continue to vary, from quarter to quarter. For example, used vehicle sales in the UK tend to increase
during vehicle registration plate change periods in March and September of each year. In March, in particular,
new vehicle sales traditionally peak in the UK, and as a result, dealer vendors of the Vehicle Remarketing
division typically experience an increase in part-exchange volumes, which has a subsequent effect of increasing


-----

sales through the Marketplace. Conversely, our revenue typically decreases during the summer and in
December, a seasonality pattern that is followed by sales in both the Vehicle Buying division and the
Automotive Services division. Seasonality can therefore have a negative effect on our cash flow, thereby
impacting our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, including the Notes, and to fund
working capital and capital expenditures.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, that
revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund
our other liquidity needs. In particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID 19
pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to
generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities. See “—Risks Relating to Our Business—The
_COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations,_
_financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is_
_uncertain” and “Operating and Financial Review—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in
a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In
addition, the terms of our debt, including the Indenture and the terms governing the Senior Term Loan
Facility, the Second Lien Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, and any future debt, may limit our ability
to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial
condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to
dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from
such sale would be acceptable.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital_**
**_needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement restrict, among
others, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

- pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem our stock;

- make investments or other restricted payments;

- enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

- transfer or sell assets;

- engage in transactions with affiliates;

- create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

- impair security interests;

- merge or consolidate with or into another company; and

- amend certain documents.

The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital
needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. All of these
limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.

For the restrictions that are included in the Indenture, see “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”For
the restrictions that are included in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement,


-----

see “Description of Other Financial Arrangements.” A breach of covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions
contained in these agreements could result in an event of default under these agreements. In particular, upon
the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility
Agreement, subject to any applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the
relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the relevant facilities and elect to declare all amounts
outstanding under the relevant facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In
addition, any default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement could
lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors accelerate payment of amounts under the
relevant facilities, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient
to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and
payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable
to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure
repayment of those amounts.

We are also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement. In particular,
we are required to comply with a financial covenant to maintain our consolidated senior secured leverage
ratio for each period of twelve months ending on any financial quarter date (the first such financial quarter
ending April 3, 2022) if utilizations thereunder exceed a certain threshold. See “Description of Other Financial
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet these covenants and restrictions can be_
affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them.

In addition, we are subject to certain covenants contained in the Receivables Facility Agreement, including
with respect to financial covenants requiring us to meet certain EBITDA (as such term is defined in the
Receivables Facility Agreement) thresholds. Our ability to satisfy the financial condition in the Receivables
Facility Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will
satisfy such requirements. We are also subject to general undertakings contained in the Receivables Facility
Agreement restricting our ability to, among others, merge with other business entities, enter into certain types
of joint ventures, change our business focus, dispose of certain assets or pay dividends, in each case subject to
exceptions and qualifications.

**_The Notes will not be initially secured by the Additional Collateral and the Additional Guarantors will not initially_**
**_guarantee the Notes and rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, subject to the release of security in respect of the Existing Facilities, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted
Collateral Liens and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be secured only by
the Initial Collateral. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and in any event within two
business days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens
and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Post-Closing Collateral. There can be no
assurance that collateral in respect of the Existing Facilities will be released on the Issue Date and that we will
be successful in procuring the Post-Closing Collateral within the time period specified, the failure of which
would result in an event of default under the Indenture. In addition to the Notes, the Collateral will also
secure borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility and the Revolving Credit
Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Furthermore, the Additional Guarantors are only required to guarantee the Notes within two business days
of the Issue Date.

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect
to the claims under the Notes, if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens.
We may not be able to perfect any such security interests. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection
with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral.
Perfection of the security interests in the Collateral, especially the Post-Closing Collateral, after the Issue
Date increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests become avoided or subject to the liens
of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the
Collateral may also result in the invalidity or the lack of effectiveness of the relevant security interest or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a


-----

trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. The Trustee
and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect,
or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will be granted as_**
**_security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees._**

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. See
“Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral
will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to
provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the
Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be
substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.

The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the
event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic
conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the
fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a
going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily
liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates.
Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing
to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral
should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be
saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests
and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those
parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security
interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security
Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of
Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors (to the extent not repaid from the
proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition,
there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, or at all.

Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must be applied to
repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Indenture and the Notes
as well as borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility, the Revolving Credit
Facility, certain hedging obligations, if any, and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors
permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement. In addition, the Indenture allows incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future
that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt
secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral.

To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture,
the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and other rights encumber the Collateral
securing the Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose
on the Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others,
the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of
certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response


-----

to the COVID 19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or
limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Collateral.

The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the
consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be
able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given
when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the
ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

In addition, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty enforcing or be
entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in
bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in, and/or priority with respect to, the same
Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency and Local Law Limitations.”

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the
Notes. Subject to the Security Documents, so long as no default or event of default under the Indenture or a
continuing acceleration event under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement
would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among others, without any release or consent by
the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including
repayments of indebtedness.

**_The security interests in the Collateral are granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_**
**_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes but
are granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that
only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of
the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.

**_The incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured by the
Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods (i.e. the periods of time following the granting of security
interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in
England and Wales and Jersey), as the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor
of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness.
The applicable hardening periods for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security
interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or perfected were to be
enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce such security interest. The same rights also apply in
connection with the accession of subsidiaries as additional Guarantors to the Notes and the granting of
security interests over their respective assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

**_Each Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_**
**_to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Indenture provides that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that
Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each
Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Certain Insolvency and Local Law
_Limitations.”_


-----

Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to
Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and
defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital,
thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or
decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.
Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit
the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In addition, the laws, regulations or other
governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID 19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a
moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of
the Guarantees.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other
laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee,
(ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor
or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you,
typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the
granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware
that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the
relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant
Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best
interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted
under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to
the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was insolvent
at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor
was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted
preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or improper corporate distribution on other grounds, or that
a court would not otherwise set aside such Guarantee.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such
Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution
on other grounds or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court
will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that
the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court were to decide that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper
corporate distribution on other grounds and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other
reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of
the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which remains valid and
enforceable. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent
the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all
liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any
Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on
other grounds or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Notes.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your_**
**_consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including:

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes issued under the Indenture
or discharge or defeasance thereof;

- upon release of a Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);

- in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person; provided that if the Collateral is disposed to
the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the relevant Collateral becomes immediately subject to a substantially
equivalent lien in favor of the Security Agent securing the Notes (but excluding any transaction subject to
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent”);
_provided, further, that, in each case, such disposition is permitted by the Indenture;_

- if the Parent designates any Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary (as such terms are defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions);

- in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured
indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or otherwise in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement;

- as may be permitted by the covenant described under “Description of _the Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest;”_

- in connection with an IPO Pushdown (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions), as
specified in the Indenture; and

- in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the
covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.”

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

- in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of capital stock of the relevant Guarantor or of a holding company thereof, such that such
Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case in a transaction
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

- in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the relevant
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and
“Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only (other than a Subsidiary Guarantee issued on the Issue Date), to
the extent that the relevant Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Guarantees and
_Collateral,” upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge of indebtedness referred to in such_
paragraph;

- in the case of any Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the provisions
described under Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown;”

- upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;
or

- in connection with certain enforcement actions pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of Other Financial Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.”

**_English and Jersey insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than bankruptcy laws of other_**
**_jurisdictions you are familiar with._**

The Issuer and certain entities of our group, including the Parent and most of the other Guarantors, are
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any


-----

of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law. In addition,
H.I.J. Limited is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to
such entity would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, the laws of Jersey. English or Jersey
insolvency laws are not identical to, and insolvency outcomes may vary from, the laws of the United States or
other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the
Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
insolvency or similar proceedings or whether English/Jersey insolvency laws would be favorable to your
interests.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any future guarantors, if any, were to
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Any Guarantees
and Collateral provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this Offering Memorandum are
also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the
Guarantees or security interests after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be
subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The
insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with,
each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential
transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of
the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether
any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the
Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain
_Insolvency and Local Law Limitations.”_

**_Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain Guarantees and Collateral may be released, any retaken Collateral may be_**
**_subject to hardening periods, and U.S. holders may have U.S. federal income tax consequences._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as defined under “Description of the
_Notes—IPO Pushdown”). Upon consummation of the IPO Pushdown, references to the Parent and its_
restricted subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown
Entity (as defined under “Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown”) and its restricted subsidiaries from time
to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity. Upon such substitution, each Holding Company (as
defined under “Description of the Notes”) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all obligations under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Guarantees or
security granted by such Holding Company in respect of the Indenture and the Notes will be released. In such
a case, new security documents in respect of collateral to be retaken and that will remain in place following an
IPO Pushdown may need to be executed and be subject to new hardening periods.

In addition, the IPO Pushdown may result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, depending upon the specific circumstances of the IPO Pushdown, and may have tax consequences
for U.S. holders, including recognition of gain or loss on such deemed exchange. See “Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—IPO Pushdown.”_

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Indenture contains provisions relating to certain events constituting a Change of Control (as defined
under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will
be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of
control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that
we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or
that the restrictions in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Second
Lien Facility Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such
required repurchases. A change of control may result in a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit
Facility and a right to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the
Second Lien Facility. The exercise of the right of holders of the Notes to require the repurchase of the Notes
upon a change of control could cause a default under our debt documents, even if the change of control itself
does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from entities of our group to allow it to pay cash to the
holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then-existing
financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If
an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the


-----

Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such
indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited
from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain third-party
financing to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or make an offer to repurchase the Notes
upon a change of control. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default
under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Second Lien Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture will
permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be
required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and
may not receive the return expected.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift
in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control (as
defined under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Additionally, there are certain exceptions to
the definition of “Change of Control”which allow changes in the ownership of the Issuer if certain conditions
are satisfied, including if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with
such Change of Control on one occasion. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or_
redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

In the event the Parent is sold to a new investor, whether or not such sale constitutes a change of control under
the Indenture, no assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current
business and financial strategy. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

The definition of “Change of Control”in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the Parent’s and
its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive
Investment Grade Status (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) and no default
or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the following provisions of the
Indenture will not apply to the Notes: “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,”_
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary_
_Stock,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “Description of_
_the Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees and Collateral” and the provisions of clause (3) of the_
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent”
and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to such Notes should
subsequently decline to below “Baa3” or “BBB,” as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as
at and from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur
additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, without restrictions under the Notes
which may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.


-----

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with the provisions described under “Description
_of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor_
who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a
comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_If certain changes to tax law were to occur, we would have the option to redeem the Notes._**

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “Description of the
_Notes—Additional Amounts”) affecting taxation become effective that would impose withholding taxes or_
other deductions on the payments on the Notes or the Guarantees, we may redeem the Notes in whole, but
not in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. We are unable to determine whether such
developments affecting taxation will be enacted, but if such change do occur, the Notes will be redeemable at
our option.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining
the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed in this section of this
Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors” and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will be assigned
at all, or that any credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not
be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so
warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one
or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings
and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.
Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or
definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes unless
and until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or
its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be
made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream that hold book-entry
interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment
to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, any other paying agent or any registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of
the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or
to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely
on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights
and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or
requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including enforcement of security for the
Notes and the Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common
depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act
directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or,
if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely
basis.


-----

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed on the
Exchange and admitted to dealing on the Official List thereof and to maintain such listing as long as the
Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer
cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it
becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such
listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as
a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable
issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from
the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a
material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment
grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities
similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general
decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The
trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes
may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may
have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.
As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although
no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange being granted, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not
for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official
List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the
secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture allows us to issue additional notes in the future, which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”

**_The interests of the holders of the Notes and additional notes issued under the Indenture from time to time may_**
**_be inconsistent._**

The Notes will be issued pursuant to a single Indenture. Subject to certain restrictions, further series of
additional notes may be issued under the Indenture which may have different terms in respect of currency,
interest rate and certain other matters. Accordingly, holders of such additional notes may have interests that
differ from the holders of other series of notes issued under the Indenture, including the Notes. However,
holders of such additional notes will generally vote as a single class with holders of other series of notes issued
under the Indenture, including the Notes, with respect to amendments, waivers or other modifications of the
Indenture. Accordingly, to the extent any amendment, waiver or modification is approved by the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture (subject to the
limited exceptions), all holders of Notes under the Indenture will be bound by such amendment, waiver or
modification.

**_Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S. federal income_**
**_tax purposes._**

Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable series of notes previously
issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.


-----

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Consequences”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of_
Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal
income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with
respect to the potential issuance of additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial
Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which, nevertheless, are not capable
of being separately identified.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued,
without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry
Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that
hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such
Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note, if any,
representing Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers” and
_“Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”_

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the
United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the
Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and
their business is conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and
the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to
the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under
the Indenture, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because the assets of the Issuer and the
Guarantors and the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States,
you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent
decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil
liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the TIA._**

The Indenture with respect to the Notes offered hereby is not required to be, nor will it be, qualified under the
U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or include or be subject to
any of the provisions of the TIA. Consequently, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the protections
provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those
respecting preferential collections by the Trustee or conflicting interests of the Trustee. See “Description of the
_Notes.”_

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in pound sterling. An investment in the Notes denominated in a
currency other than the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments will entail
foreign exchange related risks due to, among others, possible significant changes in the value of the pound
sterling relative to other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the pound sterling against other relevant currencies could cause a decrease
in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the
return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your
investments. In addition, an investment in the Notes by U.S. investors may have significant tax consequences.
See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”


-----

**_Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our independent auditor._**

See “Independent Auditor” for a description of the reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), our
independent auditor, including language limiting their scope of responsibility in relation to their audit work.
Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against PwC.

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, PwC’s reports included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum each states that the relevant report has been prepared for and only for the Parent’s members as
a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose and that
PwC will does not accept responsibility or liability in respect of the report to any party save where expressly
agreed by its prior consent in writing.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus
used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under
the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the
recourse that investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have against PwC based on its reports or the
directors’ reports and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which PwC
may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions,
including the United Kingdom. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the
ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against PwC for damages arising out of an investment in or
purchase of the Notes.

**Risk Related to Ownership**

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the holders of the Notes._**

TDR Capital indirectly beneficially owns approximately 74% of the outstanding shares of the Parent. As a
result, TDR Capital is able to control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and
removal of our directors, our corporate and management policies, potential mergers or acquisitions, payment
of dividends, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of TDR Capital may differ
from yours in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our
debts as they mature, the interests of TDR Capital, as ultimate majority shareholder, may be in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity
investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the Notes. TDR Capital
has no contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business
if we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indenture permits us to pay management fees, dividends or
make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and TDR Capital may have an interest in our
doing so. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

Furthermore, TDR Capital and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and
may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly and indirectly with us, or
with which we conduct business. TDR Capital and their affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities
that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
available to us. You should consider that the interests of these holders may differ from yours in material
respects. See “Principal Shareholders” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

**Overview**

We operate leading digital used vehicle marketplaces (both business to business (“B2B”) and consumer to
business (“C2B”)) in the UK and B2B marketplaces in continental Europe and are a leading provider of
associated automotive services, including vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet
management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. We have physical presence in 10 countries
across the UK and continental Europe as well as unmatched sourcing, data, technology and logistics
capabilities. As of March 28, 2021, our business comprises:

- a leading B2B digital used vehicle marketplace across the UK and continental Europe, which facilitated the
sale of approximately 1.5 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 1.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year
2021;

- a leading C2B digital used vehicle marketplace in the UK, WeBuyAnyCar, with sold volumes of 321,000
vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, reflecting the COVID 19
restrictions on the business that now has an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in
March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period); and

- a leading automotive logistics service business in the UK, which moved more than 2.8 million vehicles in
the UK in the fiscal year 2020 and 2.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021, and stored, refurbished and
processed more than 950,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 675,000 in the fiscal year 2021.

We estimate that for the fiscal year 2020 we came in contact with approximately one in every three vehicles in
the UK (approximately 29 million touch points, of which approximately 13 million were unique vehicles out
of a vehicle parc of approximately 41 million, and including approximately 24 million digital touch points).
Through our digital used vehicle marketplaces (the “Marketplace”), we are a critical liquidity provider to the
used vehicles market across the UK and continental Europe, matching the complex requirements of both
vendors and buyers and also facilitating the purchase of individual vehicles from consumers. The Marketplace
facilitates speedy disposal of high volumes of vehicles and offers a broad range of consistently graded vehicle
stock, thereby providing efficiency, liquidity (i.e., fast disposal of vehicle stock) and choice. Moreover, we are
the UK’s leading provider of automotive services solutions.

By providing a full suite of auction and automotive services, we offer our customers solutions for almost all
stages of the vehicle life-cycle, beginning as soon as the new car arrives at the port. Our scope of services
provides synergistic benefits across our divisions, as our vehicle sales platforms, together with our automotive
services solutions, generate vehicle and pricing data used in both our vehicle remarketing and vehicle buying
operations.


-----

Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, we have accelerated our digital transition and now transact digitally
almost 100% of our volumes through online channels. We integrate our digital and physical assets to provide
innovative multi-service solutions, maximizing speed, intelligence and performance across our comprehensive
offerings. In the fiscal year 2021, 100% (2020: 37%) of our auction volumes in the UK Vehicle Remarketing
division and 96% (2020: 84%) of our auction volumes in the International Vehicle Remarketing division were
transacted online, which is a testament to our successful shift towards a predominantly digital online business
model moving forward.

In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, we generated £253.1 million of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA,
as compared to £232.8 million, £204.1 million and £174.4 million in the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019,
respectively.

We operate through three main business lines: (i) the B2B Marketplace business line, which is comprised of
our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying
division’s operations in continental Europe, (ii) the C2B Marketplace business line, which is WeBuyAnyCar,
our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, and (iii) the Automotive Services business line, which is
accounted for in our Automotive Services division.

- B2B Marketplace: B2B Marketplace is our core business that facilitates the exchange of used vehicles
between vendors and buyers through primarily digital auctions. As of March 28, 2021, our digital auctions
are supported by 21 physical sites in the UK (23 as of June 1, 2021) and 30 physical sites in continental
Europe at which vehicles are stored, inspected, repaired and refurbished.

B2B Marketplace (which excludes WeBuyAnyCar) does not take title to the majority of vehicles that it sells,
but instead serves as an agent between vendor and buyer and recognizes revenues through auction transaction
fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical pre- and post- auction services such as
inspections, appraisals, repairs, refurbishment, imaging, storage and handling. We also purchase vehicles
directly from certain corporate vendors under outsourced remarketing contracts, whereby we directly buy our
vendors’ inventory and have discretion over the remarketing channel through which we sell the vehicle. B2B
Marketplace takes title to such vehicles until the time of resale and recognizes revenues for the full sale value
of the vehicle less the cost of acquisition. Vehicles acquired pursuant to outsourced remarketing contracts are
typically resold within 15 to 30 days of acquisition and in turn generate additional revenue above the auction
fees.

B2B Marketplace also includes our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, which is
focused on purchasing batches of vehicles primarily from corporates in continental Europe.

In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division generated £90.5 million
of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £116.3 million; 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019: £109.4 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division
sold approximately 867,000 vehicles (2020: 1,063,000 vehicles; 2019: 1,030,0000 vehicles). In the 52-week
period ended March 28, 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division generated £29.2 million of IAS
17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £34.2 million; 52-week period ended
March 31, 2019: £33.7 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division sold
approximately 334,000 vehicles (2020: 401,000 vehicles; 2019: 388,000 vehicles).

- C2B Marketplace: C2B Marketplace is our C2B vehicle buying business which operates in the UK through
WeBuyAnyCar. WeBuyAnyCar purchases used vehicles directly from consumers, leveraging its proprietary
online pricing quotation systems and efficient physical inspection processes to facilitate purchases from
such consumers. WeBuyAnyCar has carried out a total of 2.2 million vehicle purchases since its inception
in 2006, and in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar recorded more than 22 million unique
visitors to its website and performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online. As of March 28, 2021,
WeBuyAnyCar operates in 357 locations across the UK, which are located within an average drive time of
under 14 minutes to customers. In addition, WeBuyAnyCar offers swift services to its consumers, allowing
them to obtain a quote in under 60 seconds and to then subsequently receive monies for the purchase of
their vehicle within 30 minutes of the sale being concluded.

C2B Marketplace remarkets the vehicles it purchases exclusively through B2B Marketplace within
approximately 10 days and accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division in
the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This allows us to actively manage the volumes and mix on the
Marketplace, while helping to de-risk the supply of vehicles to the auction.


-----

C2B Marketplace’s consistent and growing profitability over the past years demonstrates our ability to
generate “metal margin” (accounted for in our Vehicle Buying division) on C2B vehicles in addition to core
auction buyer fees (accounted for in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division). Vehicles sourced via our C2B
Marketplace therefore result in higher profitability per vehicle for the CA Group. Our sophisticated and
proprietary pricing mechanism and real-time market data enable us to more accurately price the purchase of
vehicles to generate a profitable onward sale. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Vehicle Buying
division generated £44.0 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29,
2020: £27.7 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £24.1 million), which was predominantly generated
through C2B Marketplace (i.e., WeBuyAnyCar).

- Automotive Services: Automotive Services provides vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery
inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. With our refurbishment
offering (which has a 250,000 yearly vehicle refurbishment capacity), we are able to bring vehicles to either
wholesale standard or a “Retail Ready” standard (which refers to vehicles that are cosmetically and
mechanically prepared to be immediately placed for sale to end consumers and are therefore particularly
attractive to online car dealers). These standards increase prices achieved at auction and render it simpler
for dealers to on-sell the vehicle to consumers. We seek to develop a relationship with vendors and endeavor
to act as a one-stop shop for vehicles throughout the majority of their lifecycle, expanding our revenue
streams along the value chain and also positioning ourselves to be the preferred provider of remarketing
services when the vehicles come off lease or roll out of the fleet. Our overall infrastructure and logistics
network allow us to efficiently cover all key locations and major transport hubs in the UK. Automotive
Services helps maximize the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies derived from the
wide-ranging scope of services offered, benefitting both our customers as well as our own operations.

Automotive Services generates revenue in the form of service fees. In the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, Automotive Services generated £12.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period
ended March 29, 2020: £22.6 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £19.1 million).

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

The COVID 19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations.
In addition, our revenue and profits are largely dependent on the supply of vehicles to the Vehicle Remarketing
and Vehicle Buying divisions, the demand for vehicles sold by the Vehicle Remarketing divisions and the
availability of vehicles which require services provided by the Automotive Services division. Our results of
operations are further impacted by our acquisitions, seasonality and currency translation. Below is a detailed
discussion of each of these factors affecting our results of operations.

**_COVID 19_**

_General Impact_

Due to the unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers,
leasing companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private
consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace
were significantly reduced during the fiscal year 2021 with average weekly trading volume dipping to 4,000 at
the start of the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021, compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year 2020. The changes in operating environment spurred by the COVID 19 pandemic have
accelerated our shift towards a fully digital online business model with increased focus on the functionality
and usability of our digital platforms, as a result of which we were able to earn new contracts and increase our
market share in spite of the challenging market conditions. The scale of the transformation is demonstrated
by the fiscal year 2021 ending with 100% of UK auction sales having occurred online, compared to 37% in the
fiscal year 2020.

In addition to the enforced cessation of physical auctions in the UK, we faced restrictions such as site closures
impacting the operation of the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate and recorded a reduction in the movement and
inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. Our customers evolved their business models, for example
by motor dealers operating a click-and-collect process during 2020 to be able to better deal with social
distancing restrictions and, by August 2020, average weekly trading volumes recovered to 31,000. With the
continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries, and the UK in particular, as well as
governments lifting restrictions to public life, we expect the demand for our services increase. The shift towards
a more digital operation model has, to an extent, mitigated the impact of COVID 19 and the lifting of
COVID 19 restrictions is expected to increase demand in the long term as dealers look to restock their
inventory.

equivalents of £113.2 million and £247.2 million as of March 28, 2021 and March 29, 2020, respectively.

_Measures Taken in Response to the COVID 19 Pandemic_

We have been and actively continue to monitor the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our operations, and
our priority has been the safety of our employees and other stakeholders. As governments in the jurisdictions
where we operate introduced restrictions at the outset of the COVID 19 pandemic, we quickly ceased physical
auctions and introduced social distancing and other modifications to our ways of working to remain
compliant. In response to the closure of our physical auction sites, we adopted swift measures to significantly
reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of
maximizing our liquidity position. Specifically, we adopted the following measures, which were only necessary
during the time of the first lockdown in the UK during March 2020 to July 2020 and were not implemented
during the subsequent second and third lockdowns:

- successfully negotiated with debtors and creditors on payment terms;

- put on hold all non-essential and discretionary spend within the business, including any growth,
expansionary or investment capital expenditures and increased controls around the cash disbursement
process, including sign off by senior members of the finance team for any payments in excess of certain
reduced thresholds;

- negotiated tax deferrals with HMRC in respect of VAT and employment taxes; and

- entered into arrangements with landlords to defer rent payments during the period of closure and took
rates relief where available.

We also made furlough arrangements for those staff unable to work in the UK where we furloughed as much
as 80% of our staff at the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020 and, in parallel, applied for employee
salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in continental Europe. Such schemes allow
companies to place employees on paid leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s
ordinary salary being partially reimbursed by the respective government. As of March 28, 2021, approximately
4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 furlough
income across all jurisdictions totaled £35.5 million and rates relief totaled £8.3 million. As of March 28,
2021, remaining deferrals comprise VAT deferrals of £15.8 million, which are expected to be settled in full in
instalments during the fiscal year 2022. As a result of the numerous cost-cutting and transitory measures
taken at the beginning of the first lockdown in the UK, we came out of that lockdown with greater liquidity
compared to our liquidity going into such lockdown. From the end of the first lockdown in the UK, we have
managed to remain positive in terms of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA even in periods with government
restrictions comparable with the first lockdown in the UK. Given the success of our digital offering with our
clients and the level of profitability and efficiency achieved, we currently have no intention of reverting back
to our previous predominantly physical auction model.

_Impairment Review_

As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including
£938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA Acquisition. While goodwill impairment is tested annually, the
COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business constituted an impairment indicator that we assessed
with respect to all intangible assets as well as goodwill. The impairment review is performed on a “value-inuse” basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will
occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth rate. Any impairment charge is then recognized
in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable
amount. As a result of our impairment review conducted as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, we
recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment relating to the CA Acquisition in the amount of £266.4 million


-----

in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge thereby specifically represented a change
in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the
Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Business—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our_
_business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the_
_COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.” We caution you that these impairment charges should not be regarded as_
an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding impairment charges for any
future period. See “Forward-looking Statements.”

**_Seasonality_**

Due to seasonal trends influencing both vehicle supply and demand, our revenue and operating results have
varied, and likely will continue to vary, from quarter to quarter. For example, used vehicle sales in the UK
tend to increase during vehicle registration plate change periods in March and September of each year. In
March, in particular, new vehicle sales traditionally peak in the UK, and as a result, dealer vendors of the
Vehicle Remarketing division typically experience an increase in part-exchange volumes, which has a
subsequent effect of increasing sales through the Marketplace. Conversely, our revenue typically decreases
during the summer and in December, a seasonality pattern that is followed by sales in both the Vehicle Buying
division and the Automotive Services division. As a result of these fluctuations, our revenue tends to be lowest
in the quarter ending in December and highest in the quarter ending March. In addition, there is a reduced
level of activity during the Christmas and New Year holiday period.

**_Currency Translation_**

We report our results in pound sterling, and pound sterling is also the functional currency of our UK
operations. However, we conduct operations in the UK and continental Europe, as a result of which
approximately 11% of our revenue in the fiscal year 2021 was denominated in currencies other than pound
sterling, with the significant majority of this denominated in euro. We also conduct a limited number of
transactions in a small number of other currencies.

Exchange rates between the pound sterling and the euro have ranged from €1.1605 per pound sterling on
March 31, 2019 to €1.1176 per pound sterling on March 29, 2020 and €1.1691 per pound sterling on March 28,
2021. Typically, our costs in a currency other than the pound sterling are matched by corresponding revenue
in that same currency. Our results of operations may nevertheless be affected by the translation effects of
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on converting the results of these operations reported in currencies
other than the pound sterling to sterling for group consolidation.

**Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Fiscal Year Accounting Periods_**

Our fiscal year accounting periods typically run from the calendar day following the previous fiscal year end
to a Sunday within seven days of March 31. For the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the relevant Sundays
were March 28, 2021, March 29, 2020 and March 31, 2019. While the Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial
Statements and the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the 52-week period ended
March 28, 2021 (from and including March 30, 2020 to and including March 28, 2021) and the 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019 (from and including April 2, 2018 to and including March 31, 2019), respectively,
the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements only comprise the 42-week period ended March 29,
2020 (from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020). As such, the Fiscal Year 2020
Consolidated Financial Statements are not comparable to the other Consolidated Financial Statements since
they only cover the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, representing the period from the incorporation
date of the Parent on June 10, 2019.

In addition, due to the CA Acquisition, which completed on November 6, 2019, the Fiscal Year 2020
Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect our trading results during the period from April 1, 2019 to
November 5, 2019. Below is an overview of the trading history covered by the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

- The Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of BCA
Marketplace and its subsidiaries from and including April 2, 2018 to and including March 31, 2019.
Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 52 weeks of trading,
reflecting our results of operations prior to the CA Acquisition.


-----

- The Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent and
Constellation Automotive (which were incorporated for the purpose of facilitating the CA Acquisition
and, as such, are holding companies with no operations and no assets other than the shares held) from and
including the date of incorporation of the Parent on June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020.
During the period from June 10, 2019 to the completion date of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019,
the Parent had no activities and had very limited financial results to report. Following the consummation
of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019, our financial results are consolidated at the Parent level.
Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 145 days of trading,
reflecting our results of operations after the CA Acquisition.

- The Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent
group from and including March 30, 2020 to and including March 28, 2021. Accordingly, the Fiscal Year
2021 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 52 weeks of trading.

**_Cinch_**

During the fiscal year 2020, we incurred certain start-up costs with respect to cinch, which was sold to an
affiliate of a parent company of the Parent in September 2020. Accordingly, the financial information included
in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020 Predecessor
Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not be comparable
insofar as they relate to cinch across these periods.

**_Application of IFRS 16_**

IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full fiscal year commencing on
or after that date. Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 since the fiscal year 2020. We have adopted IFRS 16
under the modified retrospective approach on April 1, 2019, with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16
recognized on adoption as an adjustment to opening equity. Under this approach, comparative information
for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have
been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020
Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not be
comparable insofar as they relate to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases).

Following the CA Acquisition, a purchase price allocation exercise was undertaken in order to identify the
fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired thereunder, in line with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations).
IFRS 3 requires the revaluation of IFRS 16 right of use assets and lease liabilities using a revised incremental
borrowing rate (“IBR”). The IBR we used for these purposes increased significantly following the CA
Acquisition as a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection therewith. Due to the significant change in
IBR used for the valuation of right of use assets and lease liabilities resulting from the CA Acquisition, the
full year IFRS 16 depreciation and interest included in our Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information
represents the aggregation of (i) the pre-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and interest calculated with
reference to the original, pre-CA Acquisition IBR and (ii) the post-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and
interest calculated with reference to the revised, post-CA Acquisition IBR. Accordingly, the financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
2020 Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not
be comparable.

**Description of Key Income Statement Line Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue consists of revenue attributable to the Vehicle Remarketing division, the Vehicle Buying division and
the Automotive Services division. Revenue from the Vehicle Remarketing division predominantly represents
transaction fees earned from vehicles sold, as well as revenue from value-added services. This also includes the
proceeds from the sale of some vehicles sold under outsourced remarketing contracts where we obtain control
and take legal title to certain vehicles, and interest and loan origination fees earned in respect of vehicle
finance. Revenue from the Vehicle Buying division comprises the proceeds from the sale through the Vehicle
Remarketing division of vehicles purchased from members of the public as well as expedited payment fees.
Revenue from the Automotive Services division comprises fees charged in relation to automotive transport,
refurbishment, storage and fulfilment services.


-----

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales for the Vehicle Remarketing division primarily comprises the costs of providing auction related
services and includes the cost of the vehicle purchased, where we take control and legal title. For the Vehicle
Buying division, cost of sales primarily comprises the cost of the vehicle purchased, as well as the labor and
site costs of the purchasing locations and labor costs of the disposals team, net of transaction fees charged on
each vehicle purchased. Costs of sales for the Automotive Services division primarily comprises the costs
incurred in providing services to customers, including labor, equipment and parts.

**_Operating Costs_**

Operating costs consists of all costs included in operating profit that are not included in cost of sales.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains on finance
balances.

**_Finance Costs_**

Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, direct transaction costs, unwinding of the discount
on provisions and lease liabilities, net interest cost of defined benefit pension arrangements and foreign
exchange losses on finance balances.

**_Share of Loss of Equity-accounted Investments_**

Share of loss of equity-accounted investments comprises our losses in relation to our share of profits or losses
from entities where we have significant influence but not control or joint control, which is generally the case
where we hold between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.

**_Income Tax (Charge)/Benefit_**

Income tax (charge)/benefit is based on the profit/(loss) before income tax for the period and takes into
account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation
and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognized, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not been
reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by IAS 12 (Income Taxes), for example tax
losses where there is no expectation those losses can be utilized.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by £1,993.4 million from £1,460.6 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to
£3,454.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, primarily as a result of the longer trading
period captured in the results for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (i.e., 52 weeks) compared to the
42-week period ended March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days) as a result of the CA Acquisition. Revenue in the UK
Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £762.9 million, from
£546.0 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £1,308.9 million for the 52-week period ended
March 28, 2021. Revenue in the International Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue)
increased by £111.3 million, from £78.8 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £190.1 million
for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Revenue in the Vehicle Buying division (excluding interdivision revenue) increased by £982.9 million, from £682.4 million for the 42-week period ended March 29,
2020 to £1,665.3 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Revenue in the Automotive Services
division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £135.2 million, or 88.2%, from £153.3 million for the
42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £288.5 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Each
of these increases was primarily due to the longer trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal
year 2020 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition. In addition, while revenue was heavily


-----

impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic with various levels of regional and national restrictions in the UK and
our continental European locations, we have only seen a marginal impact on revenue from the COVID 19
pandemic during the fiscal year 2020.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £1,747.1 million, from £1,260.7 million for the 42-week period ended March 29,
2020 to £3,007.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the
longer trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 as described above as a result of
the CA Acquisition.

_Operating Costs_

Operating costs decreased by £94.3 million, or 19.1%, from £493.1 million for the 42-week period ended
March 29, 2020 to £398.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This decrease was primarily
due to a significant goodwill impairment in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, offset by the longer
trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 as described above as a result of the CA
Acquisition.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by £22.6 million, from £0.4 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to
£23.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily due to foreign
exchange profit primarily recognized on retranslation of euro-denominated indebtedness.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by £44.5 million, or 75.6%, from £58.9 million for the 42-week period ended March 29,
2020 to £103.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the
longer trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 as described above as a result of
the CA Acquisition and the post-CA Acquisition financing structure.

_Share of Loss of Equity-accounted Investments_

Share of loss of equity-accounted investments increased by £1.2 million, from £0.1 million for the 42-week
period ended March 29, 2020 to £1.3 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was
primarily due to the underlying trading performance of the relevant investments.

_Income Tax Charge_

Income tax charge decreased by £30.3 million, from a tax charge of £16.7 million and an effective tax rate of
(4.7%) for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to a tax credit of £13.6 million and an effective tax rate
of 39.6% for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. The changes are primarily due to the underlying
profit before tax in the respective periods. In addition:

- Fiscal Year 2020: The £16.7 million tax charge, on a loss before tax of £351.8 million, arose predominantly
as a result of: (i) the net non-deductible impairment of goodwill of £50.6 million; (ii) net non-deductible
costs associated with the CA Acquisition of £10.0 million; (iii) an increase in the UK tax rate on our
deferred tax assets of £17.6 million; and (iv) a net non-deductible foreign exchange movement of
£4.6 million, which collectively increased the tax charge for the period when compared to the profit before
tax at the UK statutory tax rate. Excluding the effect of these items would give an effective tax rate of
21.4% for the period.

- Fiscal Year 2021: The £13.6 million tax credit, on a loss before tax of £34.3 million, arose predominantly
as a result of: (i) a net non-taxable foreign exchange movement of £4.0 million and £3.8 million from the
payment for group relief for less than 19.0% which increased the tax credit for the period. Excluding the
effect of these items would give an effective tax rate of 13.4% for the period.

_Reported Adjusted EBITDA_

Reported Adjusted EBITDA increased by £125.7 million from £89.1 million for the 42-week period ended
March 29, 2020 to £214.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily


-----

as a result of the shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020
(i.e., 145 days) compared to the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a result of the CA
Acquisition.

_IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA_

IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA increased by £145.6 million from £87.2 million for the 42-week period
ended March 29, 2020, 2019 to £232.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase
was primarily as a result of the shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended
March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days) compared to the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a
result of the CA Acquisition and underlying business growth.

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased by £1,567.4 million, or 51.8%, from £3,028.0 million for the 52-week period ended
March 31, 2019 to £1,460.6 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, primarily as a result of the
shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days)
compared to the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a result of the CA Acquisition.
Revenue in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) decreased by
£696.5 million, or 56.1%, from £1,242.5 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £546.0 million
for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. Revenue in the International Vehicle Remarketing division
(excluding inter-division revenue) decreased by £105.5 million, or 57.2%, from £184.3 million for the 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019 to £78.8 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. Revenue in the
Vehicle Buying division (excluding inter-division revenue) decreased by £537.4 million, or 44.1%, from
£1,219.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £682.4 million for the 42-week period ended
March 29, 2020. Revenue in the Automotive Services division (excluding inter-division revenue) decreased by
£228.1 million, or 59.8%, from £381.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £153.3 million
for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. Each of these decreases was primarily due to the shorter
trading period in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 as described above as a result of the CA
Acquisition.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales decreased by £1,293.4 million, or 50.6%, from £2,554.1 million for the 52-week period ended
March 31, 2019 to £1,260.7 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This decrease was primarily
due to the shorter trading period in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 as described above as
a result of the CA Acquisition.

_Operating Costs_

Operating costs increased by £119.4 million, or 32.0%, from £373.7 million for the 52-week period ended
March 31, 2019 to £493.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This increase was primarily
due to the shorter trading period in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 as described above as
a result of the CA Acquisition and a significant goodwill impairment in the 42-week period ended March 29,
2020 relating to the COVID 19 pandemic.

_Finance Income_

Finance income decreased by £0.1 million, or 20.0%, from £0.5 million for the 52-week period ended
March 31, 2019 to £0.4 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by £47.7 million from £11.2 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to
£58.9 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the post-CA
Acquisition financing structure and the recognition of IFRS 16 interest costs.

_Share of Loss of Equity-accounted Investments_

Share of loss of equity-accounted investments was £0.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020.
No share of loss of equity-accounted investments was recorded in the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019.

_Income Tax Charge_

Income tax charge decreased by £4.2 million, from a tax charge of £20.9 million and an effective tax rate of
23.4% for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to a tax charge of £16.7 million and an effective tax rate
of (4.7%) for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The changes are primarily due to the underlying
profit before tax in the respective periods. In addition:

- Fiscal Year 2020: The £16.7 million tax charge, on a loss before tax of £351.8 million, arose predominantly
as a result of: (i) the net non-deductible impairment of goodwill of £50.6 million; (ii) net non-deductible
costs associated with the CA Acquisition of £10.0 million; (iii) an increase in the UK tax rate on our
deferred tax assets of £17.6 million; and (iv) a net non-deductible foreign exchange movement of
£4.6 million, which collectively increased the tax charge for the period when compared to the profit before


-----

tax at the UK statutory tax rate. Excluding the effect of these items would give an effective tax rate of
21.4% for the period.

- Fiscal Year 2019: Our parent entity was a listed company and the financing structure and costs relating to
significant or non-recurring items was substantially different to the period post the CA Acquisition. The
effective tax rate of 23.4% therefore reflects these structural differences and the differences in tax rates in
the jurisdictions in which we operate.

_Reported Adjusted EBITDA_

Reported Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £82.8 million, or 48.2%, from £171.9 million for the 52-week period
ended March 31, 2019 to £89.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This decrease was
primarily as a result of the shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended
March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days) compared to the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a
result of the CA Acquisition.

_IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA_

IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £87.2 million, or 50.0%, from £174.4 million for the 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019 to £87.2 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This decrease
was primarily as a result of the shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended
March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days) compared to the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a
result of the CA Acquisition.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by £367.7 million, or 21.9%, from £1,676.3 million for the 210-day period ended
October 28, 2018 to £2,044.0 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. Revenue in the UK
Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £155.8 million, or 23.1%, from
£675.3 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £831.1 million for the 219-day period ended
November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to growth in outsourced remarketing contracts and
increased supply of vehicles, particularly from the Vehicle Buying division. Revenue in the International
Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £21.0 million, or 20.8%, from
£101.2 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £122.2 million for the 219-day period ended
November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased sold volumes and an increase in transport
and export services. Revenue in the Vehicle Buying division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by
£159.0 million, or 23.1%, from £688.4 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £847.4 million
for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased volume of
vehicles purchased and the continuing refinement of the valuation process. Revenue in the Automotive
Services division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £31.9 million, or 15.1%, from £211.4 million
for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £243.3 million for the 219-day period ended November 5,
2019. This increase was primarily due to the supply of vehicles returning to expected levels, increased
opportunities for higher value refurbishment services and the continuing efficiencies resulting from providing
integrated services to the wider CA Group.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £336.1 million, or 24.0%, from £1,402.8 million for the 210-day period ended
October 28, 2018 to £1,738.9 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the increase in activity, as seen in revenue, over the same period.

_Operating Costs_

Operating costs increased by £21.7 million, or 10.1%, from £214.7 million for the 210-day period ended
October 28, 2018 to £236.4 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by £0.8 million from £0.3 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to
£1.1 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by £11.3 million from £5.8 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to
£17.1 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the
recognition of IFRS 16 interest costs.


-----

_Income Tax Charge_

Income tax charge decreased by £1.8 million, or 14.3%, from a tax charge of £12.6 million and an effective tax
rate of 22.7% for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to a tax charge of £10.8 million and an effective
tax rate of 20.5% for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. The changes are primarily due to a net tax
credit in relation to significant or non-recurring items including in relation to amortization of acquired
intangible assets. Despite a lower effective tax rate for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019, the income
tax charge increased primarily as a result of an increased profitability.

_Reported Adjusted EBITDA_

Reported Adjusted EBITDA increased by £37.1 million, or 37.2%, from £99.6 million for the 210-day period
ended October 28, 2018 to £136.7 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to strong performance across all divisions.

_IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA_

IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA increased by £37.1 million, or 37.2%, from £99.6 million for the 210-day
period ended October 28, 2018 to £136.7 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to strong performance across all divisions.

**_Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Unaudited Aggregated 52-week Period ended March 29, 2020_**

Revenue decreased by £50.6 million from £3,504.6 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended
March 29, 2020 to £3,454.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA
decreased by £22.1 million from £190.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29,
2020 to £168.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA
increased by £28.7 million from £204.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29,
2020 to £232.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021.

We commenced the fiscal year 2021 with all markets operating under varying national government restrictions
in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Swift actions were taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, including
furloughing a significant number of employees and utilizing government initiatives to support employment
costs for employees who were not able to contribute to the ongoing operation of the business. Management
also negotiated with landlords to reduce or defer rental payments and temporarily ceased all consumer vehicle
buying activity.

Physical auctions and the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate closed with a resulting reduction in the movement and
inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. During April 2021, all auctions took place on our online
platforms initially populated with vehicles that had been imaged and graded before lockdown. At
commencement of the restrictions, demand was greatest for vehicles at lower price points. Over 90% of the
transporter fleet was taken off the road, with the remaining vehicle moves taking place to support key workers
and provide services to organizations which were not able to cease operations, including for example the
transportation of ambulances for the NHS. Vehicles continued to arrive into the UK by ship, and these
vehicles were received and stored in line with working regulations. Trading was similarly impacted across
continental Europe with differing lockdown restrictions impacting sales and cross-border movements. The
magnitude of the COVID 19 impact on economic activity practically mitigated any post-Brexit trading impact
on the business.

As European countries began to ease restrictions and the UK government announced that car dealerships
could reopen from June 1, 2020, we saw demand increase across our online platforms and were able to
recommission our transport capabilities to support the vehicle logistics of vendors and buyers. Trading
rebounded in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2021 as restrictions were lifted and the workforce largely
returned from furlough. Strong stable pricing provided good operational efficiencies with predictable results
for buyers and sellers. Refreshed versions of BCA Live Online and the BCA Buyer mobile application provide
enhanced insight every time a buyer looks at, bids on or buys a vehicle. We were well placed to capitalize on
pent-up demand with all UK auctions fully digital, utilizing BCA Live Online and the BCA Buyer mobile
application.

At the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year 2021, we launched the “Retail Ready” digital sales channel
exclusively for trade customers to meet demand for high quality vehicles and to shorten inventory holding
times. The channel offers vehicles prepared cosmetically and mechanically to a new industry retail standard
allowing dealers to immediately place these vehicles onto their forecourt with little or no preparation and cost.


-----

The momentum continued into the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021 despite ongoing restrictions across
continental Europe and the introduction of tiered restrictions in the UK. Customers continued to develop
their online as well as click and collect capabilities in order to continue trading at scale in this environment.

It was not until the return of a stricter lockdown in the UK that spanned the whole of the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year 2021 that activity was again significantly suppressed. The impact on trading was far less than in
the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021, reflecting the adaptability and resilience of the used car sector and the
incremental developments to our digital capability. The end of the Brexit transition period on December 31,
2020 provided limited disruption in comparison to the impact of COVID 19 restrictions.

_Divisional Review_

UK Vehicle Remarketing

The division generated revenue of £1,308.9 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £90.5 million for the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £1,377.1 million and £116.3 million for the unaudited
aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. The division’s volumes, revenues and Reported Adjusted
EBITDA were adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic restrictions during the fiscal year 2021. Our
revenues are impacted by the mix of vehicles for which we take title, whereby the full auction price of vehicles
sold is recognized as revenue, and those where we serve as an agent between vendor and buyer, for which
revenues are recognized in relation to auction fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical
pre- and post- auction services.

To enable vendors and buyers to continue to trade with confidence, UK Vehicle Remarketing accelerated its
digital transformation, trading fully online during the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (2020: 37%).
After the temporary cessation of physical auctions at the end of the fiscal year 2020, the division commenced
first quarter trading using its existing online auction platforms, including BCA Buyer mobile application,
BCA Live Online and BCA Buy Now with vehicles that had been imaged and prepared prior to the
implementation of pandemic restrictions. Working practices were revised through April 2020 and May 2020,
so vendor vehicles could be received and processed in line with working regulations. When automotive
dealerships were allowed to reopen on June 1, 2020, the division saw strong demand and stable pricing which
continued into the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021, with record sales volumes in September 2020 of over
25,000 units per week for four consecutive weeks.

September 2020 saw the introduction of our “Retail Ready”sales channel. Utilizing our expertise in wholesale
vehicle storage and refurbishment has enabled the division to introduce and define “Retail Ready” as a new
vehicle condition standard. This digital channel hosts vehicles prepared cosmetically and mechanically,
covering the repair of bodywork dents, stone chips, paint repairs, wheels, glass and lights, interior upholstery,
and tire condition and compatibility checks. Once refurbished, the vehicles are fully retail valeted and come
with a valid service for at least three months or 2,000 miles, a valid Ministry of Transport (MOT) certificate
for at least 6 months and all auxiliary items such as Satellite Navigation SD cards and charging cables present.
This enables customers to immediately place these vehicles onto their forecourt with no preparation time and
cost required.

The business has undergone significant changes to sales day operations, and during the third quarter of the
fiscal year 2021, the UK Vehicle Remarketing division reorganized the workforce, resulting in redundancies of
certain branch based roles. The tiered restrictions in the UK during November 2020 and December 2020, and
the full lockdown across the UK in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021 did not impact the business as
severely as the initial lockdown as our customers had evolved their ability to operate with social distancing
and other restrictions in place.

Outsourced remarketing contract volumes have been impacted, reflecting reduced lease churn and de-fleet
activity throughout the fiscal year 2021.

BCA Partner Finance continues to support buyer demand in our marketplace with penetration at 10.6% of
UK Vehicle Remarketing sales funded by BCA Partner Finance (2020: 12.7%). The reduction in penetration
has been due to dealers taking a more conservative position on their volumes and also the level of government
support that has been available throughout the fiscal year 2021.

International Vehicle Remarketing

The division generated revenue of £190.1 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £29.2 million for the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £201.0 million and £34.2 million for the unaudited


-----

aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. Availability of volumes was suppressed across Europe as
leasing companies and OEMs experienced delays in the return of financed vehicles and there was reduced
availability of new vehicles following COVID 19 disruptions. This was partially offset by some additional
international cross border buying activity undertaken in response to the various levels of supply and demand
seen across different markets, supported by our transport network of accredited partners. Average profitability
per vehicle increased driven by changes in country mix, in part reflecting the differing impacts of COVID 19
restrictions and increased export fee penetration.

In June 2020, the International Vehicle Remarketing division commissioned its first automated
inspection units in continental Europe, and at the end of the fiscal year 2021 were operating a number of
automated units in Denmark, France and the Netherlands. These drive-through units assess vehicle condition,
reducing the need for manual inspection and ensuring a consistent and accurate assessment.

The division also established a new vehicle reconditioning center in France in partnership with Emil Frey,
which began operation in August 2020. This facility offers refurbishment and grade enhancement to our
vendors, maximizing sales performance at auction.

Towards the end of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021, the division experienced renewed restrictions in
some of the markets in which it operates across Europe as national governments address increased COVID19
infection levels.

Vehicle Buying

The division generated revenue of £1,665.3 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £44.0 million for the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £1,529.8 million and £27.7 million for the unaudited
aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. WeBuyAnyCar continues to maintain its place as a market
leading C2B business in the UK online direct car buying market. Revenue and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA
increased period-on-period driven by higher revenue per units sold partially offset by lower annual volume
sold. Despite the significant disruption to the division’s retail estate during the fiscal year 2021, with long
periods of enforced closure, the buying network continued to expand in order to provide convenience for
consumers ending the year with 357 sites (2020: 315). Vehicles are sold from sites across the UK Vehicle
Remarketing estate and now include three WeBuyAnyCar dedicated selling centers.

The division supplies a controlled and diverse range of vehicles across all makes and marques, to support the
UK Vehicle Remarketing division auction sales program. During the fiscal year 2021, WeBuyAnyCar delivered
a new record volume week and purchased its 2 millionth vehicle 15 years after commencing trading and only
four years after achieving the 1 millionth vehicle milestone. This accelerated volume is underpinned by the
continued growth in brand recognition and consumer trust from the public. Our Christmas Day TV
advertising campaign was met with strong consumer interest, with record festive period website visits. As the
brand builds the division is expanding the marketing and advertising channels across digital platforms
(Facebook, YouTube, etc.) to broaden engagement with a wider audience.

The move to 100% online auctions in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, and the development of three
dedicated selling hubs means we are better able to track and analyze customer demand and ensure we are
servicing it appropriately. Inventory at March 28, 2021 was £107.0 million (March 29, 2020: £44.2 million),
reflecting the continued growth in the business compared with a period of inventory reduction in the prior
year as COVID 19 restrictions came into place.

Within continental Europe, Vehicle Buying has increased 17.4% on prior year as we have improved our market
intelligence enabling us to better identify vehicle demand. We continue to focus on opportunities to raise
awareness of auction, purchasing batches of vehicles that enrich the remarketing programs for both vendors
and buyers.

Automotive Services

The division generated revenue of £288.5 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £12.5 million for the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £396.6 million and £22.6 million for the unaudited
aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. During the fiscal year 2021, the division was adversely
impacted by the COVID 19 restrictions in the UK, with the majority of vehicle movements restricted, most of
the fleet off the road and employees furloughed. The division did maintain some activity during COVID 19
restrictions, especially supporting key workers and the emergency services, including through the movement
of ambulances for the NHS.


-----

Government initiatives were used to support employment costs, and rent deferrals were negotiated with
landlords and finance companies. Activity began to recommence in June 2020, following the easing of
restrictions and reopening of car dealerships, with all business areas returning to profitability and delivering
higher margin work that could not be performed earlier in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021. The division
continued to increase the penetration of internal moves and refurbishments for UK Vehicle Remarketing,
utilizing an increased transporter fleet following the strategic acquisition of used transporters from some
smaller distressed operators, driving increased internal efficiency and reduced costs.

Logistics continued to see strong demand from leasing companies for inspections and collections following
easing of lockdown restrictions, and vehicle flow efficiency returned to our Fleet Solutions and Vehicle
Services sites as dispatches to customers returned to normal levels post-lockdown.

During the fiscal year 2021, Fleet Solutions utilized the capability and expertise developed in preparing and
refurbishing fleet vehicles to establish and support the newly developed “Retail Ready” industry vehicle
standard. In order to support “Retail Ready,”we announced the development of the new 65-acre mega-center
in Bristol. Leveraging our strong and well established integrated capability has enabled the division to
accelerate the delivery of “Retail Ready” vehicles to support the new sales channel.

**_Unaudited Aggregated 52-week Period ended March 29, 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019_**

Revenue increased by £476.6 million from £3,028.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to
£3,504.6 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. IAS 17 Adjusted
EBITDA increased by £15.7 million from £174.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to
£190.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted
EBITDA increased by £29.7 million from £174.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to
£204.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020.

The period-on-period growth in revenue, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA
has been driven by increased sales of vehicles by the Vehicle Buying division and strong performance in
outsourced remarketing contracts (where we typically account for the full vehicle value within revenue), which
continued to deliver growth in vehicle sold volumes. Increased sales, control over variable operating costs and
overhead efficiency from greater volume throughput contributed to IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA growth. This
strong trading performance has been delivered despite the disruption to trading during the latter half of
March 2020 and after taking into account additional provisions against vehicle values as a result of COVID
19.

During March 2020, national governments across Europe responded to the COVID 19 pandemic and
implemented restrictions including social distancing lockdown arrangements, resulting in a cessation of
physical auctions, the closure of the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate and a significant reduction in the movement
and inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. This had a significant impact on financial performance
during March 2020, as a large element of our operating costs relate to payroll, property and transporter
leases. Given the speed at which restrictions were imposed, it was not possible to reduce costs at the same rate
as the reduction in operating activity. We furloughed over 80% of employees, and utilized government
initiatives across Europe to support employment costs, retail premises rents and business rates. Management
negotiated with landlords to reduce or defer rental payments, to maximize liquidity throughout the
restrictions. At the end of the fiscal year 2020, management recognized an exceptional COVID 19 related
goodwill impairment. This reflected the impact of the time value of money on earnings and growth, following
the suppression of our operational activities as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic.

_Divisional Review_

UK Vehicle Remarketing

The division generated revenue of £1,377.1 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £116.3 million for the
unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £1,242.5 million and £109.4 million
for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The division traded strongly during the fiscal year
2020 despite the impact of the temporary cessation of physical auctions in March 2020 as a result of
government restrictions in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Revenue increased as a result of increased
volumes including an extended sales program during the Christmas period. Auction activity throughout the
fiscal year 2020 was driven by strong volumes from the Vehicle Buying division (WeBuyAnyCar) and
outsourced remarketing contracts. This was supported by BCA Partner Finance penetration, which continues
to increase. The BCA Partner Finance proposition, which includes branded auctions, part-exchange financing


-----

and funding 100% of the hammer price plus fees and transport of purchases, continues to support dealer
customers through the liquidity it provides.

International Vehicle Remarketing

The division generated revenue of £201.0 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £34.2 million for the
unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £184.3 million and £33.7 million
for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The division performed strongly in the period with
continued growth in remarketing volumes. Revenue for the fiscal year 2020 was driven by increased fees and
including a higher proportion of cross border sales. Strong performance in Denmark and the Netherlands
along with volume growth in Germany and France, contributed to an increase in revenue, IAS 17 Adjusted
EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA. Our Danish auction successfully transitioned to a fully
online auction program in fiscal year 2020. BCA Norway, which commenced trading in April 2019, generated
good volumes focusing on remarketing of electric vehicles, due to the high penetration of electric vehicles in
this region. Demand for cross-border sourcing of vehicles in Europe continued to rise period-on-period and is
supported by our transport network of accredited partners. From the second week of March 2020, national
restrictions for COVID 19 were implemented across Europe, starting with Italy and France, which were
amongst the first to implement full lockdown. While all European countries were impacted, those with lighter
social distancing measures, for example Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and Germany, allowed trading at
greater scale through March 2020.

Vehicle Buying

The division generated revenue of £1,529.8 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £27.7 million for the
unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £1,219.8 million and £24.1 million
for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. WeBuyAnyCar maintained double-digit volume
growth with an expanded network of 315 sites providing increased convenience for consumers. During the
fiscal year 2020, a record 10,200 vehicles were purchased in a single week by WeBuyAnyCar. The division
supplied a controlled and diverse range of vehicles across all makes and marques, to support the UK Vehicle
Remarketing division auction sales program. Inventory as of March 29, 2020 was £44.2 million (March 31,
2019: £29.3 million), reflecting the continued growth in the business, offset by the impact of COVID 19
restrictions. In line with government guidelines WeBuyAnyCar closed its retail estate from March 23, 2020,
preventing the purchase of vehicles from consumers. The online channels of the UK Vehicle Remarketing
division have continued to sell vehicles that were already held by WeBuyAnyCar. At the period end
management made additional provisions against inventory given the price uncertainty as a result of the
COVID 19 pandemic and associated restrictions. European car buying operations were paused as the impact
of COVID 19 became evident, resulting in an operating loss due to costs associated with holding vehicles, and
the impact of vehicles sold below purchase price due to temporarily reduced demand.

Automotive Services

The division generated revenue of £396.6 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £22.6 million for the
unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £381.4 million and £19.1 million
for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The division continued to increase the penetration
of internal moves and refurbishment completed for UK Vehicle Remarketing and WeBuyAnyCar, driving
increased internal efficiency and reducing costs. In the period since the CA Acquisition, the services business
performed well with increased demand for manufacturer accredited refurbishment capability.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Liquidity_**

Liquidity describes our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business
operations, including funding working capital and capital expenditure needs, servicing our indebtedness,
paying taxes and funding operating activities. Our primary sources of liquidity consist of (i) cash flows from
operating activities, (ii) borrowings under loan facilities and finance arrangements that we may incur from
time to time, (iii) issuances of debt securities and (iv) borrowings under bank overdrafts borrowings. A variety
of factors influence our financial condition and liquidity, including:

- a reduction in cash flows from operating activities due to, for instance, volume fluctuations in our business
and pricing pressures we face from our competitors;

- adverse working capital developments, including increases in non-collectible receivables (to the extent we
do not receive recourse through a vehicle held a security) and changes in supplier payment terms;


-----

- our inability to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and

- higher capital expenditures and funding requirements.

If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility) are insufficient to pay
our obligations as they mature or to fund liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay business activities, fixed costs and capital expenditure;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

As of March 28, 2021, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, our primary financing arrangements
will be the Notes, the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility,
and we would have had £113 million of Adjusted Cash. See “Capitalization.”

Although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs for the
foreseeable future, no assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operating
activities or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to
pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs.

No assurance can be given that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or
on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our current or future indebtedness, including the
Notes and the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility, may
limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile,
_Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our_
_ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.”_

**_Capital Resources_**

We have significant leverage and debt service obligations. As of March 28, 2021, after giving effect to the
Refinancing Transactions, we would have had £1,760 million of Adjusted Total Debt, comprising the Notes,
the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Facility, excluding finance leases and borrowings under
the Receivables Facility. As of March 28, 2021, we also had £40 million drawn under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility. We do not expect to borrow cash under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date but
expect to utilize ancillary facilities and letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility for ordinary course
operations. In addition, as of March 28, 2021, we had borrowings under the Receivables Facility of
£148.3 million.

The Indenture governing the Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement governing the Senior Term Loan Facility
and the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility Agreement governing the Second Lien Facility
and will contain, covenants significantly restricting our ability to, among others:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

- pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem our stock;

- make investments or other restricted payments;

- enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

- transfer or sell assets;

- engage in transactions with affiliates;

- create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

- impair security interests; and

- merge or consolidate with or into another company.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. These covenants
could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs. The Senior Facilities Agreement
also contains a financial covenant requiring us to comply with a senior secured leverage ratio on the last day


-----

of each period ending on a quarter. See “Description of the Notes,” “Description of Other Financial
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement”and “Description of Other Financial Arrangements—Second Lien_
_Facility Agreement.”_

We anticipate that our significant leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may
have important negative consequences for you. For further information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—Our substantial leverage and debt service_
_obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the_
_Notes and the Guarantees.”_

_Cash Inflow from Operating Activities_

Cash inflow from operating activities for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 increased by £3.4 million,
or 29.3%, from £11.6 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £15.0 million for the 52-week
period ended March 28, 2021, primarily as a result of the longer trading period captured in the results for the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (i.e., 52 weeks) compared to the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020
(i.e., 145 days) as a result of the CA Acquisition. This increase was also due to improved profitability, which
was partially offset by the deliberate increase of inventory (representing a cash outflow of £176.1 million) in
the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 in anticipation of greater vehicle demand following the planned
easing of lockdown measures.

Cash inflow from operating activities for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 decreased by £75.0 million,
or 86.6%, from £86.6 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £11.6 million for the 42-week
period ended March 29, 2020, primarily as a result of the longer trading period captured in the results for the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (i.e., 52 weeks) compared to the 42-week period ended March 31, 2019
(i.e., 145 days) as a result of the CA Acquisition.

_Cash Outflow from Investing Activities_

Cash outflow from investing activities of £52.1 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 reflect
net investments in long term assets (including property).

Cash outflow from investing activities of £1,784.3 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020
primarily reflect cash paid in connection with the CA Acquisition (£1,762.4 million) and the net purchase of
other long term assets (£21.9 million).

Cash outflows from investing activities of £46.6 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 reflect
the net outflows from the purchase of long term assets.

_Cash Flow from Financing Activities_

Cash outflow from financing activities for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 were £63.9 million,
primarily driven by the principal element of lease payments (£42.6 million), a net cash outflow on borrowings
(£16.8 million) and outflow on BCA Partner Finance borrowings (£11.1 million).


-----

Cash inflow from financing activities for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 were £1,984.7 million,
primarily as a result of refinancing related to the CA Acquisition. Financing cash inflows included equity
finance (£1,015.3 million) and borrowings (£1,363.4 million), which were partially offset by borrowings repaid
(£357.7 million), and on financing fees, lease payments and other items (representing a net total of
£36.3 million).

Cash flow from financing activities for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 was negative £60.4 million,
primarily as a result of a dividends paid (£71.4 million), acquisition of treasury shares (£25.2 million) and the
payment of a finance lease liability (£8.6 million). This negative cash flow was partially offset by net proceeds
from borrowings and sale and leaseback of finance leases.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures consists of the costs of development of sites and the purchases of vehicles, fixtures
and fittings and computer systems, as well as the internal development of software and web sites. The table
below presents our capital expenditures for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the 42-week period

2020, this comprises additions to intangible assets (£4.2 million), additions to property, plant and equipment (£21.9 million) and
cash right of use asset additions (£1.4 million). For the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, this comprises additions to intangible
assets (£10.3 million), additions to property, plant and equipment (£34.3 million).

(b) Represents proceeds from the disposal of certain plant, machinery and motor vehicles.

(c) Represents adjustments in connection with ordinary course sale and lease back transactions with respect to trucks and trailers as
well as timing adjustments in respect thereof.

(d) For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, this includes £19.7 million relating to a tactical acquisition of a third-party site that
was then sold in May 2021 for £23.4 million. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Recent Acquisitions.”

Underlying Cash CAPEX amounted to £30.1 million, £15.2 million and £28.5 million for the 52-week period
ended March 28, 2021, the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31,
2019, respectively. Internally generated and other intangibles primarily comprised software developed
internally and licenses acquired. The expenditure on land and buildings was primarily the result of the
investment in a third-party site that was then sold in May 2021 for £23.4 million. See “Summary—Recent
_Developments—Recent Acquisitions.” Capital expenditure also includes property, plant and machinery,_
fixtures and fittings and other equipment used in our operations.

Our business is characterized by low expenditures, which represented less than 1% of revenue for each of the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period
ended March 31, 2019. We expect to make capital expenditures of approximately £35 million during the fiscal
year ending 2022, excluding one-off acquisitions in respect of sites in Corby (see “Summary—Recent
_Developments—Recent Acquisitions”)._

**Working Capital**

We experience some seasonality with respect to our working capital. In particular, used vehicle sales in the UK
tend to increase during vehicle registration plate change periods in March and September of each year. In


-----

March, in particular, new vehicle sales traditionally peak in the UK, and as a result, dealer vendors of the
Vehicle Remarketing division typically experience an increase in part-exchange volumes, which has a
subsequent effect of increasing sales through the Marketplace. Conversely, our revenue typically decreases
during the summer and in December, a seasonality pattern that is followed by sales in both the Vehicle Buying
division and the Automotive Services division. As a result of these fluctuations, we experience seasonal swings
in our negative working capital and our negative working capital tends to decline in the quarter ending in
December and to increase in the quarter ending March. See “— Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—
_Seasonality.”_

Finance lease repayments reflects the cash costs of servicing finance leases related to refinanced trucks and
trailers (net of interest), which are refinanced through sale and leaseback transactions.

Change in net working capital reflects the movements in our inventory, and volume based building and
unwinding of our negative working capital auction cash cycle. At the end of fiscal year 2021, we increased our
vehicle buying activities in anticipation of increased demand from our customers corresponding with the
lifting of COVID 19 restrictions. In addition, we experienced positive working capital as a result of holding
and preparing inventory for our “Retail Ready” sales channel, which involves cosmetically and mechanically
repairing vehicles ahead of sale. At the end of fiscal year 2020, we reduced our vehicle buying activities as a
result of COVID 19 and the related initial lockdown that followed the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic
and at the same time, we sought to liquidate our existing vehicles. At the end of fiscal year 2019, we experienced
a decrease in volume and in negative working capital as a result of physical auction closures over the Easter
holiday period.

Change in net working capital (BCA Partner Finance) represents movements in the amounts we self-fund
under our buyer finance services, BCA Partner Finance.

Rent cash adjustment represents the difference between contractual rent payment obligations and the
accounting treatment with respect to such rent payments.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of March 28, 2021, we had not entered into any off-balance sheet transactions.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange and interest
rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of risk management
is carried out by the board of the Parent.

**_Market Risk_**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices (principally exchange rates and interest rates) will affect
our income or the value of our holdings of financial instruments.

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We operate in the UK and continental Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland) and are therefore exposed to foreign exchange
risk. Foreign exchange risk arises primarily on recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign
operations. These overseas operations’ revenues and costs are mainly denominated in the currencies of the
countries in which our operations are located. The most significant of these is the euro.

We do not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures. We monitor our exposure to
currency fluctuations on an ongoing basis. We maintain part of our debt in euro to reflect the currency in
which our revenue is generated.

We have not hedged profit translation exposures. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, we did not
have any hedges in place.

In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, if pound sterling had strengthened by 10% on average against
the euro with all other variables held constant, Reported Adjusted EBITDA for the year would have been
£3.8 million lower (2020: £1.3 million lower) as a result of a reduction of the equivalent value in pound
sterling of profits denominated in euro.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our interest rate risk arises from our borrowings. Interest rates have been historically low and stable in terms
of both LIBOR and EURIBOR rates and consequently no structured hedging has been implemented in the
current period. We will continue to monitor interest rates and assess the requirement for hedging in the future.
All of our finance leases are at fixed rates of interest.

In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, if the average rate on floating rate borrowings had been 50 basis
points higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the period would have been £5.7 million
lower (2020: £6.6 million lower).

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
contractual obligations and arises principally through trade receivables from customers and cash balances.


-----

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they fall due. We monitor
forecasts of our liquidity requirements to ensure we have sufficient cash to meet operational needs while
maintaining sufficient headroom on our undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that we
minimize the risk of breaching borrowing limits or covenants on any of our borrowing facilities. Such
forecasting takes into consideration our debt financing plan and covenant compliance requirements on our
borrowings. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we meet all liabilities from intercompany loans.
Our liability for operating expenses is monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure cash resources are adequate to
meet liabilities as they fall due.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires us to make estimates,
judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, with any changes arising
being recognized in the period in which the change in estimate is made or the final result determined.

**_Income Tax_**

_Taxation_

Accruals for current tax and amounts payable under local indirect taxes such as sales taxes and VAT are based
on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood that
tax positions taken will be sustained. Management estimates the amount of taxes payable based upon their
analysis and determines whether provision should be made for potential settlement of disputed positions
which are under negotiation. Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the related
tax amount.

_Deferred Tax_

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent management’s best estimate in determining the amounts to be
recognized. When assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognized, consideration is
given to the timing and level of future taxable income.

**_Trade and Other Receivables_**

Loss allowances for trade receivables due from customers under BCA Partner Finance arrangements are
recognized under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the receivable. Management are
required to develop estimates of credit risk using the best available information about past events, current
conditions and forecasts of economic conditions. BCA Partner Finance receivables are asset backed, providing
a level of protection based on the value and recovery of the asset. Management apply judgement in assessing
whether there is a significant change in credit risk which would impact the expected credit loss allowance
recognized.

**_Lease Liabilities_**

Management use a lease specific incremental borrowing rate to discount the future lease liabilities, where the
interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available. Using an incremental borrowing rate requires
management to estimate the rate of interest that would be paid to borrow over a similar term, and with similar
security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic
environment.

**_Acquisitions_**

For all acquisitions in the period, management are required to apply judgement to determine the business
combination accounting, and in relation to the identification of separable assets and liabilities arising on
acquisition.

Management make estimates of future cash flows to value the assets and make estimates in determining the
useful economic life of intangible assets.


-----

**_Intangible Assets_**

An impairment review has been conducted on all goodwill and intangible assets held by the CA Group. The
impairment review is performed on a value in use basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash
flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth
rate. Specifically, the future cash flows are sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth,
profitability margin(s) and the long-term growth rate of the relevant market. Given the degree of subjectivity
involved, actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.

**_Pension Obligations_**

The CA Group’s net retirement benefit obligation, which is reviewed by management using assessments from
independent actuaries each period, is based on key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation, future
salary increases and pension costs. These assumptions may be different to the actual outcome.

**Overview**

**_UK and Continental European Vehicle Parc_**

We operate in the UK and continental Europe used vehicle market. The number of vehicles in operation (the
“vehicle parc”) across the UK and continental Europe has grown consistently since 2012, driven by a relatively
stable vehicle parc churn and growing vehicle penetration rates. Vehicle penetration rates, defined as number
of vehicles in circulation per capita in a country, are expected to continue to grow for most markets.

The European light vehicle parc grew at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2012 and 2019, and currently
stands at approximately 320 million units (for the year 2020). According to IHS, the European light vehicle
parc is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 0.8% between 2021 and 2026, driven by growth in the
penetration of vehicles per population, with new additions to the vehicle parc in particular of battery electric
vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

Since the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, the importance of vehicle ownership for consumers has been
strengthened (see “—Key Trends”.) The below chart shows the evolution of the European light vehicle parc
between 2012 and 2020, and projections between 2021 and 2026:

_Source: IHS database[(1)]._

(1) “Other Europe” represents Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Romania, Ireland, Bulgaria, Finland,
Hungary, Czech Republic, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia and Estonia.

Sales of new cars eventually translate into used car transactions through used car churn. Used car churn,
which is used as a measure of annual turnover in the ownership of cars in operation, varies by geography. In
the UK market, for the fiscal year 2019, used car churn stood at approximately 23%, compared to
approximately 13% in the continental European market, in line with customary trends. As a result, used car
transaction volumes as a proportion of the total vehicle parc are higher in the UK than in continental Europe.

We believe that the growing popularity of PCP (Personal Contract Purchase) plans among new car sales has
contributed to an increased visibility and rates of churn in the UK. An increasing amount of cars coming off
PCP plans offers a stream of supply for the used car market, many of which are transacted via exchanges such
as Constellation’s B2B Marketplace.

In addition, used car churn across the UK and continental Europe is impacted by a number of key factors.
These include:

- Maturing leases and other finance agreements;

- Changing consumer preferences;


-----

- Necessary cost of repairs as vehicles age, as well as warranty expirations;

- Tax and regulatory changes such as low emission restrictions and fees related thereto;

- Dealer and OEM finance offers and promotions;

- Rental and car sharing fleets, which typically churn vehicles at a faster rate than vehicles in private
ownership, according to IHS;

- Insurance cost, safety, recalls, reliability and technological improvements

Used vehicle churn is a key factor of our business model. Given the graduated auction fee structure is relatively
insensitive to vehicle price, the business model is more dependent on the volume of vehicles going through the
marketplace than the overall value of the vehicles.

**_UK and Continental European Used Car Market_**

The continental European used car market was estimated by Roland Berger to be valued at €410 billion for the
year 2020. The total volume of used car sales in Europe amounted to approximately 45 million cars during the
same period, of which approximately 84% were derived from continental Europe and the remainder from the
UK, according to IHS.

Moreover, annual sale volume movements in the used car market have been proportionally lower than in the
new car market, as the used car market is far less sensitive to economic downturns than the new car market,
due in part to the greater size of the used car market and the fact that certain periods of economic stress can
be a driver of used car transactions, such as de-fleeting of underutilized car rental fleets or consumers trading
down cars. For example, new car sales in the UK were more volatile between 2008 and 2020 than used car
sales, with a peak-to-trough maximum variance of approximately 39% compared to approximately 13% for
used car sales during the same period.

**_Impact of the COVID 19 Pandemic on the Used Car Market_**

From the end of the first quarter of 2020, the UK and continental European used car markets were impacted
by the temporary closure of bricks and mortar dealerships as a result of lockdown measures and forced
temporary business closures resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic. Following the introduction of these
lockdown measures, the used car markets in the UK, France, Germany and Italy recorded a significant decline
through March and April 2020. However, volumes began to recover strongly from early June 2020, as
lockdown restrictions gradually started to ease in these regions. The German market suffered from another
sharp downturn as a result of the renewed lockdown imposed in December 2020, but the latest data from
Indicata indicates that volumes have recovered close to pre-COVID levels. In France, despite a recovery from
a trough in April 2020, French used car sale volumes have remained below pre-COVID 19 levels. The latest
trading data from Indicata indicates that used car volumes in Italy and the Netherlands have recovered to
pre-COVID levels.

In our largest market, the UK, used car sales suffered a year-on-year decline of approximately 11% in the
fiscal year 2020, to approximately 7.4 million in 2020 from approximately 8.3 million in 2019, according to
IHS, driven by mandatory retail closures during periods of lockdown. Despite the ongoing global pandemic,
the UK recorded periods of strong recovery when such restrictions were subsequently lifted and retailers


-----

reopened, driving monthly used car transaction volumes from July to October 2020 above those for the same
period in 2019 and demonstrating the continued strong demand for used cars by end consumers. The
continued strength of demand for used cars throughout this period is also evidenced by the fact that average
transaction prices remained above pre-pandemic levels from July to October 2020, during which retailers were
open. The impact on the used car market of the varying forms of lockdown from November 2020 to
April 2021 was less severe than the initial lockdown from March 2020 to June 2020, primarily due to the
increased use by dealers of click-and-collect channels, which they were able to develop and improve during the
periods of mandatory closures from March 2020. Following the easing of COVID 19-related restrictions and
the reopening of retailers on April 12, 2021 in the UK, used car transactions have bounced back strongly, as
evidenced by the chart below:

_Source: Indicata Market Watch (Edition 16, May 2021), SMMT._

The used car market, especially in the UK, is expected to remain strong in the near-term, supported by renewed
appetite for individual vehicle ownership (Source: Roland Berger). Moreover, an increased amount of
household savings accumulated through the COVID 19 pandemic bolsters the consumption outlook (Source:
_HSBC)._

Vehicle parc growth rates in key markets across Europe are expected to grow at CAGR ranging from 0.5% to
1.8% between 2021 and 2026 (Source: IHS).

**Used Vehicle Market Ecosystem**

Our UK Vehicle Remarketing and International Vehicle Remarketing divisions, which trade under the BCA
brand name, as well as WeBuyAnyCar, our C2B Marketplace business line which represents our Vehicle
Buying division’s operations in the UK, constitute significant parts of the value chain within which we are
active, as illustrated by the below chart:

_Source: Management Information._

Market participants include:

   - Vendors, who are looking to dispose of vehicles, and are divided into the below groups:

     - Corporate fleet, including finance and leasing companies (looking to dispose over-age or overmileage vehicles, repossessed vehicles, off-lease vehicles, including vehicles after PCP plans);


-----

     - Dealers and car supermarkets (looking to move unwanted part-exchange stock or liquidate aged
inventory);

     - OEMs (looking to dispose vehicles after corporate fleet or other ownership); and

     - C2B marketplaces or vehicle buying platforms (consumer-facing companies that seek to liquidate
stock purchased directly from consumers).

   - Marketplaces and exchanges, which comprise of firms looking to enable vendors to sell used vehicles to
a variety of buyers, as well as to provide a logistics solution from sellers to buyers;

   - Classifieds, which comprise of online automotive classified websites that generate leads for traditional
dealers, car supermarkets and consumers looking to dispose of used vehicles, and provide purely
advertising and lead-generation services without end-to-end transaction capabilities;

  - Trade Buyers, who comprise of mainly professional players, including traditional dealers, car
supermarkets and online B2C players; and

   - Consumers, who comprise of private individuals looking to buy or dispose of vehicles, and who may
also trade vehicles amongst themselves (C2C transactions), in addition to the other channels described
above.

Marketplaces and exchanges are at the center of the used car value chain, offering transparency, speed,
certainty and liquidity for both vendors and buyers. They form a key part of the fleet management
infrastructure for vendors by outsourcing non-core competencies and helping to extract maximum value
quickly, as well as representing a significant channel for buyers, driven by their ability to offer on-market
pricing and maximum choice of vehicles on used vehicle marketplaces. A significant fragmentation of buyers
and vendors across the UK and continental European markets enhances the prominence of used car
marketplaces as a critical channel for transactions. By way of illustration, the largest used car dealership in the
UK has a market share of approximately 3%, while the largest European used car dealership has a market
share inferior to 1%.

Leading marketplaces could be seen to benefit from self-reinforcing dynamics whereby as they grow in both
scale and geographic breadth, their attractiveness to both buyers and vendors increases, which in turn
reinforces their leadership position. By adding ancillary services such as logistics, vehicle refurbishment and
buyer financing, among others, an automotive marketplace can also strengthen the attractiveness of its
services to its customers and thereby increase customer stickiness, while also growing the level of profit
achieved per vehicle transacted through its platform. A key success factor for a leading automotive
marketplace is also having a reliable and diverse source of vehicles flowing through its platform.

Our Marketplace is a key participant in the used car market value chain throughout both the UK and
continental Europe. Notably, in the UK, we came into contact with approximately 13 million unique vehicles
in the fiscal year 2020, representing approximately one in three of all registered cars in the UK.

WeBuyAnyCar, our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, is a leading online C2B used vehicle
buying company, with more than 2.2 million cars bought since its inception and 461,000 vehicles purchased
and sold annually, on an annualized run-rated basis based on March, April and May 2021. WeBuyAnyCar
provides UK Vehicle Remarketing with used vehicles that would otherwise go to C2C markets or partexchanges. Once acquired on the WeBuyAnyCar platform, the purchased vehicles are sold through the
auctions conducted by UK Vehicle Remarketing, with an acquisition to sale cycle of approximately 10 days,
on average (fiscal year 2020, which is representative of our ordinary course business operations in a steady
state). WeBuyAnyCar provided approximately 35% of the UK Vehicle Remarketing sale volumes in the fiscal
year 2021.

Our integrated suite of services, both transactional (such as auctioning and vehicle buying) and transactionenabling (such as refurbishment, transport, valuation and other services) places us at the center of the
automotive value chain.

**Key Trends**

**_Increased consumer perception of the importance of car ownership_**

Partly as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, consumers now place an increased emphasis on the importance
of car ownership. This has been driven by a variety of different reasons, including a demographic move away
from urban areas due to the ability to work from home and a decline in the use of public transport and shared


-----

mobility (Source: BCG report). According to the OC&C survey (2021), the number of non-drivers who
definitely expect to own a car in the future has risen by 21% in the UK since 2019, and 40% of drivers in the
UK and Italy also stated that the COVID 19 pandemic has increased the importance they place on car
ownership. This is also true of younger drivers, with the proportion of drivers aged 18 to 29 against car
ownership falling from 11% to 5% during the same period.

**_Digitalization of the used car value chain_**

The used car value chain has long been reliant on physical transactions via bricks and mortar institutions, and
has also had a very low digital penetration relative to other industries. However, the change towards an online
business model has been accelerated, in particular as a result of and in response to the COVID 19 pandemic,
which forced businesses and consumers to resort to online channels while traditional retailers were closed.
This trend towards an increased digitalization has impacted both the B2B and B2C channels:

_B2B Channels_

The changes in operating environment spurred by the COVID 19 pandemic have led us to accelerate our shift
towards a fully digital online business model with increased focus on the functionality and usability of our
digital platforms, with a 100% online penetration in UK Vehicle Remarketing and an online penetration in
excess of 90% in International Vehicle Remarketing, in each case in the fiscal year 2021. Increasing online
penetration of auctions presents a unique opportunity to increase the cost efficiency of used car marketplaces
and facilitates a more flexible utilization of real estate. In addition, digitalization also increases businesses’
resilience in the event of further lockdowns as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic or other adverse economic
conditions by continuing to trade largely online. Lastly, the digitalization of the used car value chain also
bolsters operators’ data collection and analytics capabilities thanks to the higher number of transactions
concluded online. This trend is likely to disproportionately benefit large players, such as ourselves, for two
reasons. Firstly, because of their broader geographical presence, as digital auctions increase the scope to pair
buyers and sellers that are located far away from one another, and such pairing requires significant logistical
capabilities. Secondly, because of their overall scale and data infrastructure, since small players are less likely
to have the digital expertise and scale to support the costs of digital investments.

_B2C Channels_

Trends resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic have also accelerated consumers’ willingness to accept digital
purchasing as a means to buy a car, which has historically been at very low levels according to Roland Berger.
This trend has facilitated the growth of online B2C retailers, such as cinch, with an increase in transparency
and convenience for consumers buying used cars, thereby potentially helping increase used car churn over
time, as well as an increase in the demand for the sourcing of high quality used cars from vehicle exchanges
such as ours, and in turn the demand for high quality used cars from vehicle buying platforms.

**_Continued structural growth opportunity for digital vehicle purchasing platforms_**

There is significant potential for vehicle buying platforms to continue to increase their penetration of the
large, fragmented and sometimes inefficient C2C and part-exchange segments of the used car market. As the
growth of platforms such as WeBuyAnyCar in the UK and other C2B sourcing businesses in parts of
continental Europe have shown, such vehicle buying platforms offer a convenient, transparent and efficient
way for consumers to sell their cars. With consumers becoming increasingly comfortable using online channels
for car transactions (Source: Roland Berger) and with such vehicle buying services still typically operating at
low levels of overall market penetration, we believe that leading vehicle buying platforms can continue to
exhibit structural growth.

**_Technological and regulatory changes driving faster vehicle churn_**

The pace of both technological and regulatory changes in the European automotive market has substantially
increased in recent years. A confluence of technological changes, such as more cost efficient batteries and
advancement of automotive sensors, and regulatory measures, such as EU-wide fleet emission legislation to
reduce light vehicle CO2 emissions has resulted in the rapid advancement of light vehicle technology on offer
to consumers. In addition, other car technologies, such as autonomous driving features and advanced car
connectivity, are rapidly evolving. To seek up-to-date technology and adapt to changing regulation, consumers
therefore have an increasing number of reasons to change their choice of vehicle on a more regular basis.


-----

**Competition**

Our key competitors vary between our business lines:

- B2B Marketplace: key competitors include other exchanges, such as Manheim and Aston Barclay in the
UK and Auto1 in continental Europe, as well as numerous smaller players.

- C2B Marketplace: key competitors include other car buying platforms competing with WeBuyAnyCar
such as WeWantAnyCar.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We operate leading digital used vehicle marketplaces (both business to business (“B2B”) and consumer to
business (“C2B”)) in the UK and B2B marketplaces in continental Europe and are a leading provider of
associated automotive services, including vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet
management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. We have physical presence in 10 countries
across the UK and continental Europe as well as unmatched sourcing, data, technology and logistics
capabilities. As of March 28, 2021, our business comprises:

- a leading B2B digital used vehicle marketplace across the UK and continental Europe, which facilitated the
sale of approximately 1.5 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 1.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year
2021;

- a leading C2B digital used vehicle marketplace in the UK, WeBuyAnyCar, with sold volumes of 321,000
vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, reflecting the COVID 19
restrictions on the business that now has an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in
March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period); and

- a leading automotive logistics service business in the UK, which moved more than 2.8 million vehicles in
the UK in the fiscal year 2020 and 2.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021, and stored, refurbished and
processed more than 950,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 675,000 in the fiscal year 2021.

We estimate that for the fiscal year 2020 we came in contact with approximately one in every three vehicles in
the UK (approximately 29 million touch points, of which approximately 13 million were unique vehicles out
of a vehicle parc of approximately 41 million, and including approximately 24 million digital touch points).
Through our digital used vehicle marketplaces (the “Marketplace”), we are a critical liquidity provider to the
used vehicles market across the UK and continental Europe, matching the complex requirements of both
vendors and buyers and also facilitating the purchase of individual vehicles from consumers. The Marketplace
facilitates speedy disposal of high volumes of vehicles and offers a broad range of consistently graded vehicle
stock, thereby providing efficiency, liquidity (i.e., fast disposal of vehicle stock) and choice. Moreover, we are
the UK’s leading provider of automotive services solutions.

By providing a full suite of auction and automotive services, we offer our customers solutions for almost all
stages of the vehicle life-cycle, beginning as soon as the new car arrives at the port. Our scope of services
provides synergistic benefits across our divisions, as our vehicle sales platforms, together with our automotive
services solutions, generate vehicle and pricing data used in both our vehicle remarketing and vehicle buying
operations.

Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, we have accelerated our digital transition and now transact digitally
almost 100% of our volumes through online channels. We integrate our digital and physical assets to provide
innovative multi-service solutions, maximizing speed, intelligence and performance across our comprehensive
offerings. In the fiscal year 2021, 100% (2020: 37%) of our auction volumes in the UK Vehicle Remarketing
division and 96% (2020: 84%) of our auction volumes in the International Vehicle Remarketing division were
transacted online, which is a testament to our successful shift towards a predominantly digital online business
model moving forward.

In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, we generated £253.1 million of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA,
as compared to £232.8 million, £204.1 million and £174.4 million in the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019,
respectively.

We operate through three main business lines: (i) the B2B Marketplace business line, which is comprised of
our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying
division’s operations in continental Europe, (ii) the C2B Marketplace business line, which is WeBuyAnyCar,
our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, and (iii) the Automotive Services business line, which is
accounted for in our Automotive Services division.

- B2B Marketplace: B2B Marketplace is our core business that facilitates the exchange of used vehicles
between vendors and buyers through primarily digital auctions. As of March 28, 2021, our digital auctions
are supported by 21 physical sites in the UK (23 as of June 1, 2021) and 30 physical sites in continental
Europe at which vehicles are stored, inspected, repaired and refurbished.


-----

B2B Marketplace (which excludes WeBuyAnyCar) does not take title to the majority of vehicles that it sells,
but instead serves as an agent between vendor and buyer and recognizes revenues through auction transaction
fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical pre- and post- auction services such as
inspections, appraisals, repairs, refurbishment, imaging, storage and handling. We also purchase vehicles
directly from certain corporate vendors under outsourced remarketing contracts, whereby we directly buy our
vendors’ inventory and have discretion over the remarketing channel through which we sell the vehicle. B2B
Marketplace takes title to such vehicles until the time of resale and recognizes revenues for the full sale value
of the vehicle less the cost of acquisition. Vehicles acquired pursuant to outsourced remarketing contracts are
typically resold within 15 to 30 days of acquisition and in turn generate additional revenue above the auction
fees.

B2B Marketplace also includes our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, which is
focused on purchasing batches of vehicles primarily from corporates in continental Europe.

In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division generated £90.5 million
of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £116.3 million; 52-week
period ended March 31, 2019: £109.4 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division
sold approximately 867,000 vehicles (2020: 1,063,000 vehicles; 2019: 1,030,0000 vehicles). In the 52-week
period ended March 28, 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division generated £29.2 million of IAS
17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £34.2 million; 52-week period ended
March 31, 2019: £33.7 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division sold
approximately 334,000 vehicles (2020: 401,000 vehicles; 2019: 388,000 vehicles).

- C2B Marketplace: C2B Marketplace is our C2B vehicle buying business which operates in the UK through
WeBuyAnyCar. WeBuyAnyCar purchases used vehicles directly from consumers, leveraging its proprietary
online pricing quotation systems and efficient physical inspection processes to facilitate purchases from
such consumers. WeBuyAnyCar has carried out a total of 2.2 million vehicle purchases since its inception
in 2006, and in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar recorded more than 22 million unique
visitors to its website and performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online. As of March 28, 2021,
WeBuyAnyCar operates in 357 locations across the UK, which are located within an average drive time of
under 14 minutes to customers. In addition, WeBuyAnyCar offers swift services to its consumers, allowing
them to obtain a quote in under 60 seconds and to then subsequently receive monies for the purchase of
their vehicle within 30 minutes of the sale being concluded.

C2B Marketplace remarkets the vehicles it purchases exclusively through B2B Marketplace within
approximately 10 days and accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division in
the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This allows us to actively manage the volumes and mix on the
Marketplace, while helping to de-risk the supply of vehicles to the auction.

C2B Marketplace’s consistent and growing profitability over the past years demonstrates our ability to
generate “metal margin” (accounted for in our Vehicle Buying division) on C2B vehicles in addition to core
auction buyer fees (accounted for in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division). Vehicles sourced via our C2B
Marketplace therefore result in higher profitability per vehicle for the CA Group. Our sophisticated and
proprietary pricing mechanism and real-time market data enable us to more accurately price the purchase of
vehicles to generate a profitable onward sale. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Vehicle Buying
division generated £44.0 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29,
2020: £27.7 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £24.1 million), which was predominantly generated
through C2B Marketplace (i.e., WeBuyAnyCar).

- Automotive Services: Automotive Services provides vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery
inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. With our refurbishment
offering (which has a 250,000 yearly vehicle refurbishment capacity), we are able to bring vehicles to either
wholesale standard or a “Retail Ready” standard (which refers to vehicles that are cosmetically and
mechanically prepared to be immediately placed for sale to end consumers and are therefore particularly
attractive to online car dealers). These standards increase prices achieved at auction and render it simpler
for dealers to on-sell the vehicle to consumers. We seek to develop a relationship with vendors and endeavor
to act as a one-stop shop for vehicles throughout the majority of their lifecycle, expanding our revenue
streams along the value chain and also positioning ourselves to be the preferred provider of remarketing
services when the vehicles come off lease or roll out of the fleet. Our overall infrastructure and logistics
network allow us to efficiently cover all key locations and major transport hubs in the UK. Automotive
Services helps maximize the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies derived from the
wide-ranging scope of services offered, benefitting both our customers as well as our own operations.


-----

Automotive Services generates revenue in the form of service fees. In the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, Automotive Services generated £12.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period
ended March 29, 2020: £22.6 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £19.1 million).

**History**

We have a history dating back to our first auction in 1946. Since then, we have undergone a number of
changes in ownership and also shifted our strategic focus in an effort to adapt to changes in the post-factory
automotive market. We have gradually expanded our operations through a mix of organic developments and
selective, value-enhancing strategic acquisitions, including WeBuyAnyCar (2013), Ambrosetti (2016) and
Supreme Wheels (2017). In 2019, we were acquired by TDR Capital, who believed in our potential to become
a truly pan-European leader in the used vehicle auction market and saw an opportunity to drive efficiencies
by digitalization of the used vehicle market, thereby strengthening the cash generative nature of our business
and building a platform for growth across our marketplaces. Under TDR Capital’s ownership, we continue to
focus on growing the breadth and scale of our services offering to build a more complete and integrated
automotive services solution across the life-cycle of the vehicle.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that, by virtue of the key strengths described below, we are well-positioned to benefit from
structurally favorable trends in the used vehicle market.

**_Leadership across Markets_**

We are a leading operator of digital used vehicle auctions in the UK and continental Europe and associated
automotive services across the UK. From continental Europe, we serve over 40 countries, leveraging our
ability to engage in cross-border activity across continental Europe. We believe our leading market positioning
and scale enable us to better serve used car buyers and sellers compared to many of our competitors as we are
able to price, source, inspect, refurbish, transport, service, market, arrange auctions and provide digital and
physical services and solutions in an efficient, comprehensive and effective way.

We believe our B2B Marketplace is the largest used vehicle auction operator across the UK and continental
Europe combined, with approximately £10 billion in gross merchandise value in connection with sales for the
fiscal year 2020. We believe that B2B Marketplace is the clear leader in the UK, having sold approximately
1.1 million vehicles in the UK in the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, as well as
approximately 400,000 vehicles sold in continental Europe in the same period. These attributes mean that we
can continuously meet the requirements of both professional vendors and buyers, including improved value,
liquidity, efficiency and choice, and are a key part of the reason that more than 25,000 active buyers used the
exchange in the fiscal year 2021. Through our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our Automotive Services
offering in the UK and our brand WeBuyAnyCar, we come into contact with approximately one third of all
vehicles exchanged in the UK each year.

We believe that C2B Marketplace, through our brand WeBuyAnyCar, is the leading vehicle buying service in
the UK, purchasing and selling over 321,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020. On an annualized basis based on
trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period, we purchased and
sold approximately 461,000 vehicles through WeBuyAnyCar. With greater than 22 million unique visitors to
its website in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021 and having performed approximately 15.6 million valuations
online and purchasing vehicles at 357 physical sites, each as of and for the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021, we believe that C2B Marketplace is significantly larger and has a significantly greater presence than any
other vehicle buying service in the UK. C2B Marketplace’s leadership position is continuing to strengthen
with an increase in the number of repeat customers in recent years, demonstrating consumers’ trust in the
brand and satisfaction around the value attached to the vehicle disposal process. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, WeBuyAnyCar has over 100,000 Trust Pilot reviews with an average 4.6 rating.

In Automotive Services, we operate one of the largest automotive vehicle movement, logistics, storage, predelivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment capability in the UK. As of
March 28, 2021, we own the largest transporter fleet in the UK, comprising 901 trucks capable of providing
bulk vehicle movements, thereby connecting the physical marketplace and increasing the integration between
our divisions. We also offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through
the process of vehicle delivery, handover and collection. In the fiscal year 2021, we moved 2.4 million vehicles
(2020: 2.8 million), including 563,000 single vehicle movements, and our in-house and sub-contracted
transporter fleet completed 94% of transport arranged for customers by the UK Vehicle Remarketing division.


-----

We offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through the process of
vehicle delivery, handover and collection.

We also operate one of the UK’s largest inspect and collect businesses with over 400,000 vehicle inspections
made in the fiscal year 2021, are one of the UK’s leading new vehicle storage handling and preparation
businesses and are among the UK’s leading de-fleet, refurbishment and alloy wheel businesses with more than
675,000 vehicles stored, refurbished and processed in the fiscal year 2021.

**_Superior Business Model Addressing the Full Value Chain and Difficult to Replicate_**

We operate under a marketplace model and benefit from self-reinforcing dynamics where each of our business
lines feeds into and reinforces the others. Our business model enables us to extract intragroup efficiencies and
synergies derived from operating across almost all stages of the vehicle life-cycle, at high volumes sufficient to
provide a level of information, liquidity and market recognition that drives further volume growth.

Our B2B Marketplace operates vehicle auctions that bring together vendors with a highly fragmented and
diverse buyer base. Our large, robust and transparent digital platforms combined with our full suite of preand post-auction digital and physical value-added services provide an efficient marketplace to facilitate the
exchange of used vehicles. B2B Marketplace sold approximately 1.5 million vehicles across the UK and
continental Europe in the fiscal year 2020. This significant scale creates a virtuous business cycle by providing
access to a wide variety and large volume of vehicles through our auctions, thereby attracting more buyers to
our platform and enabling optimum pricing and quick throughput, which in turn attracts more sellers and
provides more volumes. Moreover, we obtain valuable insights for our pricing engines based on the
information we have available about a vehicle and its condition, color, auction sale price and bid levels. The
B2B Marketplace benefits from multiple sourcing channels targeting different types of vendors.

The C2B Marketplace creates a highly complementary and enhancing growth engine to that of the B2B
Marketplace. The B2B Marketplace provides WeBuyAnyCar with a highly efficient route to dispose of the
vehicles it purchases from consumers (typically within 10 days) and, through WeBuyAnyCar, we have the
ability to purchase a greater volume and variety of vehicles, which directly helps supply the B2B Marketplace.
The Vehicle Buying division provides significant volumes to the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, having
accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold through the Marketplace in the UK in the fiscal year 2021. This
synergistic model, which leverages WeBuyAnyCar’s market share within the framework of our wider
marketplace, creates a platform which we believe would be difficult to replicate.

Our ability to dynamically source used vehicles combined with our knowledge and insights on pricing and
other demand side dynamics enable us to find an optimum and tailored match for buyers and sellers swiftly,
which is key in driving profitability per vehicle. This is further strengthened by the additional services we offer,
which increase consumer and vendor experience as well as help us generate greater profitability per vehicle.

Our scaled B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace provides our pricing model with over six million relevant
historic used vehicle transactions. This data enables us to accurately and efficiently price vehicles both upon
sourcing and sale. This scale is further supported by our Automotive Services business line and our full suite
of pre- and post-auction digital and physical value-added services. This completes the value chain allowing us
to cover the full life-cycle, deepen relationships with vendors and customers and maximize profitability per
vehicle. Moreover, our Automotive Services business line and our value-added services enable us to record


-----

information relating to vehicle condition, maintenance and upkeep, further contributing to the pricing model
and further supporting the reliability of pricing decisions.

With the launch of B2C Marketplace, outside the restricted group, we have further diversified our buyer and
vendor base as cinch acts as another buyer through our auction channel, thereby generating auction fees for
our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as additional income for our Automotive Services division.
Furthermore, cinch also generates additional supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that
are remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.”_

As the scale of each of the business lines has grown and has reached greater volumes and touch points, it has
contributed to the further growth of each of the business lines in a virtuous cycle. We believe we are the only
operator of digital used vehicle auctions in the UK and continental Europe that offers the scale and the range
of services we provide. Our advantages in scale, reputation, relationships, access to proprietary data as well as
our established infrastructure and logistics network, which we believe would be difficult for a competitor to
replicate.

**_Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation_**

We believe that our scale, unique business model, reputation and robust financial policies have contributed
significantly to our long-term financial resilience, attractive growth and cash flow generation profile. Despite
turbulent times such as the global financial crisis of 2008, we were able to consistently maintain and grow
volumes and our EBITDA metric (as defined and prepared on the basis of the accounting policies of the
relevant parent entity at the time), with such metric having grown at a CAGR of 14.3% from the fiscal year
ended December 2004 to fiscal year ended March 2020 and such metric divided by vehicle volumes sold in the
respective trading year having grown from £37 per vehicle sold to £137 per vehicle sold over the same period,
as shown in the following chart.

Our business model’s resilience to market shocks can be further evidenced by our strong organic performance.
For example, during the period between 2008 and 2010, we were able to grow volumes by 66,000 vehicles and
the applicable EBITDA metric by £24 million in a market backdrop of reduced used car transactions in the
UK, which fell from 8.3 million in 2008 to 8.0 million in 2009 before recovering to 8.1 million in 2010. Despite
a market backdrop of reduced used vehicle transactions during the fiscal year 2021, our volumes between
July 2020 and December 2020 were higher compared to the period between July 2019 and December 2019. In
times of a consumer downturn and due to rate of loss in value generally associated with used vehicles, liquidity
is of paramount importance to businesses as well as consumers.

Our business is also highly cash generative, having generated £145.9 million, £175.1 million and £202.7 million
of COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week
period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively. This strong cash


-----

generation is the result of our ability to grow our IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA while following a
disciplined approach to capital expenditure with the majority of sites being held on long term leases (excluding
WeBuyAnyCar retail locations) and most of our transporters and properties being refinanced through sale
and leaseback. Adjusted cash conversion (measured by subtracting Underlying Cash CAPEX from IAS 17
COVID Adjusted EBITDA and comparing the result to IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA) was 84%, 86%
and 87% in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the
52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively.

**_Attractive, Resilient and Underpenetrated Market_**

We operate in the used vehicle market across the UK and continental Europe which has grown consistently
since 2012, driven by a relatively stable vehicle parc churn and growing vehicle penetration rates. Vehicle
penetration rates are expected to continue to grow for most markets. In addition, the used car market is larger
and more stable than the new car market. The chart below sets out the volumes of used car sales and new car
sales in the UK between 2008 and 2020 as an example of the development of these market.

The European vehicle parc has exhibited a CAGR of approximately 1.7% over 2012 to 2019, currently
standing at approximately 320 million units as of 2020. As per projections from IHS, the European vehicle
parc is expected to exhibit approximately 0.8% CAGR over 2021 to 2026, driven by growth in the penetration
of vehicles per population. Assuming churn rates remain the same, this should support growth in the used car
market. See “Industry—Overview—UK and Continental European Vehicle Parc.”

In 2020, the European used car market was estimated to be worth €410 billion (Source: Roland Berger report
_(Apr-21)). Significant fragmentation of buyers and vendors across the UK and continental Europe helps to_
make exchanges a critical channel for both vendors and buyers. For example, the largest used car dealership in
the UK is limited to approximately 3% market share, while the largest continental European used car
dealership has a market share of less than 1% (Source: IHS and ICDP). In addition, online vehicle buying
services are still operating typically at low levels of overall market penetration (e.g., WeBuyAnyCar has ~4%
share of total UK used vehicle sales volumes, as of 2020).

The COVID 19 pandemic has also accelerated favorable structural trends affecting the markets in which we
operate. In particular, consumers have recently begun placing increased emphasis on the importance of
owning a car. This has been driven by a variety of different reasons, including people moving away from
urban areas due to the ability to work from home and a reluctance to rely entirely on public transport. In
addition, the lockdown measures imposed by governments and related closure of car dealerships has made
digital channels a principal means of conducting used car auctions. In particular, by the start of 2021 almost
all of our auctions were digital as the COVID 19 pandemic and related social distancing regulations accelerated
our digitalization plans and encouraged the adoption of digital auctions by our customers. This digital shift
allows us to reach a wider range of potential customers and has increased the amount of auctions being held,
reducing our daily sales’ costs and allowing us and our customers to receive more vehicle data. Finally, we also
benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push towards new technology,
including tighter emission controls, encourages vehicle owners to renew their vehicles, driving more exchanges.

**_Best-in-class Management Team with Successful Track Record of Delivery_**

We operate with a management team that has significant experience in the automotive sector and has a proven
track-record of executing value-accretive initiatives, whether organically or through acquisitions. Our
Executive Chairman, Avril Palmer-Baunack, has over 25 years’ executive experience with leading businesses
in the automotive, support services, industrial engineering and insurance services sectors, having previously
served as Executive Chairman and Deputy CEO of Stobart Group and CEO of Autologic Holdings, where


-----

she joined from Universal Salvage and also held the position of CEO. Avril was the founder of Haversham
Holdings plc in 2014 and led the acquisition and strategic build of the CA Group where she continues to lead
as Executive Chairman. Tim Lampert, our Chief Financial Officer, joined Autologic Holdings in 1997. Tim
joined Haversham Holdings plc in January 2015 for the purchase of the BCA Group from CD&R and the
subsequent acquisitions prior to the group being de-listed and sold to TDR in November 2019 and has
remained as CFO with the formation of the current CA Group. Together, our best-in-class management team
brings over 30 years of relationships with major participants across every layer of the UK and continental
European automotive sector both at the division and group levels, and more than 100 years of collective
experience in the industry across four managing directors as well as legacy knowledge from some of our
founders, who are still employed within our Vehicle Buying division.

Thanks to its extensive experience, our management team has a proven track record of delivery, with
applicable EBITDA growing from £86.0 million in the fiscal year 2014 to £200.8 million in the fiscal year 2020
(as presented under “—Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation”) through, among others,
the acquisition of multiple infrastructure and logistics businesses. During the same period, B2B Vehicle
Volume increased from 999,000 to 1,463,000. Since the fiscal year 2014, C2B Vehicle Volume also increased
from 144,000 to 321,000 vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, with an
annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most
recent three-month period), reflecting the COVID 19 restrictions on the business.

The track record of our senior management in delivering cost-effective organic scale growth and successfully
integrating acquisitions, is one of our key strengths in a complex and continually evolving industry. In
addition, our management is backed by TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm with an integrated
investment and operation team of 46 professionals with an average of 15 years of relevant experience and a
deep knowledge and track-record in the automotive industry via investments in LeasePlan, CarNext,
EuroGarages and International Car Washing Group. The TDR Capital team, together with management,
intends to continue our trajectory of consistent volume and profitability growth.

We have also created a strong culture of innovation and transparency, winning a number of industry awards
for technical innovation, including for BCA Dealer Pro and our website. We believe this has allowed us to
maintain a high retention rate of key staff and develop a workforce that is dedicated to delivering high-quality
services.

**_Platform Ideally Positioned for Growth_**

We believe our business platform is strategically positioned for growth in our markets through market share
gain from the consumer to consumer (“C2C”) and part-exchange markets (whereby consumers “trade-in”
their used vehicle directly to a dealer). The growth of C2B Marketplace supports the growth of our B2B
channel as WeBuyAnyCar provides us with used vehicles that would otherwise go to C2C markets or partexchanges and allows us to supply a greater volume and variety of vehicles to our B2B Marketplace.

We believe we can drive higher volumes through our auctions through continued market share gain and
higher auction penetration in the UK and continental Europe. Our relationships with businesses such as
LeasePlan or CarNext, including entering into exclusive service agreements that provide support for our
multi-channel strategy, further enhance our sourcing capabilities and drive growth in the vehicle remarketing
segment. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with LeasePlan.”Moreover,
by leveraging our “One Europe” strategy via more seamless cross-border transactions, we believe we can
create a truly pan-European B2B marketplace for future growth.

In addition, COVID 19 restrictions have accelerated consumers’ willingness to adopt digital purchasing as a
means to buy a car from current low levels, favoring the growth of online B2C retailers, such as cinch. Our
relationship with cinch has increased supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that are
remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Through cinch, we are also able to develop a B2C channel,_
which enhances our position as an end-to-end service provider. In particular, sales volumes for the B2C
channel increased from approximately 4,000 in October 2020 (based on a 7-day rolling annual run-rate) to
approximately 38,000 in May 2021.

**Our Strategies**

We seek to create value for stakeholders through organic growth, acquisitions and partnerships in the
automotive sector in the UK and continental Europe. We continue to work with major market participants to


-----

develop and adapt integrated solutions to solve and meet the needs of the participants across the automotive
sector, maximizing value for all stakeholders. To achieve this goal, we are focused on enhancing our competitive
advantage as an integrated end-to-end service provider, further expanding internationally, strengthening our
infrastructure and logistics network, capitalizing on favorable industry trends, continuing to enhance our data
capabilities and improving our operational efficiencies, cash flow and leverage.

**_Enhance our competitive advantage across the value chain as an integrated end-to-end service provider_**

We plan to drive growth by increasing our B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace penetration to increase
transaction volumes and scale across our geographies. The increase in scale will serve to provide even deeper
access to vehicles, as well as more pricing and vehicle information, and is expected to continue to solidify our
position as a leading operator of digital used vehicle auctions across the UK and the continental European
countries in which we operate. We also expect to continue leveraging upon and investing in our UK and
continental European network and infrastructure.

To further increase our scale, we intend to deepen our relationships with other participants in the used vehicle
ecosystem, including OEMs, leasing companies, finance companies and dealers, to improve access to used
vehicle supply and generate volumes. We plan to provide dealers with additional offerings that suit their
business models, to leverage the strength of WeBuyAnyCar’s brand to capture additional supply volumes as
consumers become increasingly willing to sell their vehicles through digital channels, and expand our reach to
serve customers through partnerships with other B2C platforms.

In order to maintain our competitive advantage across the value chain, we will leverage the close relationship
between our C2B Marketplace and B2B Marketplace and work on integrating further the insights and data
points we are able to collect at different stages, further supplemented by our data sharing agreement with
cinch. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Multiplying our
data touchpoints for vehicles entering our ecosystem will enable us to base our decisions on more precise and
efficient processes and pricing input.

We intend to continue to develop both our digital and physical service offerings to retain and grow the
customer base and deliver enhanced profitability. By increasing the penetration of value-added services over
time, we expect a compounding effect of fueling Marketplace growth by driving supply and buyer demand, as
the comprehensive end-to-end solutions significantly enhance user loyalty.

We also intend to further deepen the penetration of services provided by Automotive Services to continue to
improve relationships with vendors, both to provide additional vehicle information to benefit our other
divisions and to become the preferred choice for vehicle remarketing.

**_Further deliver on our international expansion strategy_**

We believe we are well positioned in Europe to become a truly pan-European leader in the used vehicle auction
market. Our “One Europe” strategy is focused on leveraging and optimizing our already existing capabilities
to provide more seamless cross-border transactions not only in countries where we have physical presence but
across the European continent. In continental Europe, which we believe is underpenetrated relative to more
developed markets such as the UK, we intend to grow our B2B Marketplace offering as well as our coordinated
logistics network and infrastructure to capture further market share and develop scale.

**_Strengthening our infrastructure and logistics network_**

As we look to increase our scale and continue to capture more volumes via our platforms, we will continue to
invest and strengthen our infrastructure and logistics capabilities in order to serve customers across the value
chain, while remaining asset light through the continued use of sale and leaseback transactions. We also
intend to develop and modernize our transport vehicles used for vehicle movement. Our aim is to remain a
major component of the UK used vehicle market backbone and extend this know-how to our other
geographies.

**_Capitalize on favorable structural industry trends to accelerate our growth_**

Online penetration for sales of used vehicles has grown significantly, particularly in the UK, in recent years
and the associated structural trends further accelerated during the COVID 19 pandemic. During the
COVID 19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in online penetration for sales of used vehicles, as
physical venues were shut for lockdown periods and social distancing restrictions and health concerns
otherwise caused many consumers to avoid physical venues. Despite the recent acceleration in online


-----

penetration growth, we believe the online used car market remains underpenetrated relative to other mass
retail markets such as markets for toys and games, consumer electronics and apparel.

Further enhancing our digital presence will also allow us to capitalize on additional structural trends that
could drive more volumes through our Marketplace and strengthen our positioning and market share on
both the supply and demand sides of the ecosystem. In particular, we believe that on the demand side
consumers will continue to favor used vehicles for individual transportation to avoid public transportation
systems, and that more vehicles will be necessary as consumers move away from city centers to areas where
public transportation is inconvenient or unavailable. On the demand side, we look to attract wider audiences
via our digital auctions with no limitations linked to historical physical sites.

Finally, we will seek to benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push
towards new technology, including towards electric and other alternative fuel sources for vehicles, encourages
vehicle owners to review their vehicles, driving more exchanges.

**_Continue to enhance our data capabilities_**

Our business model is built on leveraging data and technology and we intend to continue to invest in our IT
infrastructure and data capabilities to scale up along with volume growth. We use data and technology
throughout our business, from providing instant price quotes and targeted marketing campaigns to valuation
tools, logistics and inventory management to optimization of refurbishment costs.

Through our end-to-end positioning we have access to one of the largest pools of real-time data.

As such, we are invested in ensuring that our IT infrastructure remains state-of-the-art to secure better
knowledge of our customers and their needs, which in turn is expected to enable us to develop better products
and more tailored service as well as more accurate pricing which is expected to help underpin our profitability.

**_Increase our operational efficiencies and drive strong cash flow and deleveraging_**

As we look to increase volumes flowing through our Marketplace, we believe we will have an opportunity to
improve our profitability per vehicle. Driving continued penetration of automotive services will help maximize
the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies. Enhancing our data capabilities will allow us to
optimize pricing, leading to better unit economics, while we also look to ensure an optimal management of
our inventories to ensure a strong cash flow conversion at all times.

To support our strong cash generation, we will maintain our disciplined approach to cost management, which
proved to be effective in helping us navigate through the COVID 19 pandemic and its associated challenges,
maintaining an optimal capital structure and strong deleveraging profile while continuing in investing to grow
the business.


-----

**Operations**

We operate through three main business lines: (i) the B2B Marketplace business line, which is comprised of
our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying
division’s operations in continental Europe, (ii) the C2B Marketplace business line, which is WeBuyAnyCar,
our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, and (iii) the Automotive Services business line. These
business lines are interlinked, with the Vehicle Remarketing divisions re-selling all of the vehicles acquired by
the Vehicle Buying division and the Automotive Services division providing vehicle movement, logistics,
storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment services. Our
divisions are also interlinked through end-to-end data flows, in order to optimize the platform. At each vehicle
touch point throughout the value chain, data on the vehicle is collected which informs decisions on value,
condition and refurbishment requirements. We have a dedicated team of data scientists and have been able to
utilize their data pool to develop highly accurate pricing capabilities based on multiple vehicle parameters,
including age, mileage, color and condition, which enables us to maximize margins in real time. Today, more
than 6 million historic used vehicle transactions feed our pricing model, which empowers the broader
platform.

We have physical sites spanning the UK and across nine continental European countries, including in
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, Italy and Norway, but serve
customers across an even wider region. In the fiscal year 2020, we exported more than 70,000 vehicles from
our International Vehicle Remarketing division, to over 40 different countries. The diagram below sets out the
geographic presence of our physical remarketing operations as of March 28, 2021:

Constellation Sites

**_Vehicle Remarketing_**

Vehicle Remarketing is comprised of the UK Vehicle Remarketing division and the International Vehicle
Remarketing division. Together, these divisions operate close to accessible transport routes and facilitate the
exchange of used vehicles, having sold 1.2 million, 1.5 million and 1.4 million vehicles in the fiscal years 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively (with fiscal year 2021 being the period most adversely affected by the COVID 19
pandemic). In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, Vehicle Remarketing sold 1.4 million vehicles. Vehicle
Remarketing generated IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £119.7 million in the 52-week period ended March 28,
2021. Vehicle Remarketing operates primarily on an agency basis (in such role, taking no title or inventory
risk to the vehicles it transacts), except for our outsourced remarketing contracts which allow us to selectively
secure batches of supply. Vehicle Remarketing generates its revenue through a mix of vehicle transaction fees
and value-added service fees.

During the fiscal year 2020, approximately 37% of UK auctions were transacted online, however, by the start
of the fiscal year 2021 all our UK auctions were digital as the COVID 19 pandemic and related social
distancing regulations accelerated our digitalization plans and encouraged the acceptance of digital auctions
by our customers. While we retain the option to conduct one-off physical auctions for certain customers, we
will continue to focus on digital auctions. As a result, many of our physical sites are now being used for the
provision of storage and refurbishment services to our customers in support of our digital auctions. In
addition, the digital shift has increased auction capacity, reduced our daily sales’ costs and provides us with
more data.


-----

**_Auctions_**

Auctions are our core business activity. We auction vehicles of all ages and types, principally cars and light
commercial vehicles (“LCVs”), selling 1.4 million vehicles in the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, a period
adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, compared to 1.5 million in the fiscal year 2020. As part of
our auctions, transaction fees are charged per vehicle sold through the Marketplace and are received from
both buyers and vendors, with the vast majority generated from buyers. Vehicle Remarketing does not take
title to the majority of vehicles (with title instead passing from the vendor directly to the buyer).

Online auctions are conducted as real time online auction sales with the auctioneer providing descriptions to
the buyers and coordinating the auction. We also offer “eBay-style” longer-term online auctions in which
users can either purchase vehicles from our online catalogue at a pre-determined asking price (a “Buy Now”
service) or bid on vehicles during auctions that run for pre-set periods of time (a “Bid Now”service). Auctions
are conducted daily and both vendors and buyers benefit from their 24/7 access to online bidding and the
ability to search and compare vehicles from multiple locations and in multiple languages.

Auctions can be accessed using BCA Live Online or the BCA Buyer mobile application.

_BCA Live Online_

BCA Live Online broadcasts live video and audio to remote bidders via the Internet using technology
developed in-house, allowing online bidders to compete in real time.

Buyers can pre-plan their auction activity using our catalogue previews and the vehicle tracking functionality
on our BCA Buyer mobile application, allowing buyers to track in real-time when a vehicle will be up for live
auction. During a sale, a live messaging service allows buyers to engage directly with the auctioneers and there
is capability to follow up to four auction sales simultaneously. If buyers are unable to attend a given auction,
they are also offered the option to place concealed proxy bids, allowing them to place a set bid for a particular
vehicle in advance, prior to the end of the relevant auction.

BCA Live Online also allows potential buyers to view, bid on and ultimately purchase vehicles at auctions
across Europe from one location, eliminating the need to travel to physical auction sites.

_BCA Buyer Mobile Application_

Our BCA Buyer mobile application integrates with BCA Live Online to allow industry buyers to manage
their selections and bidding across platforms. Simple vehicle tracking takes the guesswork out of auction
timings, with prompted notifications automatically sent to buyers whose targeted vehicle is ten lots away. The
use of our BCA Buyer mobile application has increased over the past two years and it now offers the same
functionalities as BCA Live Online, including full bidding, buying, delivery, collection and payment journeys.

**_Vendors_**

The UK Vehicle Remarketing division’s vendors are divided into five main groups: (i) dealers, comprising 23%
of our volume for the fiscal year 2021, (ii) vehicle buying, comprising 35% of our volume for the fiscal year
2021, (iii) OEMs, comprising 7% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021, (iv) corporates, which include leasing
companies and OEM finance companies, comprising 21% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021 and (v) trade
and others, comprising 15% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021.

The majority of used vehicles in the wholesale market in key European geographies is generated by OEMs
and corporates, although there are some country-specific differences.

The majority of our sales arrangements with our vendors are framework agreements, renewed annually and
provide only pricing and service levels. The framework agreements do not guarantee the provision of a
minimum number of vehicles to us and typically do not commit the vendor to exclusively supply vehicles to
us. Nevertheless, we have a track record of vendor retention. As of March 28, 2021, we held long-term client
relationships with an impressive track record of retention of our customers; by vehicles sold, 13 of our top 18
vendors (excluding WeBuyAnyCar) have each worked with us for five or more years and ten of them have
worked with us for over ten years. In particular, for the fiscal year 2021, of the top 18 vendor relationships
(excluding WeBuyAnyCar) 77% of volume was contributed by vendors with a relationship over ten years.

_Dealers_

Dealer vendors are comprised of a large number of franchised and non-franchised dealers. Dealers typically
sell vehicles obtained through part-exchanges from consumers, as well as over-age stock that is no longer
suitable for their retail showrooms. As a result, dealers sell vehicles through us that typically are more than
five years old.


-----

_WeBuyAnyCar_

WeBuyAnyCar sells all of its vehicles through the Marketplace. See “—Vehicle Buying.” The age of vehicles
we sell varies widely.

_OEMs_

OEMs typically use the Marketplace to dispose of demo fleets, buy-backs from rental companies and
management vehicles. As a result, the vehicles sold by OEMs through us tend to be among the youngest sold
through the Marketplace and usually are less than two years old.

_Corporates_

Corporate vendors, including contract hire, leasing and finance companies, typically dispose of end-of-lease
or repossessed vehicles through the Marketplace. Leasing company vendors in particular typically seek to
liquidate vehicles that they no longer seek to lease (and thus view as liabilities) as quickly as possible through
the Marketplace. The supply of vehicles from corporate vendors is affected by the number of vehicles that
have reached the end of the life of their relevant underlying contracts (which are typically three to five years in
duration), and reflects the number of vehicles taken onto contract by such corporate vendors’ customers in
preceding years.

_Trade and others_

Trade and others are comprised of other companies that do not fall into the other main categories, such as
public sector suppliers, owned fleet and various other independent sellers of vehicles.

**_Buyers_**

Our buyer base is highly fragmented, comprising more than 25,000 active trade buyers (i.e., buyers who use
remarketing channels to source used vehicle inventory and intend to resell the purchased vehicle) as of
March 28, 2021. Our trade buyers are divided into two main groups: (i) franchised dealers, who use the
Marketplace and vehicles obtained from part-exchanges as a source to supplement inventory, and
(ii) independent dealers and wholesale traders. Our independent dealer buyers will make use of remarketing
companies for a constant supply of vehicles. Wholesale traders are dispersed through a large number of
individual and small companies which source vehicles from auctions and act as middlemen on behalf of other
buyers.

**_Value-Added Services_**

In addition to our core auction business, Vehicle Remarketing provides a wide spectrum of supplemental,
value-added digital and physical pre- and post-auction services to both vendors and buyers, ranging from
upstream services to pre-auction preparation and marketing products to post-auction logistics services. These
services enable vendors to select from a range of services to enhance the marketability of vehicles, thereby
facilitating their disposal process, while also improving the information available to buyers. Value-added
services have the additional benefit of enhancing customer retention rates within Vehicle Remarketing, as our
customers are able to obtain the wide range of services from a single source, as opposed to having to turn to
different providers for each service which results in additional costs and lead times to disposal. Value-added
service fees are charged depending on the particular type of service sold by Vehicle Remarketing. Some of the
value-added services within Vehicle Remarketing are also offered on a standalone basis as part of our
Automotive Services division, thereby affording us flexibility as to whether these services should be offered as
part of our remarketing offering or separately and allowing us to offer more bespoke solutions to our
customers based on their specific needs.

The chart below shows our services across the post-factory automotive market value chain.


-----

_Upstream Services_

In order to help dealers manage their part-exchanges, we have developed BCA Dealer Pro, an online
application that organizes and improves various stages of the part-exchange process. BCA Dealer Pro also
assists dealers in disposing of their vehicles through the Marketplace quickly and seamlessly, as the data
captured by BCA Dealer Pro is easily integrated into our auction platforms. The key services addressed by
BCA Dealer Pro are:

- data capture facilitating valuation—identifying the vehicle, conducting an appraisal, capturing retail-quality
images and obtaining an accurate valuation;

- stock management—managing dealer stock and inter-dealer allocations, providing data analysis tools and
retail inventory data feeds and assisting in stock liquidation and stock replacement;

- remarketing services—managing logistics, sales preparation and demand data;

- buyer services—providing transparent pricing, logistics and vehicle preparation; and

- merchandising—offering digital content upload, key retailing data, imaging and video.

In continental Europe, we have developed MarketPrice, a service that provides dealers with a valuation for
their part-exchange vehicles. MarketPrice is available at no charge to dealers, in exchange for a commitment
to sell part-exchange vehicles through the Marketplace. While BCA Dealer Pro and MarketPrice generate
relatively low revenue and are offered prior to any decision to sell a vehicle through the Marketplace, we
believe these online tools help to develop our relationship with vendors and incentivize them to provide
vehicles to the Marketplace for sale. We believe that vendors using these online applications are more likely to
subsequently provide a greater proportion of their vehicles to the Marketplace for sale, thus increasing the
number of vehicles sold through the Marketplace.

_Pre-auction Services_

Once a vendor has decided to sell a vehicle through the Marketplace, we provide vendors with a fully integrated
vehicle pre-auction service.

We offer vehicle collection and transportation services, primarily in the UK, to move vendors’ vehicles to the
Marketplace (or, if requested, to third-party de-fleeting locations). We also provide vendors with storage
services prior to the auction. Moreover, we organize both single and multiple vehicle collections, varying
pricing depending on the distance and number of vehicles moved. We utilize a combination of our own fleet
of transporters and contracted plate drivers, as well as third-party companies (that provide their own
transporters and plate drivers).

When a vehicle arrives at our facilities, we undertake a standardized appraisal of the vehicle’s condition to
help the vendor set an appropriate reserve price and ensure an accurate and consistent vehicle description is
provided to auction participants. Depending on a vehicle’s condition, Vehicle Remarketing offers a range of
services to vendors designed to improve a vehicle’s condition and maximize its resale value, as many buyers
seek ready-to-retail vehicles. For more extensive repair needs, Vehicle Remarketing offers Smart Repair, our
repair service that includes cosmetic improvements, body work, dent repair, light mechanical repair, glass
repair and tire replacement.

Following any valet or repair services performed on a vehicle, we are able to capture high-quality photographs
and video for display on BCA Auction View, the online search tool used by buyers across the Marketplace.


-----

BCA Auction View provides our buyers with free access to the search capability, including all vehicles
scheduled for sale through the Marketplace. We have organized our search function to allow potential buyers
to search and view vehicles by make, age, grade, fuel, color, transmission and several other criteria. In addition,
BCA Auction View provides users with comprehensive vehicle data, including images, videos and appraisal
reports. Our video streaming and software development subsidiary, AutosOnShow, further enhances our
offering by providing imaging services to dealers following the sale of a vehicle, thereby allowing such dealers
to market the vehicle with their own branding prior to taking physical delivery of the vehicle.

Through BCA Assured, we provide buyers with additional comfort on the condition of vehicles that would
typically be sold “as seen” at our auctions. BCA Assured is a 40+point mechanical appraisal carried out by
certified technicians on all vehicles within certain mileage and ownership conditions. During the appraisal,
our technicians asses each vehicle in accordance with a comprehensive auction grid that takes into account a
number of cosmetic and technical requirements and produce an imaging suite, following which our dedicated
algorithm grades each vehicle for valuation purposes. The BCA Assured check is offered as an additional
service that accompanies a bid and is designed to give potential buyers confidence to buy despite an inability
to road test vehicles. The BCA Assured inspection covers a wide range of checks from condition of tires, to
engine performance and brake checks. Buyers of BCA Assured-covered vehicles have the earlier of 48 hours
or 500 miles to contact us if a vehicle’s condition has been misreported, with our dispute resolution team
working with buyers to resolve any claims.

_Post-auction Services_

Following a vehicle’s sale, we provide buyers with both storage and delivery services to the vehicle’s final
destination.

Through BCA Partner Finance, we offer stock funding (trade finance) to certain registered dealers in the UK,
which incrementally enhances the liquidity of the buyer base, thereby stimulating further demand within the
Marketplace. For eligible customers, our buyer finance services can be used to fully fund vehicle purchases of
all grades, including auction costs and ancillary fees. Typically, we provide finance support to established
buyers that are pre-approved and have a specified credit limit. As a result, and due to our close relationship
with these buyers and the use of our proprietary credit scoring process, we are well-positioned to assess the
credit risk of our borrowers and as such default rates and bad debt for BCA Partner Finance is low.

Financing is provided for an initial period of 60 days, with a possible 60-day extension, and is secured by the
financed vehicle (in the form of a security marker on such vehicle) as well as personal guarantees. If a dealer
defaults on its interest or principal payment, we have the right to recover the financed vehicle. However,
typically, we receive repayment once a vehicle is re-sold by the buyer.

Part-funding for BCA Partner Finance is provided by the Receivables Facility, as defined in and described
under “Description of Other Financial Arrangements—Receivables Facility Agreement.”

**_Vehicle Buying_**

Our Vehicle Buying division operates primarily in the UK as part of the C2B Marketplace, through
WeBuyAnyCar, but also operates in continental Europe, where it focuses on purchasing batches of vehicles
from corporates as part of the B2B Marketplace. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Vehicle
Buying division generated IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £44.0 million.

**_WeBuyAnyCar_**

In the UK, we conduct our Vehicle Buying operations through our trusted digital brand, WeBuyAnyCar. The
service has over 100,000 Trust Pilot reviews, and an overall “Excellent” rating, which is testament to the
strength and reputation of the WeBuyAnyCar brand. WeBuyAnyCar purchases and thereby provides us with
used vehicles owned by private consumers that would otherwise be destined for the consumer-to-consumer or
part-exchange markets. Through our online pricing quotation system and our 357 physical locations across
the UK as of March 28, 2021, we purchase any used vehicle owned by a private consumer, irrespective of
vehicle make, model, age or condition after having done our customary vehicle inspections. In the fiscal year
2021, a period adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, WeBuyAnyCar purchased and sold 300,000
vehicles from consumers in the UK. Run-rate total number of vehicles purchased and sold through
WeBuyAnyCar are estimated to be approximately 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and
May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period).


-----

Our Vehicle Buying division targets sellers who are seeking a fast, safe and convenient alternative to sell their
used vehicles at a competitive price. We also provide sellers with a quick source of liquidity.

_WeBuyAnyCar Sale Process_

WeBuyAnyCar’s website (www.webuyanycar.com) is the first point of interaction for most of the Vehicle
Buying division’s sellers. We have built and continue to maintain the WeBuyAnyCar brand through television,
radio and Internet advertising campaigns. WeBuyAnyCar’s website attracted approximately 22.7 million
unique visitors in the fiscal year 2021. The website’s key feature is its ability to use a proprietary pricing engine
that analyzes various vehicle parameters to provide an initial valuation of a vehicle virtually instantly. As a
result, we believe that WeBuyAnyCar is able to provide competitive valuations to its sellers.

In the fiscal year 2021, WeBuyAnyCar provided a total of 15.6 million valuations. Having obtained an initial
valuation of their vehicle online, potential sellers are invited to schedule an appointment at one of
WeBuyAnyCar’s 357 retail branches located across the UK, with appointments available as early as the same
day. Potential sellers may also bring their vehicles direct to a WeBuyAnyCar branch, without first accessing its
website, to obtain a quote on their vehicle.

WeBuyAnyCar’s branches are open for both online appointments and walk-in valuations up to seven days a
week, and on average a WeBuyAnyCar customer lives within a 14-minute drive of a WeBuyAnyCar branch.
At the in-branch appointment, a WeBuyAnyCar representative inspects the vehicle to confirm that the online
description and specifications provided by the potential seller (if applicable) were accurate and checks for
other mechanical and cosmetic damage to the vehicle. The WeBuyAnyCar representative then issues a final
offer price to the potential seller to buy the vehicle. The entire in-person sale process is typically completed
within 30 minutes. After a seller accepts WeBuyAnyCar’s offer price, WeBuyAnyCar cross-checks the vehicle
against vehicle databases and confirms the seller’s ownership. WeBuyAnyCar then arranges for the transfer of
ownership and payment of the agreed purchase price for the vehicle is made by bank transfer. For an
additional fee, WeBuyAnyCar will make an expedited payment transfer of the net purchase payment to the
seller. WeBuyAnyCar deducts a transaction fee from the final sale price paid to the sellers of the vehicles it
purchases.

All of the vehicles purchased by WeBuyAnyCar are sold through the UK Vehicle Remarketing division.
WeBuyAnyCar is the UK Vehicle Remarketing division’s largest vendor, providing 35% of the vehicles sold
through us in the fiscal year 2021. In the fiscal year 2020, which is representative of our ordinary course
business operations in a steady state, vehicles in the UK were onwards sold within approximately 10 days
through the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, while in the fiscal year 2021, as a result of the COVID 19
pandemic, onwards sales took place at an average of approximately 20 days.

**_Continental Europe_**

In continental Europe, our Vehicle Buying division focuses on purchasing batches of vehicles from corporates,
providing a controlled supply, adding mix and diversity to auction inventory in the International Vehicle
Remarketing division.

**Automotive Services**

In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Automotive Services division generated IAS 17 Adjusted
EBITDA of £12.5 million.

With a national network of sites, the Automotive Services division brings together our automotive vehicle
movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting and refurbishment
services, providing a comprehensive suite of services in an integrated manner. The division continues to
increase the penetration of internal moves and refurbishment completed for the UK Vehicle Remarketing
division and WeBuyAnyCar, driving increased internal efficiency and reducing costs. Under our Automotive
Services division, we aim to act as a one-stop shop for the passage of vehicles throughout their life and
capture auction volumes earlier in the life-cycle by working directly with specific vendors, such as fleet
providers and OEMs. By locking in a relationship with vendors at the start of the car’s life cycle, we not only
expand our opportunity for revenue streams along the value chain but also place ourselves to be a potential
route of remarketing when the vehicle comes off lease or rolls out of the fleet.

As part of the Automotive Services division, we handle bulk vehicle movements to and from ports,
manufacturing centers, pre-delivery inspection facilities, storage and refurbishment centers, auction sites and
dealerships, on behalf of our third party customers, the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, BCA Partner


-----

Finance customers and WeBuyAnyCar. Collected vehicles are driven on transport vehicles to secure central
hub locations and the movement between hubs is performed by the transporter fleet. This hub and spoke
network reduces driver hours, the risks to vehicles, general wear and tear and allows us to maximize the use of
capacity in under-utilized or empty return legs. In addition, movement between hubs can occur overnight
when the road network is less congested and external customers’ sites are not operational.

Continued investment has resulted in a modern and efficient fleet of transporters, improving operational
comfort for our employees and reliability for our customers. As of March 28, 2021, we operated a leading UK
transporter fleet, comprising 901 trucks capable of providing bulk vehicle movements, thereby connecting the
physical marketplace and increasing the integration between our divisions. In the fiscal year 2021, our in-house
transporter fleet and sub-contractors organized by us moved 1.8 million vehicles in bulk and accounted for
94% of transport arranged by the UK Vehicle Remarketing division. We also offer single vehicle movements,
customer handover specialists and vehicle inspection and collection services as well as trade plate movements
for LCVs. In the fiscal year 2021, our single vehicle movements amounted to a further 563,000 vehicles moved.

Furthermore, as part of our Automotive Services offering, we provide new vehicle support to customers from
factory gate or port of entry to fleet or retail availability. Such services include reception, customs management
and handling at port or factory gate, pre-delivery inspection and new vehicle preparation, accessory fitment
and customization, warranty and servicing as well as storage and compound management.

We also offer specialist services in fleet management, de-fleet and refurbishment. Our fleet management
expertise gives us the capabilities to offer customers full service fleet management solutions, providing
consistently high levels of customer service and peace of mind for fleet customers, including (i) booking,
management and administration, (ii) preparation, maintenance and storage, (iii) document management and
reporting and (iv) handover, inspection and collection services. Our de-fleet and refurbishment services include
(i) inspection and estimation services, (ii) refurbishment, (iii) service and warranty, (iv) studio quality imaging,
(v) valet and secure storage and (vi) wheel refurbishment. These services are delivered to consistent standards,
at scale, and cost-effectively. In the fiscal year 2021, we utilized the capability and expertise developed in
preparing and refurbishing fleet vehicles to establish and support the newly-developed “Retail Ready”industry
vehicle standard. “Retail Ready”vehicles are cosmetically and mechanically prepared to be immediately placed
for sale to consumers and are therefore particularly attractive to online car dealers.

Some of our services within the Automotive Services division are also cross-sold to our UK Vehicle
Remarketing division, thereby affording us flexibility as to whether these services should be directly offered to
the customer or cross-sold to another division and allowing us to offer more bespoke solutions to our
customers based on their specific needs.

**Information Technology**

We depend on our IT function to support our operating divisions and our back-office functions. We maintain
a large number of IT staff across the UK and continental Europe, which are organized into the following
areas: Technology Operations, Product, Information Security & Business Continuity, Enterprise Applications,
Transport & Logistics, Architecture, CTO and Portfolio Management. These teams cover all operating
divisions, both in the UK and continental Europe. We also rely on a small number of strategic partners to
supply, deliver and support some of our key technologies, supplementing our internal teams capabilities and
providing us with capacity and flexibility to adapt with business demand. Our technology is split between
hosted third-party data centers and public cloud infrastructure. Our systems and products consist of a mixture
of commercial off-the-shelf and bespoke developed platforms, and are categorized as follows:

- Digital auctions: our digital auctions are focused on the development of our end-to-end auction e-commerce
journey. Our core Auction Information System (the “AIS”) is used to manage vehicles through the physical
processes at our physical remarketing locations, manage physical stock, compound management, sale
channel allocation, bid management and, within the UK, for invoicing to customers. The AIS integrates
with our other information technology systems and products.

The main buyer interfaces are the BCA Auction View website and the BCA Buyer mobile application in the
UK and the pan-European e-commerce Platform (PEEP) in continental Europe. These allow buyers to
search our stock, manage their interest, purchases and payments online and link seamlessly with our online
auction system, BCA Live Online, which provides real-time online buying to all our auctions. These systems
support buyers in their local language, currency and delivery requirements and can be provided as White
Label, which are vendor-branded auction platforms.


-----

- Inspections, appraisal and valuations: we are focused on the development and maintenance of our range of
tools to capture vehicle condition for inspection, appraisal and valuation purposes at different parts of the
group such as WeBuyAnyCar, dealer and online part-exchanges, lease collections, fleet returns and
remarketing locations. We are working to bring these tools into a common system that can provide all the
data required for the entire vehicle journey at the first touch point.

- Vehicle lifecycle management: through BCA Dealer Pro, we provide a toolset that allows us and our large
corporate vendors to manage vehicles in the transition between the de-fleet and remarketing stages of their
lifecycle, streamlining processes and providing data-driven insights that enable better decision-making for
the customer and ensures easy integration into our suite of products and services.

- Transport and logistics: the specialist transport systems that underpin our cross-divisional logistics capability
are key to maximizing our efficiency in order to meet the needs of our customers and of our divisions. Our
transport and logistics products support the planning, optimization and orchestration of both singlevehicle and multi-vehicle movements, both intra-divisionally and to or from external customers.

- WeBuyAnyCar: we have developed a suite of bespoke products that allow for the smooth and efficient
operation of the WeBuyAnyCar business from the point at which a customer visits our website to the
moment the purchase is completed and monies are transferred. These products provide the website and
valuation and quoting system, as well as the various tools in use across the retail estate with which the
WeBuyAnyCar staff assesses, values and purchases vehicles from the general public.

- BCA Partner Finance: we use a commercial, off-the-shelf software that is integrated within our AIS and
allows us to provide finance for qualifying customers and the purchases they make.

**Marketing**

**_Vehicle Remarketing_**

The main purpose of the marketing team is to promote the Marketplace and its related services to both
vendors and buyers in collaboration with the sales and operational teams. Customer service is part of the
function. In addition, our sales teams seek to maintain and develop relationships with existing vendors.

Our Vehicle Remarketing divisions trade under the BCA brand name, which is well known in the UK, having
traded for more than 70 years. Our efforts at maintaining and promoting our brand are focused on growing
BCA brand awareness in continental Europe and raising awareness of the breadth of our products and services
portfolio.

Vehicle Remarketing targets buyers to purchase vehicles across its digital platforms and holds an extensive
database of historic customer-buying behavior and preferences. Buyers are targeted based on their existing
and potential purchasing opportunity across the facets of vehicle make, model, age, mileage, type, price,
location, sales and channel characteristics. Vehicle Remarketing’s marketing campaigns integrate print and
digital media, direct mail and e-mail marketing and telemarketing, as appropriate.

New developments across Vehicle Remarketing’s digital channels increase the opportunity to sell vehicles
online by providing greater confidence to potential online buyers. We continually develop new products and
services for use by both vendors and buyers. Digital initiatives include improved vehicle imagery and data for
search functions and improved user experience for online and mobile applications. Value-added services such
as BCA Dealer Pro and BCA Partner Finance have also expanded Vehicle Remarketing’s product marketing
capability.

Vehicle Remarketing has an extensive database of vendor, buyer and vehicle transactional data. This data
provides insight on auction pricing trends and assesses other trends within the Marketplace, providing greater
insight on product value-add and buyer behavior, thereby creating opportunities to attract new customers and
optimize the performance of the Marketplace.

**_Vehicle Buying_**

The Vehicle Buying division’s marketing strategy focuses on driving volume growth and strengthening brand
reputation through a variety of tools, such as search engine marketing (“SEM”), conversion rate optimization,
relationship marketing and commercial analytics. Maintaining and increasing WeBuyAnyCar’s brand strength
is a key marketing goal of the Vehicle Buying division.

The Vehicle Buying division conducts advertising campaigns on TV, radio and the internet to increase web
traffic by vehicle owners looking to dispose of their vehicles. It also has a strong relationship with Google and


-----

has benefited from priority access to performance enhancing SEM-beta programs. The Vehicle Buying
division regularly analyses its media spend across TV, radio and the Internet to increase the efficiency of these
marketing activities.

**Intellectual Property**

Our intellectual property rights include proprietary technology and software relating to digital auction systems
as well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property. Our increased reliance in
recent years on proprietary Internet-based programs and technology have increased the relative importance
of intellectual property assets to our business. Our business and IT systems and other key proprietary
intellectual property generally are not protected by patents or registered design rights. As a result, we are
reliant on trademarks, copyright, database rights, registered domain names and the law protecting confidential
information to protect our brands, technologies and databases.

**Real Estate**

The majority of our operating properties in the UK (excluding WeBuyAnyCar retail locations) are subject to
long-term leases, which are recognized under IFRS 16 in our results of operations. The retail locations
operated by WeBuyAnyCar are small in size and are typically subject to a contractual term of less than
five years in duration. We also hold limited freehold properties in the UK. In continental Europe, our real
estate holdings comprise a mix of freehold and leasehold properties. In new markets, we tend to seek shorterterm leases to afford ourselves with greater operational flexibility.

**Health and Safety**

We are committed to providing a safe working environment wherever we operate, employing a proactive
network of health and safety professionals who deliver training and share knowledge and experience with the
aim of fostering best practice and ensuring consistently high standards of safety across our group. Health and
safety managers and committees are responsible for monitoring and reporting adherence to our health and
safety protocols to their divisional leaders.

The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business with regards
to the health and safety of our employees, customers and suppliers. We are committed to ensuring that our
working environments are safe and the measures taken in response to the COVID 19 pandemic meet the
requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Our operations are subject to various health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions
in which we operate, including those governing the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air or water,
the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and
remediation of contamination. Large numbers of vehicles are stored and prepared for sale at our facilities and
during that time releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. Furthermore, at our physical
locations, our employees come into close contact with moving vehicles.

**Environmental, Social and Governance**

With respect to environmental, social and governance matters, we have worked with Transport for London to
run ultra-low emission compliant auctions to highlight the launch of the low emission area in London. We
have seen an increase in the numbers of vehicles that are electric or hybrid coming into auctions, and in 2021
we switched the UK Vehicle Remarketing division to an electricity supplier which provides 100% renewable
electricity generated from wind, hydro and solar power (commencing October 1, 2021). Furthermore, our
transporter fleet includes trucks equipped with automatic gear changing systems that assist the driver by
selecting the most appropriate and efficient gear.

We have committed to charitable causes through fundraising activities and donations including a virtual oneday charity cycle and providing financial support to Ben, a non-profit organization supporting automotive
industry employees. We have significantly increased our number of mental health first aiders, partnering with
Mental Health England. We also have a strong focus on improving the capability of our people through
providing career development opportunities and ongoing training, offering our employees counselling and
well-being support through our new employee assistance programme and online well-being center.

We have in place a robust framework of governance and compliance underpinned by core values, abiding by
enhanced annual reporting disclosure obligations placed upon portfolio companies and private equity in
conformity with “The Walker Guidelines.” The six “Wates Principles” are key areas of focus for us, including:


-----

purpose and leadership, board composition, directors’ responsibilities, opportunity and risk, remuneration,
and stakeholder relationships and engagement. In addition, we encourage diversity and are committed to
providing equal opportunities within the workplace.

**Insurance**

The principal risks covered by our insurance policies relate to property damage, business interruption,
employers and public liability and certain other claims consistent with customary practice in the industry in
which we operate. We purchase our insurance through well-known providers. We have not had any material
insurance claims, nor have we suffered any material loss following any uninsured claim, in the fiscal years
2021, 2020 and 2019.

**Employees**

For the year ended March 28, 2021, we had an average of 7,365 employees, of which 6,440 were based in the
UK. We also use a number of self-employed drivers for the provision of transport services within our
Automotive Services division.

We are subject to various laws that regulate wages (including minimum wage laws), hours, benefits and other
terms and conditions relating to employment in the various countries in which we operate, and we provide
benefits to employees as required by applicable law.

We are committed to supporting our staff throughout their careers and provide training to a number of our
employees through our graduate development program and apprenticeship opportunities. We strive to make
working for our group rewarding in every sense. We always target competence and potential in our recruiting
process, and then support our employees with the training and development necessary to reach their full
potential. We also use bonus schemes as a part of employee compensation to incentivize efficiency, with
performance-based bonuses representing significant components of the compensation for many managementlevel employees.

We participate in several defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and in certain continental European
countries as well as two defined benefit pension plans in the UK. The two defined benefit pension plans in the
UK provide benefits based on final pensionable salary, are registered with HMRC and comply with the
regulatory framework published by the UK pensions regulator. Benefits are paid to the members from a
separate fund administered by independent trustees.

Our total contribution to these defined contribution schemes in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021
was £6.4 million. As of March 28, 2021, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK had a deficit of
£12.4 million (2020: £15.1 million). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We have several
_defined contribution pension schemes in certain continental European countries as well as two defined benefit_
_pension plans in the UK, some of which are in deficit.”_

**Litigation**

We have been and, from time to time, may continue to become party to claims, proceedings and lawsuits
incidental to the ordinary course of our business.

We are not currently involved in any other legal or arbitration proceedings that are expected to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position and, to our knowledge, no such legal or arbitration proceedings are
currently threatened.

our boards of directors and their respective private interests. Certain members of the boards of directors of
the Parent and Constellation Automotive are representatives of TDR Capital, which is our indirect majority
shareholder. In certain situations, the interests of TDR Capital, as indirect majority shareholder, may differ

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

We enter into transactions with our shareholders and other entities owned by, or affiliated with, our direct
and indirect shareholders in the ordinary course of business on fair terms and at arm’s length. These
transactions include, among others, professional advisory, consulting and other corporate services. The
following discussion is a brief summary of certain material arrangements, agreements and transactions we
have with related parties, including our ultimate shareholders, management personnel and cinch.

**Key Management Personnel**

**_Management Compensation_**

We provide our key management personnel with short-term employee benefits and post-employment benefits.
See “Management—Compensation.”

**_Management Incentive Program_**

Selected key employees of our management, including the members of the Executive Board, have been
provided an opportunity to make an indirect investment alongside TDR under the existing management
equity program (the “Management Incentive Program”). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the
managers participating in the Management Incentive Plan held less than 2% of the capital stock in the Parent.
This investment is held indirectly via a management holding company. See “Principal Shareholders.”

**Agreements with cinch**

During the fiscal years 2019 and 2020, we developed cinch in-house as an online classifieds business. During
the fiscal year 2020, cinch was sold to an affiliate of a parent company of the Parent in September 2020.
Subsequently, the cinch entities received further investment from our common parent company to transform
them from a classifieds business to a fully transactional online B2C marketplace for used vehicles.

On October 23, 2020, we entered into various operational agreements with cinch on arm’s length terms. Under
such agreements, we have agreed to grant cinch priority access to purchase our “Retail Ready” vehicles at a
fixed price. Such “Retail Ready”vehicles refers to cosmetically and mechanically prepared vehicles that can be
immediately sold by cinch through their consumer car-buying platform. Any “Retail Ready” vehicle passed
over by cinch is then made available to cinch partner dealers and then sold through our Bid Now platform or
in an open auction.

In addition, we have entered into an agreement to purchase part-exchange vehicles from cinch at a predetermined price. Under this arrangement cinch is required to purchase the vehicle from its customers at the
valuation price specified by our proprietary BCA DealerPro software. We purchase vehicles from cinch for a
price equal to 97.5% of the part-exchange valuation offered to cinch’s customers, provided that the BCA
DealerPro software was used to calculate the value of the customer’s vehicle at the time of first valuation.

We also benefit from a synergetic data-sharing agreement with cinch, which takes the form of a reciprocal
license.

Furthermore, we have entered into service agreements and vehicle sales agreements pursuant to which we
provide certain automotive services (such as vehicle storage, vehicle delivery and vehicle handover to cinch
customers) as well as professional services (such as financial and tax services, payroll and HR support, data
protection and IT services), and pursuant to which we act as exclusive remarketing agent for vehicles cinch
wants to dispose of, as applicable.

**Agreements with LeasePlan**

In December 2020, British Car Auctions Limited (“BCA”) entered into a services agreement with
LeasePlan UK Limited, a subsidiary of LeasePlan Corporation N.V., the largest indirect shareholder of which
is an affiliate of investment funds managed by TDR.

Under the terms of the agreement, BCA provides fully outsourced and managed services in relation to all
de-fleeting vehicles of LeasePlan UK Limited on arm’s length terms. The services are fulfilled through BCA
sub-contracting to BCA Outsource Solutions Limited (“BCAOS”) in respect of the acquisition of the bulk of
the de-fleeting vehicles. BCAOS then sells the vehicles on through a multi-channel remarketing program.


-----

Exceptions to this acquisition arrangement are (i) the driver sales program, which is fulfilled by BCA
Remarketing Solutions Limited (“BCARS”) under a separate agreement completed in May 2021 (at which
time the existing driver sales agreement between BCARS and LeasePlan UK Limited was terminated) and
(ii) vehicles which do not meet the purchasing criteria of BCAOS and so are not eligible for acquisition by
BCAOS. Under the terms of the agreement, BCA remarkets those ineligible vehicles via auction and takes
flash title at the point of sale at auction. In addition, to support BCA and BCAOS, BCA Logistics Limited
provides logistics services on an exclusive basis in respect of LeasePlan’s de-fleeting vehicles. The agreement
includes certain mutual indemnity provisions, including indemnities for any damage or loss resulting from a
breach of any obligations relating to intellectual property rights, data protection and confidentiality clauses
contained in the agreement.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS**

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for credit facilities in the amount of a £785,000,000 (equivalent)
senior term loan facility (the “Senior Term Facilities”), which will be drawn in full by way of pound sterling
and/or euro denominated cash advances in connection with the Transaction and a £250,000,000 senior
multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Senior Term Facilities are to be
used for the refinancing and discharge of existing indebtedness of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, to
make a distribution to the direct parent company of the Parent and to fund transaction costs. The Revolving
Credit Facility may be drawn by way of cash advances or the issue of letters of credit or ancillary facilities.
The Revolving Credit Facility is to be used for the refinancing an discharge of existing indebtedness of the
Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, to fund transaction costs and the general corporate purposes and
working capital purposes of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries.

In addition, the Parent may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional
tranches of the Senior Facilities (the “Senior Incremental Facilities”). The Parent and the lenders in respect of
the Senior Incremental Facilities may agree to certain terms in relation to the Senior Incremental Facilities,
including the margin and the termination date (subject to parameters as set out in the Senior Facilities
Agreement). The indebtedness incurred under the Senior Incremental Facilities must be otherwise permitted
under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Maturity and Availability_**

The Senior Term Facilities mature on the date falling 84 months after Issue Date. The Revolving Credit
Facility matures on the date falling 66 months after Issue Date. The Revolving Credit Facility is available to be
drawn from and including closing date to and including one (1) month prior to its maturity date.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Senior Term Facilities initially bear interest at a per annum rate to be determined. Loans
under the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest at a per annum rate to be determined and (in the case
of utilizations in euro) EURIBOR or (in the case of utilizations in U.S. dollar) LIBOR or (in the case of
utilizations in pound sterling) SONIA, as applicable.

The margin for each loan under the Senior Term Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility will be
subject to adjustment by reference to the applicable consolidated senior secured leverage ratio.

The margin on any loans under a Senior Incremental Facility will be agreed between the Parent and the
relevant lenders.

If EURIBOR, LIBOR or SONIA (as applicable) is less than zero, EURIBOR, LIBOR or SONIA (as
applicable) shall be deemed to be zero in respect of any loan under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

Commitment fees are payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility for the relevant periods set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement at a rate of 30% of the applicable
margin. Generally, the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrear, on the last day of availability of the
Revolving Credit Facility and if cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment
under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time such cancelation is effective.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on any overdue amount. The Parent is also
required to pay (or procure the payment of) customary agency and arrangement fees in connection with the
Senior Facilities.

**_Repayment_**

All outstanding amounts under the Senior Facilities are required to be repaid on the relevant maturity
dates referred to above. Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid on the last day of the
interest period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against new loans under the Revolving Credit
Facility to be drawn on such date.

The termination date in respect of a Senior Incremental Facilities will be the date agreed between the
Parent and the relevant lenders.


-----

**_Prepayment_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum amount and
certain conditions). A voluntary prepayment of the Senior Term Facilities, or an amendment of its terms, in
each case in connection with a re-pricing in the first six months after closing date may trigger a prepayment
fee as set out and calculated in the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The Senior Facilities Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all
amounts due to that lender upon a change of control of the Parent or a sale of the whole or substantially the
whole of the business and assets of the restricted group. Pursuant to the asset disposition covenant, the Senior
Facilities Agreement also requires the Parent to prepay the Senior Facilities with the net proceeds received
from certain disposals (subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights).

**_Guarantees_**

The Senior Facilities are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer.

The Senior Facilities Agreement includes a “Guarantor Coverage Threshold” (being, subject to certain
exceptions, the requirement that the consolidated EBITDA of the Guarantors represents not less than 80% of
the consolidated EBITDA of the restricted group excluding any member of the restricted group that is not
required to become a guarantor in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles). If the Guarantor
Coverage Threshold is not met when tested by reference to delivery of the annual financial statements of the
Parent for the relevant year, within 60 days each Material Company that is not already a guarantor (together
with such other members of the restricted group as necessary) shall become guarantors under the Senior
Facilities Agreement in order to meet the Guarantor Coverage Threshold at that time. “Material Company”
is generally defined under the Senior Facilities Agreement to include, among other things, any member of the
restricted group that is incorporated or established in a Security Jurisdiction and that has earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing more than 5% of consolidated EBITDA of the
restricted group. “Security Jurisdiction” is defined in the Agreed Security Principles as being (i) England and
Wales, and (ii) any other jurisdiction in which, based upon the most recent annual financial statements
delivered under the Senior Facilities Agreement, members of the restricted group incorporated in that
jurisdiction (disregarding the earnings from ordinary activities before interest, taxation, depreciation,
amortization and exceptional items (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis)
(“Jurisdiction Entity EBITDA”) of any such member of the restricted group that generates negative
Jurisdiction Entity EBITDA) account for 15 per cent. or more of consolidated EBITDA of the restricted
group. The Agreed Security Principles provide that no member of the restricted group incorporated or
established outside of a Security Jurisdiction shall be required to provide any guarantee or security (unless
such member is a borrower of a Senior Facility) and no member of the restricted group shall be required to
provide any security in respect of any shares or other ownership interests held in any member of the restricted
group incorporated or established outside of a Security Jurisdiction or any member of the restricted group
which is not an obligor under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Security_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement is secured by the same security interests granted as security for the
Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.”

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties (subject to
certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being repeated),
including status, binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, validity and
admissibility in evidence and authorizations, governing law and enforcement, insolvency, no default, no
misleading information, financial model and accounts, disputes and litigation, compliance with laws,
environmental compliance, taxation, security and indebtedness, title to assets, share capital, pensions,
intellectual property, group structure, pari passu ranking, sanctions and anti-corruption laws and insurances.

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related definitions
(with certain adjustments) that are included in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants”_


-----

The Senior Facilities Agreement also requires certain members of the restricted group to observe certain
affirmative covenants, including covenants relating to maintenance of authorizations, compliance with laws,
environmental compliance, payment of taxes, preservation of intellectual property, pari passu ranking, funding
of pensions, maintenance of insurances, further assurance with respect to security interests granted, sanctions
and anti-corruption, access upon an event of default, maintenance of a credit rating, maintenance of
Guarantor Coverage Threshold on an annual basis (see “—Guarantees” above), as well as a limitation on
speculative hedging transactions.

In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement contains a financial covenant for the benefit of the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility (see “—Financial Covenant”).

Certain of the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be suspended including upon an
initial public offering where the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio is equal to or less than 3.50:1, or
upon the Parent receiving Investment Grade Status (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

The Senior Facilities Agreement also contains an “information covenant” under which, among other
things, the Parent is required to deliver to the Senior Facilities Agent annual financial statements, quarterly
financial statements, an annual budget and compliance certificates. In addition, the Parent may be requested
to hold an annual presentation pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Financial Covenant_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement requires, for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility that the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio in respect of each period of twelve months ending
on any quarter date (the “Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio”) shall not be greater than 9.50:1.00 for
any quarter date ending on or about 30 March 2022 and 30 June 2022, and not greater than 9.25:1.00 for any
quarter dates ending on 30 September 2022 and thereafter, provided that this financial covenant is only to be
tested if on the last day of such period, the amount drawn loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is greater
than 40% of the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments.

The Parent is permitted (subject to certain conditions) to prevent or cure breaches of the Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio covenant by applying a “cure” amount (generally, amounts received by the
Parent in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted subordinated debt) as if consolidated EBITDA had
been increased by such amount or consolidated senior secured leverage had been reduced by such amount.
There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the Revolving Facilities. No more than
four different cure amounts may be taken into account prior to the maturity date of the Senior Facilities
Agreement and cure amounts in consecutive financial quarters are not permitted.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains a limited number of events of default (misrepresentation,
unlawfulness, invalidity, rescission and repudiation, and (for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility only) a failure to comply with the financial covenant ), subject in certain cases to agreed grace
periods and other qualifications. Additionally, the Senior Facilities Agreement has events of default
substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, subject to certain cases to agreed grace periods and
other qualifications.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

**Second Lien Facility Agreement**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement provides for a second lien term loan credit facility in the amount of
£325,000,000 (the “Second Lien Facility”). The Second Lien Facility is to be used for the refinancing and
discharge of existing indebtedness of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, to make a distribution to the
direct parent company of the Parent, to fund transaction costs and as to any remaining balance the general
corporate purposes and working capital purposes of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries.

In addition, the Parent may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional
tranches of the Second Lien Facility (the “Second Lien Incremental Facilities”). The Parent and the lenders in
respect of the Second Lien Incremental Facilities may agree to certain terms in relation to the Second Lien
Incremental Facilities, including the margin and the termination date (subject to parameters as set out in the


-----

Second Lien Facility Agreement). The indebtedness incurred under the Second Lien Incremental Facilities
must be otherwise permitted under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

**_Maturity_**

The Second Lien Facility matures on the date falling 96 months after Issue Date.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Second Lien Facility Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate to be determined and
SONIA plus a spread adjustment (if any is agreed).

The margin on any loans under a Second Lien Incremental Facilities will be agreed between the Parent
and the relevant lenders.

If SONIA (as applicable) is less than zero, SONIA (as applicable) shall be deemed to be zero in respect of
any loan under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on any overdue amount.

The Parent is also required to pay (or procure the payment of) customary agency and arrangement fees in
connection with the Second Lien Facility.

**_Repayment_**

All outstanding amounts under the Second Lien Facility are required to be repaid on the maturity date
referred to above.

The termination date in respect of a Second Lien Incremental Facilities will be the date agreed between
the Parent and the relevant lenders.

**_Prepayment_**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum amount
and certain conditions).

The Second Lien Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of
all amounts due to that lender upon a change of control of the Parent or a sale of the whole or substantially
the whole of the business and assets of the restricted group. The asset dispositions covenant in the Second
Lien Facility Agreement also requires the Parent to prepay the Second Lien Facility with the net proceeds
received from certain disposals (subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights).

Subject to certain exceptions, if the Second Lien Facility is voluntarily prepaid (or mandatorily prepaid
upon a change of control) before the date falling 24 months after the first utilization of the Second Lien
Facility, the Parent is required to pay (or procure that another member of the restricted group will pay) a
prepayment fee as set out and calculated under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

**_Guarantees_**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement is guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee the Senior
Facilities. See “—Senior Facilities Agreement—Guarantees” above.

The Second Lien Facility Agreement includes a “Guarantor Coverage Threshold” (being, subject to
certain exceptions, the requirement that the consolidated EBITDA of the Guarantors represents not less than
80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the restricted group excluding any member of the restricted group that
is not required to become a guarantor in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles). In addition, if the
Guarantor Coverage Threshold is not met when tested by reference to delivery of the annual financial
statements of the Parent for the relevant year, within 60 days each Material Company that is not already a
guarantor (together with such other members of the restricted group as necessary) shall become guarantors
under the Second Lien Facility Agreement in order to meet the Guarantor Coverage Threshold at that time.
“Material Company” is generally defined under the Second Lien Facility Agreement to include, among other
things, any member of the restricted group that is incorporated or established in a Security Jurisdiction and
that has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing more than 5% of
consolidated EBITDA of the restricted group. “Security Jurisdiction” is defined in the Agreed Security


-----

Principles as being (i) England and Wales, and (ii) any other jurisdiction in which, based upon the most recent
annual financial statements delivered under the Second Lien Facility ties Agreement, members of the restricted
group incorporated in that jurisdiction (disregarding the earnings from ordinary activities before interest,
taxation, depreciation, amortization and exceptional items (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated
EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (“Jurisdiction Entity EBITDA”) of any such member of the restricted group
that generates negative Jurisdiction Entity EBITDA) account for 15 per cent. or more of consolidated
EBITDA of the restricted group. The Agreed Security Principles provide that no member of the restricted
group incorporated or established outside of a Security Jurisdiction shall be required to provide any guarantee
or security (unless such member is a borrower of the Second Lien Facility) and no member of the restricted
group shall be required to provide any security in respect of any shares or other ownership interests held in
any member of the restricted group incorporated or established outside of a Security Jurisdiction or any
member of the restricted group which is not an obligor under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

**_Security_**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement is secured by the same security interests granted as security for the
Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.”

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement contains the same customary representations and warranties as the
Senior Facilities Agreement (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations
and warranties being repeated).

**_Covenants_**

The Second Lien Facility Agreement contains the same incurrence covenants and related definitions
(with certain adjustments) that are included in the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The Second Lien Facility Agreement also requires certain members of the restricted group to observe
certain affirmative covenants, including covenants relating to maintenance of authorizations, compliance
with laws, environmental compliance, payment of taxes, preservation of intellectual property, pari passu
ranking, funding of pensions, maintenance of insurances, further assurance with respect to security interests
granted, sanctions and anti-corruption, access upon an event of default, maintenance of Guarantor Coverage
Threshold on an annual basis (see “—Guarantees” above), as well as a limitation on speculative hedging
transactions and a customary anti-layering covenant.

Primary Creditors (and shall promptly do so on the request of and at the cost of the Parent) for the purposes
of implementing such Super Senior Designation.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Liabilities_**

The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities at any time. The Intercreditor

Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the Senior Debt Documents and the Operating Facility
Documents in accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent

The Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders may take, accept or receive the benefit
of:

(i) any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Liabilities and the

(C) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the liabilities, the
benefit of which (however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain
Agreed Security Principles, given to all the Senior Secured Creditors and the Second Lien
Secured Creditors in respect of their respective liabilities;

provided that, to the extent legally possible, and subject to certain Agreed Security Principles,

     - the guarantee provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not already
a party in that capacity); and

     - such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(iii) any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in
connection with:

discharge of any Senior Liabilities and/or Operating Facility Liabilities (in each case provided
that such defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other discharge is not
prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Secured Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that none of the Senior Secured Creditors or the Operating Facility
Lenders may take certain Enforcement Action without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group (as
defined below).

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, after
the occurrence of certain specified insolvency events (an “Insolvency Event”) in relation to the Parent or a
Debtor, each Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may, to the extent it is able to do so under
the relevant debt documents, take certain Enforcement Action and/or claim in the winding up, dissolution,
administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event of the Parent or that Debtor (as applicable) for
liabilities owing to it (but a Senior Creditor or an Operating Facility Lender may not direct the Security Agent
to enforce the common security in any manner).

_Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Financing Creditors_

Senior Notes Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities
(the “Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration event which is
continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to them (or to a
nominee or nominees), in accordance with the applicable transfer provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Facilities Liabilities and the
Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Operating Facility Documents;


-----

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Operating Facility Documents are complied with, other than:

(ii) all of the Senior Facilities Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all amounts

Senior Lenders and/or the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(d) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(i) all of the Operating Facility Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all amounts
that would have been payable under the Operating Facility Documents if the Operating
Facilities were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that payment; and

(ii) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Operating Facility Lenders and/or
the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(iii) as a result of that transfer:

Senior Finance Documents; and

(B) the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a Debtor
under the Operating Facility Documents;

(e) an indemnity is provided from each of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors (other than any
Senior Agent) or from another third-party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders and the Operating
Facility Lenders in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender and Operating Facility
Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by
any Senior Lender or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or recovered by
any Senior Lender or Operating Facility Lender from any person being required (or it being alleged
that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender or Operating Facility
Lender for any reason;

(f) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders or
the Operating Facility Lenders, except that each Senior Lender and Operating Facility Lender shall
be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate
power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the making by it of
that transfer; and

(g) the Senior Parent Creditors have not exercised their rights to purchase as described under the
provisions set out in the caption “—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors”or, having exercised
such rights, have not failed to complete the acquisition of the relevant Senior Liabilities in
accordance with such provisions.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors may only require a
transfer of the Senior Liabilities or the Operating Facility Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer
of Hedging Liabilities in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer
cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of the Senior Liabilities or the
Operating Facility Liabilities (as applicable) may be required to be made.

Facility Agent and the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify that Senior Agent of the foregoing payable
sums in connection with such transfer.

_Second Lien Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Senior Consent), no Debtor shall make (and

may receive from any other members of the Group, any Permitted Second Lien Payment (other than roll-up
or capitalization of any amount or certain amounts due to the Second Lien Agent for its own account and
subject to certain other exceptions) if:

(a) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) a Material Event of Default is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on
which the Senior Agent delivers a payment stop notice (a “Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”)
specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Material Event of Default to the Parent, the
Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Permitted Parent Financing Creditor
Representative until the earliest of:

     - the date falling (a) 90 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice if a Second
Lien Event of Default is continuing in respect of non-payment of principal, interest or fees in
respect of any Second Lien Liabilities; (b) 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice if a Second Lien Event of Default is continuing in respect of breach of certain

Permitted Second Lien Financing Document; (c) 150 days after delivery of that Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice if any other Second Lien Event of Default is continuing;

standstill period expires;

Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Second Lien Agents cancelling
the Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; and

Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent

of that Material Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event
or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the
Agents to issue a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Material Event of Default which had
been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Second Lien Debt as a result of the issue of a Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an
Event of Default (as defined in any Second Lien Debt Document) as a consequence of that failure to make a
payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien Debt Document; (ii) the issue of a Second Lien Enforcement
Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Creditors; (iii) any debt-for-equity transaction
in respect of Second Lien Liabilities; (iv) payment of advisory or professional fees in respect of restructuring
advice and/or valuations in respect of the Debtors provided to the Second Lien Secured Creditors not
exceeding in aggregate £1,500,000; or (v) payment to the Second Lien Secured Creditors of fees in respect of

those paid to the Senior Secured Creditors in respect of amendments to, and consents or waivers of, the
Senior Debt Documents, as applicable.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which
shall continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Debt Document by the operation of the provisions set out
under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Creditors and Second
_Lien Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of_
those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Debt Documents
shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Second Lien Payment Stop_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the
case may be) the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Secured Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents and which would have been
Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, a Senior Payment
Default,

then any event or circumstance specified to be an “Event of Default” in any of the Debt Financing
Agreements (an “Event of Default”) (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt
document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and any
Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be
waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien Secured
Creditors or any other creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_

relation to the Second Lien Liabilities,


-----

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement.”_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Second Lien Secured Creditors or Second Lien Agents
(on behalf of the Second Lien Secured Creditors) may, after a Senior Acceleration Event, the issue of a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice that is continuing or during a Second Lien Standstill Period that is
continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to such Second
Lien Secured Creditors of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior
Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Debt Documents pursuant to
which any Senior Liabilities remain outstanding are complied with other than as specified in the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) the relevant Senior Agents on behalf of the Senior Secured Creditors are paid the amounts required
under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) as a result of that transfer the Senior Secured Creditors have no further actual or contingent liability
to the Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant debt documents;

(e) an indemnity is provided from each Second Lien Secured Creditor (other than any Second Lien
Agent) (or from another third party acceptable to all the Senior Secured Creditors) in a form

sum received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor from any person being required (or it
being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Secured Creditor
for any reason; and

Creditors, except that each Senior Secured Creditor shall be deemed to have represented and
warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it
has taken all necessary action to authorize the making by it of that transfer.

At the request of a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured Creditors), the relevant
Senior Agent shall notify the Second Lien Agents of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such
transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured
Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer of
hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be
made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Liabilities may be required to be
made.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, any of the Second Lien Secured Creditors or a Second Lien
Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured Creditors) may, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the

same time, they require a transfer of the Senior Liabilities or all the Second Lien Secured Creditors (acting as
a whole) require a transfer of the relevant hedging liabilities at any time on or after the Senior Discharge Date
or a Second Lien Acceleration Event has occurred and is continuing or a Second Lien Standstill Period has

Liabilities (a “Second Lien Borrower/Issuer”) or any guarantor of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities
(a “Second Lien Guarantor”); provided, however, that if a Second Lien Standstill Period ends
pursuant to this paragraph, the Second Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement
Action in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or Second Lien Guarantor as the
Enforcement Action taken by the Primary Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured
Creditors) against such Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or Second Lien Guarantor and not against
any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or a
particular Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned
Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each Senior Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Senior Consent)
has been obtained; and


-----

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Debt Document at the
final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding under that Second Lien Debt Document (provided
that unless the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required
Senior Consent and the Parent, the final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date
falling 85 months after the date of first utilization under the Senior Facilities Agreement,

(the “Second Lien Standstill Period”).

_Subsequent Second Lien Default_

The Second Lien Secured Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption
“—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if, at the
end of any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period
has begun as a result of any other Second Lien Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Agents that it is enforcing security created pursuant to
any security document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Second
Lien Secured Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption
“—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above against that Second Lien Borrower/Issuer or that Second Lien
Guarantor (or any subsidiary of them) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in
accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities_**

_Restriction on Payment and Dealings_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, until the Primary Discharge Date, the Senior Parent Debt
Issuer shall not (and the Parent shall ensure that no member of the Group will):

(a) pay, repay, prepay, redeem, acquire or defease any principal, interest or other amount on or in respect
of, or make any distribution in respect of, any Senior Parent Liabilities in cash or in kind or apply
any such money or property in or towards discharge of any Senior Parent Liabilities except as
permitted by the provisions set out below under the captions “—Permitted Senior Parent Payments,”
“—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement,” and the fourth paragraph under the caption “—Effect of
_Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” or by a refinancing of the Senior Parent Liabilities as permitted_
by the Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) exercise any set-off against any Senior Parent Liabilities, except as permitted by the provisions set
out in the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Payments,” the provisions set out in the caption
“—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors” or the fourth paragraph under the
caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” or by a refinancing of the Senior Parent
Liabilities as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(c) create or permit to subsist any security over any assets of any member of the Group or give any
guarantee (and the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or Permitted Parent Financing Creditor
Representative, as the case may be, may not, and no Senior Parent Creditor may, accept the benefit
of any such security or guarantee from any member of the Group) for, or in respect of, any Senior
Parent Liabilities other than:

(i) guarantees by a member of the Group of any obligations of a member of the Group under the
Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Documents;

(ii) at the option of the Parent, all or any of the security (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
each of the parties agrees that the security shall rank and secure any Senior Parent Liabilities as
set out in “—Ranking and Priority—Priority of Security”);

(iii) any security over any assets of any Senior Parent Debt Issuer (other than, without prejudice to
paragraph (ii) above, any such assets over which a Senior Parent Debt Issuer has granted
security);


-----

(iv) any other security or guarantee provided by a member of the Group (the “Credit Support
_Provider”) provided that, to the extent legally possible:_

(A) the Credit Support Provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if
not already a party in that capacity);

(B) all amounts actually received or recovered by the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, the
Permitted Parent Financing Creditor Representative or the Senior Parent Creditors, as the
case may be, with respect to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security
Agent and applied in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption
“—Application of Proceeds;”

(C) any such security may only be enforced in accordance with the provisions set out under the
caption “—Enforcement of Security—Security Held by Other Creditors;” and

(D) such guarantee is expressed to be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(v) any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the
Group in connection with:

(A) any escrow or similar or equivalent arrangements entered into in respect of amounts which
are being held (or will be held) by a person which is not a member of the Group prior to
release of those amounts to a member of the Group; or

(B) any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other
discharge of any Senior Facilities Liabilities, Operating Facility Liabilities, Senior Notes
liabilities and any Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities (in each case provided that such
defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other discharge is not
prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

_Permitted Senior Parent Payments_

Prior to the Primary Discharge Date, any member of the Group may make payments with respect to the
Senior Parent Liabilities (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Senior Parent Payments”):

(a) if:

(i) the payment is of:

(A) any of the principal amount of the Senior Parent Liabilities which is either (1) not
prohibited from being paid by the Senior Debt Documents or (2) paid on or after the final
maturity date of the relevant Senior Parent Liabilities (subject to certain conditions); or

(B) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest;

(ii) no Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(iii) no Senior Payment Default has occurred and is continuing; and

(iv) no payment default under the Second Lien Debt Documents has occurred and is continuing
(the “Second Lien Payment Default”); or

(b) if (A) the Required Senior Consent have been obtained and (B) the Majority Second Lien Facility
Lenders and the Majority Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors or the Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt
(as applicable) (the “Required Second Lien Consent”) give prior consent to that payment being made;

(c) if the payment is of certain amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its own account;

(d) if the payment is made by the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer and funded directly or indirectly
with amounts which have not been received by that Senior Parent Debt Issuer from another member
of the Group;

(e) of any costs and expenses of any holder of security in relation to protection, preservation or
enforcement of such security;

(f) of costs, commissions, taxes, fees and expenses incurred in respect of or in relation to (or reasonably


-----

incidental to) any of the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and any Permitted Parent
Financing Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under such
documents);

(g) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with Permitted Parent Financing Debt and/or the
proceeds of any indebtedness under any Senior Parent Finance Documents;

(h) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of a Shareholder Contribution or
Subordinated Debt; or

(i) or any other amount not exceeding £5,000,000 in aggregate in any financial year of the Parent.

On or after the Primary Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments in respect of the Senior Parent
Liabilities at any time.

_Senior Parent Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Senior Consent) and the Second Lien
Discharge Date (except with the Required Second Lien Consent), no Senior Parent Debt Issuer shall make
(and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group will make), and neither the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee, any holder of Senior Parent Notes, the Security Agent or the Permitted Parent Financing
Creditors may receive from any other members of the Group, any Permitted Senior Parent Payment (other
than roll-up or capitalization of any amount or certain amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its
own account and subject to certain other exceptions) if:

(a) a Senior Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) a Senior Event of Default (other than a Senior Payment Default) or a Second Lien Event of Default
(other than a Second Lien Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day
after the date on which any Senior Agent and/or any Second Lien Agent delivers a payment stop
notice (a “Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to
that Senior Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent, the
Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Permitted Parent Financing Creditor Representative until the
earliest of:

     - the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

     - in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Liabilities, if a Senior Parent Standstill Period is in
effect at any time after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that
standstill period expires;

     - the date on which the relevant Senior Event of Default and/or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived in accordance with the applicable Senior Debt Document or Second
Lien Debt Document;

     - the date on which the Senior Agent or Second Lien Agent which delivered the relevant Senior
Parent Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the other
Agents cancelling the Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

     - the Primary Discharge Date; and

     - the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Permitted Parent
Financing Creditor Representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Permitted Parent Financing Creditor Representative
waive this requirement, (i) a new Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until
360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice; and
(ii) no Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent or a Second Lien Agent in
reliance on a Senior Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that
Senior Agent or Second Lien Agent received notice of that Senior Event of Default or Second Lien Event of
Default.

The Senior Agents and the Second Lien Agents may only serve one Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice
with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this


-----

shall not affect the right of the Senior Agents and/or the Second Lien Agents to issue a Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Event of Default or Second
Lien Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and any
Permitted Parent Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the
occurrence of a Senior Payment Default or a Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence
of an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing
Agreement, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant
Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents; or (ii) the issue of
a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Senior Parent
Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the provisions set out
under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior
_Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of_
those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Finance
Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default, that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or
(as the case may be) the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior
Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any Senior Parent
Finance Document or any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which would have been
Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Payment Default,

then any event or circumstance specified to be an “Event of Default” in any of the Debt Financing
Agreements (an “Event of Default”) (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt
document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and any
Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be
waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or
any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the Senior Parent Debt Issuer
and the Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or the
Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their terms at any time (and subject only to any
consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the Primary Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing
Group:

(a) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the
enforcement of any security; and


-----

(b) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to
the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer
under the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or Permitted Parent Financing Documents,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent
_Enforcement” provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to_
the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Parent Agents (on behalf of the Senior Parent
Creditors) may, after a Senior Acceleration Event or a Second Lien Acceleration Event, by giving not less
than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Senior Parent Creditors of all, but not
part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the
Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
relevant Senior Debt Documents (in the case of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant Second Lien
Debt Documents (in the case of the Second Lien Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility
Documents (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) (as applicable);

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the relevant Senior Debt Documents (in the
case of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant Second Lien Debt Documents (in the case of the Second
Lien Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents (in the case of the Operating Facility
Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) each of the relevant Senior Agent (on behalf of the relevant Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes
Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors), is paid the amounts required under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(e) the relevant Second Lien Agent (on behalf of the relevant Second Lien Facility Lenders and the
Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors, as applicable) is paid the amounts required under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Second Lien Facility Lenders, the Senior Notes
Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to the
Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(g) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Parent Creditor (other than any Senior Parent Agent)
(or from another third party acceptable to the relevant creditors) in a form reasonably satisfactory
to each relevant creditor in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained
or incurred by any Senior Lender, Second Lien Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted
Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender
in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any such party from any person being required
(or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender,
Second Lien Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender for any reason; and

(h) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, any Senior Lender,
Second Lien Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, except that each of them shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate
power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the making by it of
that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent
Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer of
hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be
made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Liabilities may be required to be
made.


-----

At the request of a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors), the relevant
Senior Agent, the Second Lien Agent and the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify the Senior Parent Agents
of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such transfer.

_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_

The restrictions set out in the caption “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors” above
will not apply if:

(a) a Senior Parent Event of Default (the “Relevant Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;

(b) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default specifying the event
or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent Default from the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditor Representative, as the case may be;

(c) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(d) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent Standstill
Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or
the Permitted Parent Financing Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a “Senior Parent
_Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify each Senior Agent of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of_
Default.

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period
beginning on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Parent Notes Trustee or
the Permitted Parent Financing Creditor Representative, as the case may be, serves a Senior Parent
Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Relevant Senior Parent Default and
ending on the earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Primary Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior Parent
_Guarantor”); provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to this_
paragraph, the Senior Parent Finance Parties may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation
to the Senior Parent Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Primary Secured Parties
against such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a particular
Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned
Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each Senior Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Senior Consent)
and any Second Lien Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Second Lien Consent) has been
obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding
under the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be
(provided that (i) unless the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to
a Required Senior Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a
date prior to the date falling 85 months after the after the date of first utilization of any indebtedness
under the Senior Debt Documents, and (ii) unless the Second Lien Discharge Date has occurred or
is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required Second Lien Consent and agreed by the Parent, such
final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 97 months after the date of first
utilization of any indebtedness under the Second Lien Debt Documents),

(the “Senior Parent Standstill Period”).


-----

_Subsequent Senior Parent Notes Default_

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption
“—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default even if, at the
end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Parent Standstill
Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified each Senior Parent Agent that it is enforcing security created pursuant
to any security document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor may take any
action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement”
above against that Senior Parent Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in
accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the
Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in respect of
liabilities owed to that party shall (in the case of any creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent
that such distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set
out under the caption “—Turnover by the Creditors” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if
required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able
to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay
that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full.
In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged by
way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that
member of the Group, any creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which benefited from that set-off shall
(in the case of any creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that the relevant discharge
constitutes a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Turnover by
_the Creditors” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the_
instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant
information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which
are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds,” if the Security Agent or
any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the liabilities,
the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds
are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor or, following an acceleration event
which is continuing, any member of the Group, each creditor and each Operating Facility Lender irrevocably
authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against
that member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the Group’s
liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably
requests in order to give effect to the matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims”


-----

section and (ii) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect
_of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims”section or if the Security Agent requests that a creditor or an Operating_
Facility Lender take that action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security
Agent or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably
require, although a Senior Notes Trustee, a Permitted Second Lien Notes Trustee and the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee shall be under no obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take
such action.

**_Turnover by the Creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if at any time prior to the Final
Discharge Date, any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender receives or recovers from any member of the
Group:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, (i) any of the liabilities which is
prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, or (ii) following the occurrence of the
relevant distress event which is continuing, any Senior Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Operating
Facility Liabilities;

(b) other than as referred to in the second paragraph under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event;
_Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which_
does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress event
including as a result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the Group other than
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Group; or

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a distress
event,

other than, in each case, (A) any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds;”and (B) in the case of intra-group liabilities, any amount
received or recovered in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement regulating
the intra-group lender and intra-group liabilities (to the extent permitted to be received or recovered
notwithstanding that an acceleration event is continuing);

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security in accordance with the provisions set out below in
the caption “—Application of Proceeds;” or

(e) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or
in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in accordance with
the provisions set out in the caption “—Application of Proceeds”and which is made as a result of, or
after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Group,

that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender will (in the case of any receipts and recoveries referred to in
paragraph (e) above, if a distress event has not occurred, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the
instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to certain exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries
not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant
liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount
to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
(y) subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent,
promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant
liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, subject to receiving
payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount
equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an
Instructing Group; (ii) if required as set out under the third paragraph of this section, the Majority Second
Lien Creditors; or (iii) if required as set out under the fourth paragraph of this section, the Majority Senior
Parent Creditors.


-----

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an Instructing Group;
(ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the Senior
Discharge Date as described under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Creditors and Second
_Lien Liabilities” above, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or (iii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to_
require the enforcement of the security prior to the Senior Discharge Date as described under the caption
“—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” above, the Majority Senior
Parent Creditors, may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain
from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to
enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and,
in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security
Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors
are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to
_Second Lien Creditors and Second Lien Liabilities” above._

Prior to the Primary Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to
enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and,
in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security
Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Senior Parent Creditors
are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to
_Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” above._

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no Secured Party shall have any independent
power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under
the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions,” the
Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator, examiner or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

  - an Instructing Group;

   - prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph
under the caption “—Enforcement of Security”above, given effect to instructions given by the Majority
Second Lien Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions
as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; or

   - prior to the Primary Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the fourth paragraph
under the caption “—Enforcement of Security”above, given effect to instructions given by the Majority
Senior Parent Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions
as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors,

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (it being understood
that, absent such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action).

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than any Senior Notes Trustee,
Permitted Second Lien Notes Trustee or Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each Operating Facility Lender
agrees with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the
supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or
rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent.
The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing
Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other creditor or Operating
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive,
reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that
creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that


-----

the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received
or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other security
interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so
applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security Agent, then that
Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in accordance with instructions given by
an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references
to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor or Operating Facility Lender).

_Consultation Period_

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other Enforcement Action, the
creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented in the Instructing Group
concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each other
creditor representative of the Creditors of the Instructing Group, each other Hedge Counterparty,
each Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be
given by the Instructing Group for a period of not less than 10 business days (or, in the case of any
consultation involving a Senior Notes Trustee, a Senior Parent Notes Trustee or a creditor
representative in respect of any high-yield notes, debt securities or other similar instruments, 30 days)
from the date on which details of the proposed instructions are received by such creditor
representative(s), Hedge Counterparties, Operating Facility Lenders and the Security Agent (or such
shorter period as each creditor representative, Hedge Counterparty, Operating Facility Lender and
the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a
Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or take any other
Enforcement Action.

(b) No Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph (a) above
and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce
the security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period (in each
case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the creditors represented in the
Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor representative, the
Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby
delay the commencement of enforcement of the security would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security, and, where this paragraph
(d) applies:

(I) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests
of the Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is
acting in relation to the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

(II) the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges
that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the Primary
Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to any Senior Parent
Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management
or realization of any of that security shall be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the
Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law.


-----

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(a) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the subject
of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes
Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement,
any Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any
Permitted Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing Agreement”) (including a
disposal to a member of the Group, but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of
the Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide replacement security); or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement pursuant
to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(b) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or agreement
in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that
document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any
action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the
terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

(c) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member of
the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor or will cease to be a Debtor simultaneously with such
release; and

(d) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the extent
that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of
any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor)
will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor (including in connection with the resignation of that
Debtor or the Debtor being designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the Security Agent (on behalf of itself
and the Secured Parties) shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release
(or procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the
Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the security and
the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals”section, the Parent
shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(a) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal or
other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(b) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in
accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements;

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without the
need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility
Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into such documentation and/or take such other
action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release or other matter described in
the paragraph above.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction
of any Senior Liabilities then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other
party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents or Permitted Parent Financing
Documents and any such application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in


-----

prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph
is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other
transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to
the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at the
cost of the Parent):

(i) release the security; and

(ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities,
undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being
effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become
enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by
enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or
(c) being disposed of to a third-party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or
Debtor):

(a) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release:

(i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities,
its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor, to release:

(i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides
to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:


-----

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a
Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or
Debtor liabilities; provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document,
the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of
the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of:

(A) all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders; and

(B) all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any
part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter
into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor
of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those
intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving
Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities
are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of constituted secured
assets) as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the
extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent (acting in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair
market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to
postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in relation to a member of the
Group would otherwise be released pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or,
as the case may be, other liabilities transferred to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other
Secured Party or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at the
request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the consent of
each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the
proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant
to a “public auction”in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or, in circumstances
where the Security Agent (acting in good faith) considers that a public auction is not reasonably practicable
taking into account all relevant circumstances or following an attempted public auction the Primary Creditors


-----

(other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors and the Senior Parent Creditors) make the highest final binding
offer of all the offers received but that offer is less than the aggregate par value of the Primary Liabilities
(other than the Second Lien Liabilities and the Senior Parent Liabilities), an independent financial adviser
has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith
is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in
respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select
or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally,
any Second Lien Liabilities will be release or disposed of or any security securing the Second Lien Liabilities
will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

   - each Second Lien Agent has approved the release; or

   - where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities are
sold:

(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(b) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance
bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose
shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) or assets are sold or
disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or
sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its
affiliates), and all security interests under the security documents in respect of the shares or assets
that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale; provided that, if each of the Senior Facility Agent, any Senior Notes
Trustee and any Permitted Senior Financing Creditor Representative (acting reasonably and in good
faith):

(i) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if such claim is sold
or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged;
and

(ii) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its
affiliates; and

(c) such sale or disposal is made:

(i) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to
participate; or

(ii) in circumstances where the Security Agent (acting in good faith) considers that a public auction

attempted public auction the Primary Creditors (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors
and the Senior Parent Creditors) make the highest final binding offer of all the offers received
but that offer is less than the aggregate par value of the Primary Liabilities (other than the
Second Lien Liabilities and the Senior Parent Liabilities), an independent financial adviser has
delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal, that the amount received in connection
therewith, generally, is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such
financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it
being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any
financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/ or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

If prior to the Senior Parent Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally,
the guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any
security over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be released and/or


-----

the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities will be released or disposed
of, it is a further condition to the release that either:

  - the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Permitted Parent Financing Creditor Representative has
approved the release; or

   - where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer are sold:

(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(b) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation
to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if
any), all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) or
assets are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released
and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the

of the shares or assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released
and discharged concurrently with such sale; provided that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably
and in good faith):

(i) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if such claim is sold
or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged;
and

(ii) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its
affiliates; and

(c) such sale or disposal is made:

(i) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to

-----

Operating Facility Lenders in the proportions which their respective exposures at the enforcement
date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders at the relevant enforcement date (or, in the case of Recoveries resulting from the
realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security interests or a transaction in lieu thereof,
in a manner reflecting the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned “—Application of
_Proceeds—Order of Application”), the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility_
Lenders will make such payments among themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the
relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may
be, to otherwise reflect the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned “—Application of
_Proceeds—Order of Application”); and_

(b) if, for any reason, any Second Lien Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and

a transaction in lieu thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of priority contemplated in the section
captioned “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”), the relevant Second Lien Facility
Lenders and the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors will make such payments among
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant Second Lien Facility Lenders and
the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors in such a position that (after taking into account
such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may be, to otherwise
reflect the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned “—Application of Proceeds—
_Order of Application”)._

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Parent and the Security
Agent without the consent of any other party, to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities or
inconsistencies or reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative nature, or as otherwise for the benefit
of all or any of the Secured Parties.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement and unless
the provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent may, if authorized by an
Instructing Group, and if the Parent consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “—Exceptions,” any amendment or

charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the security are distributed requires
approval as set out under the section captioned “—Required Consents.”

**_Exceptions_**

   - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption
“—Proceeds of Disposals” above.

The first paragraph of this “—Exceptions” section shall apply to an arranger only to the extent that the
arranger liabilities are then owed to that arranger.


-----

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides
anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

**_Guarantees_**

The Intercreditor Agreement additionally provides for Hedge Counterparties and Operating Facility
Lenders (each as defined above) to receive guarantees and indemnities from the Debtors on substantially the
same terms (including the relevant limitations) as such guarantees and indemnities are provided by the obligors
to the finance parties under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**Receivables Facility Agreement**

Funding for BCA Partner Finance is provided, among other sources, by a £220 million non-recourse
receivables facility (the “Receivables Facility”), which is governed by a receivables facility agreement dated
February 1, 2018, as amended and restated from time to time, among, inter alios, BCA Vehicle Finance
Limited, HSBC Invoice Finance (UK) Limited, RBS Invoice Finance Limited, Santander UK plc and Royal
Bank of Canada (the “Receivables Facility Agreement”). The Receivables Facility may be used for general
corporate and/or working capital purposes of the BCA Partner Finance business. The Receivables Facility
operates by way of the sale and purchase of certain debts by BCA Vehicle Finance Limited (and upon
accession, certain other subsidiaries of BCA Vehicle Finance Limited) to the receivables trustee under the
Receivables Facility Agreement, whereby approximately 70% of vehicle sale price is funded through the
Receivables Facility, with the remainder being funded from cash on our balance sheet. Borrowings under the
Receivables Facility are secured by an English law debenture providing fixed and floating security interests
over certain assets of BCA Vehicle Finance Limited. The Receivables Facility Agreement includes a guarantee
and contains limited operating conditions, which will require us to not exceed certain debt levels and customers
not to exceed certain debt turn periods, failing which the lenders under the Receivables Facility Agreement
have various rights including the option to demand a higher interest payable on the borrowings under the
Receivables Facility. The terms of the Receivables Facility Agreement also require us to ensure that we meet
80% of Vehicle Finance Limited’s budgeted EBITDA, which we are required to report to the lenders on a
quarterly basis. For the purposes of the Indenture, borrowings under the Receivables Facility do not constitute
Indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.”


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of £650.0 million aggregate principal amount of % senior secured notes due
2027 (the “Notes”).

The Notes will be issued by Constellation Automotive Financing plc (the “Issuer”), a public limited company
which has been organized as a special purpose finance subsidiary under the laws of England and Wales to
facilitate the offering of debt securities and which has no operations and no assets other than its rights under
the on-loans of proceeds pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreements (as defined herein). The Issuer is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Automotive Group Limited (the “Parent”) and will be dependent
on payments by Constellation Automotive Limited (“CAL”) on the borrowings under the Proceeds Loan
Agreements in order to service the Notes.

The Notes will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent, CAL, BCA Central Limited (“BCA Central”)
and, together with the Parent, the “Initial Guarantors”) and, on or following the Issue Date, be unconditionally
guaranteed by certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent (the “Additional Guarantors” and
together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). Unless the context otherwise requires, in this
“Description of the Notes,” the “Parent” refers only to Constellation Automotive Group Limited, the direct
parent of the Issuer, and any successor obligor to Constellation Automotive Group Limited, and not to any
of its subsidiaries, including the Issuer; and the “Issuer” refers only to Constellation Automotive Financing
plc, and any successor obligor to Constellation Automotive Financing plc.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date among
the Issuer, the Initial Guarantors and GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will
be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. For
further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the
Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions
by reference to or otherwise be subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees (as defined herein) will be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and any additional intercreditor agreements entered into in the future. The terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understand the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral
(as defined herein) securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees. See “Description of Other Financial
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Indenture, the
Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Proceeds Loan Agreements. Since this description of the terms of the
Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Indenture for complete descriptions of the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors and your rights.

Copies of the Indenture, the form of Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Intercreditor Agreement are
available as set forth under “Where to Find Additional Information.”

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but the offering is limited to £650.0 million
aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (the “Offering”). We may issue an unlimited principal
amount of Additional Notes (as defined herein) under the Indenture subject to the procedures described
therein; provided that we will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants
contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). See also the section of this Offering
Memorandum entitled “—Additional Notes.” Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of
_the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes and the Additional Notes that are actually issued._

**Summary Description of the Notes**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be:

- senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s
existing or future obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the
Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Second Lien Facility and certain hedging obligations, if
any;


-----

- secured by the Collateral as set forth below under “—Security—The Collateral,” along with borrowings
under the Senior Facilities, the Second Lien Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any;

- senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes and any Note Guarantee;

- effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the Issuer to the
extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes;

- effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property or
assets securing such indebtedness; and

- unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue £650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes
will mature on, 2027. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the
payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum computed against the principal outstanding
on the Notes. Interest on the Notes will be payable in cash, semi-annually in arrear on and
of each year, commencing on, 2021 to holders of record on the immediately preceding
Business Day. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or,
if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period shall end on (but not include)
the relevant interest payment date.

If the interest payment date in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Parent’s compliance with the covenant described under the heading
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Notes (the
“Additional Notes”), which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except in respect of any of the
following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and,
if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates,
the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest
shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest
will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;


-----

(7) if other than denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes shall mature.

Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,”
references to the “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes to be issued on the Issue Date as
well as any Additional Notes. Such Additional Notes shall be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single
class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are
not specifically distinguished for such series. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes,
Additional Notes shall be deemed to form one series with any Notes previously issued if they have terms
substantially identical in all material respects to such other Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes sold
pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with any Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other
securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued
Notes. Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may at the option of the Issuer be
issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes
belonging to the same series previously issued without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Consequences”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S, you should_
consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of
Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined under “—Additional Amounts”), if
any, on the Global Notes (as defined under “—Transfer and Exchange”) will be payable at the specified office
or agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined under “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for
_the Notes”); provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes_
registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained_
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by wire transfer to the
Person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent,
_Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes.”_

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes for so long as the
Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will be GLAS Trust Company LLC.

The Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and (ii) a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be GLAS Trust Company LLC.
The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from
time to time, if any, and the Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent (as applicable) will make payments on and
facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Transfer Agent shall perform
the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange (the “Exchange”), and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will
notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest coupons,
as follows:


-----

- Each series of the Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

- The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common depositary and registered in
the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

- Each series of the Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons and are outside the United States in
offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one
or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes”
and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).

- The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants_
in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures
and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and
their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form
of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the date of the initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in
Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or
Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S.
persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a
Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyers within the meaning of
Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become
a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such
transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to BookEntry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued,
without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry
Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that
hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such
Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any)
representing Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S_
_may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes,”“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—_
_Transfers”and “—Additional Notes.”_

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture.


-----

It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise
determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent or the Issuer to be in compliance with
applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized
below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in aggregate principal
amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange,
the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in
connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to
such Notes;

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer (as defined under “—Change of Control”) or an Asset Disposition Offer (as defined under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”); or

(5) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a record date and the next succeeding interest
payment date.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be entitled to treat the
Holder as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all the Parent’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries, except for Constellation
Developments Limited (formerly Cinch New Holdco Limited) and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries from
time to time, including BBD Rock Limited, Rockingham (RT) Limited and Rockingham (GW) Limited. In
the circumstances described below under the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Parent will be
permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not
be subject to any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture.

**Note Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation
resulting from a Change of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly
and severally on a senior secured basis (each, a “Note Guarantee”), by the Initial Guarantors. The Initial
Guarantors will be the Parent, CAL and BCA Central. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, it is intended
that, within two business days of the Issue Date, a Note Guarantee will be provided by BCA Marketplace
Limited, H.I.J. Limited, BCA Osprey I Limited, BCA Osprey II Limited, BCA Remarketing Group Limited,
Pennine Metals B Limited, We Buy Any Car Limited, BCA Trading Limited and British Car Auctions
Limited, and each will become an Additional Guarantor.

Each entity that provides a guarantee of the Notes (a “Subsidiary Guarantee”) other than the Parent is referred
to herein as a “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the Parent as the “Guarantors.” The Subsidiary
Guarantors consist of CAL, BCA Central, BCA Marketplace Limited, H.I.J. Limited, BCA Osprey I Limited,
BCA Osprey II Limited, BCA Remarketing Group Limited, Pennine Metals B Limited, We Buy Any Car
Limited, BCA Trading Limited and British Car Auctions Limited and will include each entity that has
guaranteed the Senior Facilities Agreement or the Second Lien Facility Agreement as of the Issue Date.


-----

In addition, after the Issue Date, in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral,” under certain circumstances the Parent will cause a Restricted_
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to become a Guarantor. The new Guarantor will also, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, be required to pledge assets in favor of the Subsidiary Guarantee as described
under “—Security.”

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under
the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security
Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be
restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security
Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect
to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Guarantee is subject_
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Note Guarantee provided by the Parent (together with the Subsidiary Guarantees, the “Guarantees”) and
the Subsidiary Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation
or merger) of Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor or of a Holding Company thereof, such that such
Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case in a
transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the
relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance”and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(4) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only (other than a Subsidiary Guarantee issued on the Issue Date),
to the extent that the relevant Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees and
_Collateral,” upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge of Indebtedness referred to in such_
paragraph;

(5) in the case of any Note Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the
provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown;”

(6) upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the
Notes; or

(7) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured
Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders
(if any) of those Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries
over the claims of creditors of the Parent, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore
will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of any future Subsidiaries of the Parent that do not become Guarantors.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, subject to the release of security in respect of the Existing Facilities, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted


-----

Collateral Liens and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be secured on a
first-priority basis by an English law governed debenture granted by the Initial Guarantors, including securing
the Parent Guarantor’s shares in the capital of CAL (the “Initial Collateral”).

Within two business days from the Issue Date and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the operation of
the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens and certain
material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by:

   - an English law governed debenture granted by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, CAL, BCA Central,
BCA Marketplace Limited, BCA Osprey I Limited, BCA Osprey II Limited, BCA Remarketing Group
Limited, Pennine Metals B Limited, We Buy Any Car Limited, BCA Trading Limited and British Car
Auctions Limited;

   - a Jersey law governed security interest agreement granted by BCA Marketplace Limited in respect of
the shares of H.I.J. Limited;

   - a Jersey law governed security interest agreement granted by H.I.J. Limited in respect of material bank
accounts and material intercompany receivables; and

   - an English law governed share pledge granted by H.I.J. Limited in respect of the shares of BCA Osprey
I Limited, (the “Post-Closing Collateral” and together with the Initial Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain guarantees may not be granted, certain assets may not be secured or
such security may not be perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:

- if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders and the other
secured parties;

- if providing such security requires consent of a third party and, if the asset is material, such consent cannot
be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

- if providing such security would be prohibited by applicable law, general statutory limitations, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization”rules or similar matters or entering
into the Security Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors, contravene any legal or
regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors or officers;

- if the granting of security or perfecting such security would have a material adverse effect on the ability of
such Subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture; and

- in the case of bank accounts, notices to the banks with whom the accounts are maintained will only be
served if required by local laws to perfect the relevant security.

**_Administration and Enforcement of Security_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by a Security Agent (or in certain
circumstances a receiver or delegate) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all the secured
parties. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Financial Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The ability of Holders to realize the Collateral will be subject to various insolvency law limitations in the event
of the Parent’s insolvency and various contractual limitations set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—English
_and Jersey insolvency laws may provide you with less protection than bankruptcy laws of other jurisdictions you_
_are familiar with” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the_
_Guarantees—Each Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Security Documents will provide that the rights of the Holders with respect to the Collateral must be
exercised by the Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may
not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security
Documents. The Holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security
Agent will agree to release a security interest created by the Security Documents at the direction of the Trustee
that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of
the Holders. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Holders will, in


-----

certain circumstances, share in the ability to direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence
enforcement action under the Security Documents. See “Description of Other Financial Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer, TopCo and the Guarantors will have the right to
remain in possession and retain control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the
Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income
therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Parent in connection with
the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would
be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a
pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time
or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the
_Guarantees—The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will_
_be granted as security for the Notes, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the_
_Notes.”_

The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Trustee
for the Notes have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited, as Security Agent, in each case
to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which
the security agent is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which
the Security Agent is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and
(ii) execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter
into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the terms of the Security Documents themselves may provide for assets to cease to become
subject to security in certain circumstances without the need for a formal release (such as the sale of assets
which are subject to a charge) or the exclusion of certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be
subject to security (such as, for example, assets that may not be validly pledged or assets that are subject to a
Permitted Lien).

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent shall release, and the Trustee shall release and if so requested direct the Security Agent to
release, without the need for consent of the Holders, Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes issued under the
Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof;

(2) upon release of a Note Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such Note Guarantee granted by
such Guarantor);

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person; provided that if the Collateral is disposed
to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the relevant Collateral becomes immediately subject to a
substantially equivalent Lien in favor of the Security Agent securing the Notes (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent”);
_provided, further, that, in each case, such disposition is permitted by the Indenture;_

(4) if the Parent designates any Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(5) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured
Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or otherwise in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement;


-----

(6) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest;”_

(7) in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture; and

(8) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.”

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any other
action on the part of the Trustee.

**IPO Pushdown**

(a) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Parent shall be entitled to require (by
written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from
the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis that:
(i) references to the Parent and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to
the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall
remain the same entity and the shares of the Issuer shall be subject to a Lien in favor of the “Secured
_Parties” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement),_
that is substantially equivalent to the pledge of the shares of the Issuer entered into in or about the
Issue Date; (ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any
Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at
the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Parent” shall be deemed to be a
reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires
otherwise); and provided that nothing in this paragraph (a), including the deeming construct
contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to
it being deemed to be the Parent, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of
Default; (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default
in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is Subsidiary
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating
to any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or
otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any
covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each Holding
Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and any security granted by any such Holding Company (subject to sub-clause
(i) above); and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Parent: (A) each person which is party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” or an “Intra_Group Lender” (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor_
Agreement) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Parent
that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, and shall have no further
rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be); and (B) there shall be no obligation or
requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be; and (viii) in the
event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be,
as a consequence of this paragraph (a), any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any Person
be an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, or that any liabilities or obligations to
such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. An IPO Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a


-----

Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of
Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
provision).

(b) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture
or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents
required by the Parent in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent in order
to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above (the “IPO
_Pushdown”); provided that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not_
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, does not affect the
rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee under such amendment
replacement or other document or instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each
irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to
execute any such amended or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the
Holders (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Parent).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Parent notified to the Trustee by the Parent in writing as the Person to be treated
as the IPO Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided that: (i) the IPO Entity shall be a
Restricted Subsidiary which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO
Event (or a Holding Company of such member of the Group); (ii) the Issuer shall become a
Restricted Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity; and (iii) the Parent may not designate as the
IPO Pushdown Entity any entity which is not a direct or indirect Holding Company of Restricted
Subsidiaries constituting all or substantially all of the Group’s tangible assets.

(d) If the Parent delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) above in relation
to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior
to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any
Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of subparagraphs (a)(i) to (a)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any
security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if
required by the Trustee by prior written notice to the Parent and subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable
execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any Person party to
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or IntraGroup Lender, as the case may be, has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to
sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by
prior written notice to the Parent and that Person, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor
or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (d) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Parent
from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and
(B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default
(whether by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or
committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer, the Parent, TopCo, CAL, the Security Agent and the other parties
thereto shall enter into the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied, first, pro rata in
repayment of all obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement and any
other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be Incurred and secured by the Collateral
pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on a pari passu basis with the Notes and the
borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement and, second, in repayment of all obligations under the
Second Lien Facility Agreement and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be
Incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on a
_pari passu basis with borrowings under the Second Lien Facility Agreement._


-----

**_Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Parent, in connection with the Incurrence or refinancing
by the Issuer, the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured
on the Collateral, the Issuer, the Parent, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security
Agent, as applicable, shall enter into an intercreditor or similar agreement or a restatement, amendment or
other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) with
the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) on substantially the same terms as
the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Parent are not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the
same terms with respect to the application of the proceeds of the collateral held thereunder and the means of
enforcement, it being understood that an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subject to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not be deemed to be less favorable to
the Holders and will be permitted by this covenant if the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and any Lien in its
favor is permitted by the “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens” covenants; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any_
personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein,
the term “Intercreditor Agreement” shall include references to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that
supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement entered into on the Issue Date.

The Indenture will provide that, at the written direction of the Parent and without the consent of the Holders,
the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to:
(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or
types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer that is subject to any
such agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture); (iii) add
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional
Notes Incurred in compliance with the Indenture); (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the
Collateral to secure Additional Notes Incurred in compliance with the Indenture or to implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens; (vi) effect the IPO Pushdown; or (vii) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Parent shall not otherwise
direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor
Agreement, and the Parent may only direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee,
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture relating to the
Notes or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into
in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any
one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement as contemplated above.

**The Proceeds Loan**

After completion of the Offering, the Issuer, as lender, and CAL, as borrower, will enter into one or more
proceeds loan agreements pursuant to which the Issuer will loan to CAL the gross proceeds from the Offering
(the “Proceeds Loan Agreements”).

These proceeds loan agreements will be in pound sterling in aggregate principal amount equal to the gross
proceeds of the Notes. The proceeds loans will bear interest at a rate sufficient to pay the interest expense on
the Notes. Interest on the proceeds loans will be semi-annually in arrear on or prior to the corresponding date
for the payment of interest on the Notes.

The proceeds loan agreements will provide that CAL will pay the Issuer interest and principal due and payable
on the Notes and any Additional Amounts due thereunder. All amounts payable under the proceeds loans
will be payable to such account or accounts with such Person or Persons as the Issuer may designate. The
maturity date of the proceeds loans will be the same as the maturity date of the Notes. Except as otherwise
required by law, all payments under the proceeds loan agreements will be made without deductions or
withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that CAL is required to make any such


-----

deduction or withholding, CAL shall gross up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives
and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been made.

The proceeds loans will provide that CAL will make all payments pursuant thereto on a timely basis in order
to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, taking into
account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on
the Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” and “—Change of Control,” the
Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2023, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in
part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to the
applicable percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2023, the Issuer may redeem the Notes (i) with the
Net Cash Proceeds received by the Parent from any Equity Offering, upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to % in an aggregate principal amount for all such
redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes), plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date; provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 120 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (not including the principal
amount of any Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

At any time prior to, 2023, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option,
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time prior to, 2023, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes) during
each 12-month period commencing from the Issue Date, from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of such Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes of a series, it will, if and for so long as the Notes are
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require,
inform the Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
of that series that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

Any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such
Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions


-----

precedent, the notice of redemption may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been
delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered
at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes
will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to
the Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select the
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on
which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Paying Agent and the Registrar by the Issuer, and in compliance
with the requirements of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed, or such exchange
prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear and/or Clearstream or
Euroclear and/or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis or by use of a poolfactor; provided, however, that no Note of £100,000 or less in aggregate principal amount shall be redeemed in
part. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar shall be liable for selections made by it under this
paragraph.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuer shall notify the Exchange of such redemption and, in addition to such
publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, email such notice to Holders
at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar; provided that, for so
long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, notices of redemption to Holders will be delivered to
Euroclear and Clearstream (and such delivery will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph),
each of which shall give notices to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note,
an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including
any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.
On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for
redemption, unless the redemption price is not paid on the redemption date.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Company (as defined herein) may redeem, and a Guarantor may cause the Issuer or
Successor Company to redeem, the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date)
and all Additional Amounts (see “—Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which will become due on the
Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines that as a
result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Additional Amounts”) affecting
taxation; or


-----

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including pursuant to a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published practice) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes
or any Note Guarantee would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts or increased Additional Amounts,
and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, Successor
Company or Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent
where this would be reasonable and, in the case of a payment by a Guarantor, having the Issuer or another
Guarantor make the payment, but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect
to the Notes). In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction
that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date on which the applicable Notes are issued, such Change in Tax
Law must become effective on or after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued. In the case of
redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued, such Change in Tax Law must
become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or, in the case of
a Successor Company, on or after the date of assumption by the Successor Company of the Issuer’s
obligations hereunder). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the
procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of
redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged
to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation
to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor will deliver
to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth
a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and
that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures
available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the
Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or a Successor Company under or with respect to the Notes,
or any Guarantor (each of the Issuer, Successor Company and Guarantor, a “Payor”) with respect to any
Note Guarantee, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of,
any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having
power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Issuer, Successor Company, Guarantor or their agents, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee, including
payments of principal, purchase or redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together
with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that
the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after
such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts),
will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such
Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection


-----

between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the
relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, being a citizen or
resident or national or domiciliary of, or the existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a
dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management present or deemed present in the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or Note Guarantee, the enforcement of rights under a Note or Note
Guarantee or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or the beneficial
owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification,
identification, information or other reporting requirement relating to such matters, required by applicable
law, regulation, treaty or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from or reduction in the rate of all or part of such Tax; provided in each case the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed in connection with
Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (“FATCA”), any
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction implementing or
relating to FATCA or any non-U.S. law, regulation or guidance enacted or issued with respect thereto;

(6) any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first
made available for payment to the Holder (except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that
would have been imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day period);

(7) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or any
Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or
settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such
payment or Note would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note; or

(8) any combination of the above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course
by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and if so obtained by the
Payor will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. If so obtained, such copies shall be made available to
the Holders upon request. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount
of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the
principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per £1,000
principal amount of the Notes.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any
payment made on any Note or Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor
will deliver to the Trustee and Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts
will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent
to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises, or the Payor becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment
date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date
that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such
Officer’s Certificate without further inquiry, as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.


-----

Wherever in the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in
any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or Note Guarantees,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to
the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or
similar Taxes that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any
Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Proceeds Loan Agreements, the Security Documents or any
other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer or exchange of the Notes) excluding
any such Taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.

The foregoing obligations of this “Additional Amounts” section will survive any termination, defeasance or
discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the
Issuer or any Guarantor is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the
Issuer to repurchase all (equal to £100,000 aggregate principal amount, and integral multiples of £1,000 in
excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of
the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “Change of_
_Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of_
the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption”or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the
date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”)
to each Holder of any such Notes, by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is sent) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is emailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;


-----

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly wire to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or
an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated)
and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new
Definitive Registered Note equal in an aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least
£100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the Change of Control Payment
will be no earlier than 30 days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is emailed.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of
the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture
will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes
in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require
the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third
party from seeking to acquire the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of
Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding Notes
validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party
making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the applicable
series of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have
the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following
such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the applicable
series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to,
but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In
determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of
then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer for all
of the Notes of the applicable series, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds
controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.


-----

A Change of Control will result in a right to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Senior
Facilities and the Second Lien Facility. Future debt of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer, may
prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of
Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the
Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a
repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the
purchase on the Parent or the Issuer.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by the Issuer’s and the Parent’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—We may not be_
_able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.”_

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to
obtain control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any
obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons.

Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
_substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change_
of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority
in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary may
Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including
pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements
are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have
been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a
maximum aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness then outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of
£250 million and 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) £800 million plus, the Accordion Amount,
plus (iii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premia and other costs and expenses
Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed
is permitted under the terms of the Indenture (other than pursuant to this clause (2)); provided that,
if Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Note
Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or the Note
Guarantees, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by


-----

reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted
under the terms of the Indenture;

Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or outstanding on the Issue Date after giving
effect to the Refinancing Transactions;

(b) any Indebtedness Incurred under the Second Lien Facility Agreement not exceeding £325.0 million;

(c) any Notes (other than any Additional Notes);

(5) Indebtedness (i) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a

Subsidiary, or (ii) Incurred to provide or refinance all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate
a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted Subsidiary
or was otherwise acquired by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise in connection with or
contemplation of such acquisition; provided, however, with respect to sub-clauses (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that at
the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
have been permitted to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant after giving pro forma effect to the relevant acquisition and Incurrence of such Indebtedness
pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would not be
lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any
Person owning such assets, and (C) any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect of subclauses (A) or (B), in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the

not exceed the greater of £76.0 million and 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees or

Incurred in the ordinary course of business or for governmental or regulatory requirements, (b) letters of
credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to

in the ordinary course of business, and (d) any credit management, cash management, cash pooling, net
balance transfer, netting, setting off or similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business of the

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect thereof and the aggregate principal amount of all
other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of
£114.0 million and 45.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(12) Indebtedness (including any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect thereof) in an aggregate
outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (12) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the

Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash
Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness

the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;

outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred on such date in reliance on the
exception provided in clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant, Indebtedness under the
Senior Facilities Agreement Incurred or outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been
Incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and may not be reclassified, Indebtedness under the Second Lien Facility Agreement Incurred
or outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred on such date in reliance on the
exception provided in clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant and Guarantees of, or
obligations in respect of, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to,
or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount
of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(ii) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (7) or

credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(iv) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(v) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA”, (x) pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most
recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on
which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent
four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date for which such internal consolidated financial
statements of the Parent are available;

(vi) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(vii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as described under the
definition of “Indebtedness;” and

(viii) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of an Applicable Test Date,
if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if
calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such
refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded
so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change in IFRS
itself or a change from IFRS to a different set of accounting principles, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence
of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence
of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Applicable
Test Date; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in
a currency other than pound sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable pound sterlingdenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date of such refinancing, such pound sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premium
(including tender premium), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection
therewith; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding
on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date;
and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the
currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness,
the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in pound sterling, will be the amount of the principal
payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of
such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not
covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the preceding paragraph, the principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under
this sub-clause (iv), was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments
referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c);

Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the preceding sub-clause (i) to the extent that it

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding paragraph shall be the
fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent.
The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) any Restricted Payment made in exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the exercise of a

concurrent sale of Preferred Stock of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that, in
each case, is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” and that in each case, constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness;_

(4) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated
Indebtedness:

(a) from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted by the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” but only if the Parent shall have first complied with the terms_
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and
purchased all Notes validly tendered pursuant to any offer to repurchase all the Notes required
thereby, prior to purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring

Parent from such Public Offering or contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through an Excluded Contribution) of the Parent
or loaned or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the Parent, and (b) following the
Initial Public Offering, an amount equal to 6% of the Market Capitalization;

of an Investment or the repayment, redemption or repurchase of Subordinated Indebtedness,
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment

-----

a Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary and such Person subsequently becomes or is subsequently
designated a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, such Investment shall
thereafter be deemed to have been made pursuant to paragraphs (1) or (2) of the definition of “Permitted
_Investment” and not this clause (11);_

(12) payments by the Parent, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any Holding Company to make
payments, to holders of Capital Stock of the Parent or any Holding Company in lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares of such Capital Stock; provided, however, that any such payment, loan, advance, dividend
or distribution shall not be for the purpose of evading any limitation of this covenant or otherwise to
facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the holders of such Capital Stock (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

(13) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the fair market value
of Excluded Contributions, or consisting of non-cash Excluded Contributions, or Investments to the
extent made in exchange for or using as consideration Investments previously made under this clause (13);

(14) (i) the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of any class or series of Designated Preference
Shares of the Parent issued after the Issue Date; and (ii) the declaration and payment of dividends to any
Holding Company or any Affiliate thereof, the proceeds of which will be used to fund the payment of
dividends to holders of any class or series of Designated Preference Shares of such Holding Company or
Affiliate issued after the Issue Date; provided, however, that, in the case of sub-clauses (i) and (ii), the
amount of all dividends declared or paid pursuant to this clause (14) shall not exceed the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the Parent or the aggregate amount contributed in cash to the equity (other than
through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or an Excluded Contribution or, in the case of Designated
Preference Shares by a Holding Company or an Affiliate the issuance of Designated Preference Shares)
of the Parent or loaned or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the Parent, from the
issuance or sale of such Designated Preference Shares;

(15) dividends or other distributions of Capital Stock, Indebtedness or other securities of Unrestricted
Subsidiaries; and

(16) payment of any Receivables Fees and purchases of Receivables Assets pursuant to a Receivables
Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Parent or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. Any amounts that
would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to
sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be excluded to the extent
(1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities
received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of
Control pursuant to the definition thereof were it not a Specified Change of Control Event, (2) the purpose
of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities was to
reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries so that there would
be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without the
receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control
Offer is made in connection with such event in accordance with the requirements of the indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or
suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary),
whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits
therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of
any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes (or a Note Guarantee in
the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with
respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured and (b) in the case of any property or assets that constitute Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial
Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”


-----

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of
such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of
such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increase in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Parent
or the Issuer or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Parent or the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Parent or the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent or the Issuer,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including
the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to
constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (or any guarantee or security granted
in connection therewith), including the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility
Agreement, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Proceeds Loan Agreements, (c) the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or (d) any
other agreement or instrument in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including, in each case, any
amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect
to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements referred to in
sub-clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, as applicable (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
or an Officer of the Parent);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other
than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Parent or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection
with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement


-----

or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent) or that the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Parent’s ability to
make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset
that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease,
license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture
or securing Indebtedness of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to
the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to
such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that
imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements, and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with industry practices;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order (including encumbrances or restrictions on making distributions in cash or Cash
Equivalents as a dividend or otherwise that arise or exist by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order) or encumbrances or restrictions required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, suppliers
or landlords under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders
than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture, together with the Security
Documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent) and where, in the case of
clause (ii), the Parent determines at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted by the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Liens;” or

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:


-----

(1) the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition
(excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,
any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments.

Within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may
apply an amount equal to such Net Available Cash at the option of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) (1) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Secured Indebtedness (including Senior Secured
Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) and (14) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof); provided
that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness
pursuant to this sub-clause (1) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness, including but not
limited to the Revolving Credit Facility), the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment to be permanently reduced in an amount equal
to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; provided, further, that in the
case of the prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Senior Secured Indebtedness other
than the Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem the Notes on a
pro rata basis with such other Senior Secured Indebtedness; (2) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than
Indebtedness owed to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary); or (3) in the case of an Asset
Disposition that does not constitute Collateral, to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (I) Pari Passu
Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) at a price
of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, (ii) through
repurchase of such Pari Passu Indebtedness in the open market or (iii) pursuant to the contractual
optional redemption provisions applicable thereto or (II) Senior Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more than 100% of
the principal amount of such Senior Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, (ii) through repurchase of such Senior
Indebtedness in the open market or (iii) pursuant to the contractual optional redemption provisions
applicable thereto; provided that in the case of the prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption
of Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness (in each case, other than the Notes) pursuant to
sub-clause (3), the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem the Notes on a pro rata basis with
such other Indebtedness;

(b) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) within
365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant
to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as
such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

(c) to make a capital expenditure pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved
by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent; provided, however, that any such capital
expenditure made that is executed or approved within such time will only satisfy this requirement so
long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

(d) to make Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (11) of the third paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” with the Net Available Cash from Asset
Dispositions; or


-----

(e) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a), (b),_
(c), (d) or (e) above, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or committed to
be applied or invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount
equal to the difference will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day
(or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent pursuant to clauses
(b) or (c) of the second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the
Parent elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of £33.0 million and 13.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA, the Parent will be required to make an offer (or procure an offer is made) (an “Asset
_Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Parent so elects, to all holders or lenders of other_
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to prepay or purchase (as applicable) the maximum aggregate principal
amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may
be prepaid or purchased (as applicable) out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in
an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of
the principal amount of such Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in
each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of prepayment or purchase (as
applicable), in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered
by the Holders or accepted by holders or lenders of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness for prepayment or
purchase (as applicable) and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for
general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes surrendered by Holders and Pari Passu Indebtedness of its holders or lenders
prepaid in any Asset Disposition Offer, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess
Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness to be prepaid or
purchased (as applicable) on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool-factor on the basis of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be prepaid or purchased (as applicable), or by such other
method as (i) the Trustee and (ii) the trustee, agent or similar representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness,
after consultation with the Parent, deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable
legal, depositary and exchange requirements). For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount
of any such Indebtedness not denominated in pound sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by
converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as of a date
selected by the Parent that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined herein). Upon completion
of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in
respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which the relevant Notes are
denominated that is actually received upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 10
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Parent will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent
it so elects, any Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be prepaid or purchased (as applicable) pursuant to this
covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been
validly tendered by the Holders or accepted by holders or lenders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness, for
prepayment or purchase (as applicable), the Notes and all Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or accepted
(as applicable) in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered by the Holders or accepted
by holders or lenders of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness for prepayment or purchase (as applicable) and


-----

not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been validly tendered or accepted (as applicable) and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered or accepted (as applicable) and not properly withdrawn and, in the
case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.
The Parent will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were
accepted for payment in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Parent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver (or procure the mail or delivery) to each tendering Holder an amount
equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and
accepted for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the
Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will (via an authenticating agent) authenticate
and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new
Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of £100,000 or in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or
transferred by book entry) by the Parent or the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Parent or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the
Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Parent and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after the Issue Date from Persons who
are not the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of £33.0 million and 13.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Parent will comply (or procure compliance), to the extent applicable, with the requirements of
Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the
repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Parent will comply (or procure
compliance) with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Parent is unable to
obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Parent determines that it will not maintain such listing,
it will obtain and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a listing of such Notes on
another stock exchange deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of
any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Parent (such transaction or series of


-----

related transactions, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
£22.0 million and 9.0% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Parent or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of £33.0 million
and 13.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions
taken as a whole have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the
Parent resolving that such transaction or series of related transactions complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to sub-clause (9)(b) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Parent, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Holding Company, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation,
health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto and any transaction
pursuant to or in connection with an MEP, incentive scheme, deferred compensation or similar
arrangement (including any MEP Payment);

(4) any transaction between or among the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or
any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding
Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any
of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Refinancing Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Parent or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant
to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not
materially more disadvantageous to the Holders taken as a whole in the good faith judgment of an
Officer of the Parent and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing
agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement and the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in
the ordinary course of business;

(8) any payments arising on the exercise of any put or call options (or any equivalent right or obligation) in
relation to any Associate or transactions with customers, clients, landlords, suppliers or purchasers or
sellers of goods or services, which, in each case, are in the ordinary course of business and are either fair
to the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;


-----

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Parent or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated
Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent in their reasonable determination, (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with
respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable and
(c) directors’ qualifying shares and shares issued to foreign nationals as required by applicable law;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) below, (a) payments by the
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including
through any Holding Company) of annual management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and
related expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed £5.0 million in each twelve month period
commencing on the Issue Date, and (b) customary payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Holding Company) for
financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other
investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments
in respect of this sub-clause (b) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Parent in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted
Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Parent and its Subsidiaries;

(13) any transaction effected pursuant to or in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(14) any transaction as to which the Parent delivers to the Trustee a written opinion from an Independent
Financial Advisor stating that the transaction (a) is fair to the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries from
a financial point of view, or (b) meets the requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ended after the Issue Date, 150 days) after the end
of the Parent’s fiscal year, beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date, annual reports
containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets
of the Parent as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements
and statements of cash flow of the Parent for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete
footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the
Parent (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or
balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year (and which have not already been the subject of pro forma information provided by
the Parent); (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a
discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of the
Parent, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies;
(d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate
transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt
instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 90 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Parent,
beginning with the fiscal quarter ending July 4, 2021, all quarterly reports of the Parent containing the
following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such
fiscal quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recently


-----

completed fiscal quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and
the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma
income statement information and balance sheet information of the Parent (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not
reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant fiscal quarter (and which have not
already been the subject of pro forma information provided by the Parent); (c) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial
condition and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Parent, and a discussion of
material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the
most recent report; and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition, restructuring, merger or similar
transaction, or any senior executive officer changes at the Parent or change in auditors of the Parent or
any other material event that the Parent announces publicly, a report containing a description of such
event.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that in the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, earlier periods
may be presented on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided for below, no report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Parent. At the Parent’s election it may also include
financial statements of a Holding Company in lieu of those for the Parent; provided that, if the financial
statements of a Holding Company are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material
differences between the financial statements of the Holding Company and the Parent shall be included for any
period after the Issue Date. Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or
the listing of such Capital Stock on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and
(3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements
of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the
case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together
with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, which
reconciliation shall include the following items: revenue, finance costs, profit/loss for the period, cash and
cash equivalents, total assets, total liabilities, equity and capital expenditures.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clause (1), (2) and (3) of
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post
copies of such reports on such password protected website as may be then maintained by the Parent and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as
determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Board
of Directors or an Officer of the Parent determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in
the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially
reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the
Notes.

The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if
and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, at the offices of the Listing Agent in Jersey.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Parent is not
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the
Parent shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for information
purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained
therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.


-----

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer and the Parent_

Neither the Issuer nor the Parent will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or
substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless (and subject to the other terms of the Indenture):

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) (if not the Parent or the Issuer,
as applicable) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any Permissible Jurisdiction and
the Successor Company (if not the Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) will expressly assume (subject in
each case to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles), (a) by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) to the
extent required by applicable law to effect such assumption, all obligations of the Parent or the Issuer, as
applicable, under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be permitted
to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such transaction is consummated would
not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Parent shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) complies with the Indenture, and that all
conditions precedent provided for therein relating to such transaction have been complied with or
satisfied, and that the assumption (if any) of obligations under clause (1) above constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Successor Company. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively
on such Officer’s Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to
be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such
transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect
thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Parent, which properties and
assets, if held by the Parent instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Parent on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent, as the case may be.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Parent under the Indenture and the Notes but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—Subsidiary
_Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary_
may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
the Parent and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine
with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this
sentence), the Parent may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Parent, reincorporating the Parent in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Parent.


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant)
will not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Parent has complied with
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a
new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor may (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement):

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Subsidiary Guarantor, unless,

(A) the other Person is the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
expressly assumes (in each case, subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security
Principles) all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and, to the extent
required by applicable law to effect such assumption, the obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a
party, in each case, subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles; and
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in
each case other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding sub-clause (B) and the provisions described under “—The Issuer and the
_Parent” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary that is_
not a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of
its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor and (b) if there is more than one Subsidiary Guarantor,
any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of
their respective properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
the preceding sub-clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a
Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating the
Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Subsidiary Guarantor, as the
case may be.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions
will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,”
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—Additional Note Guarantees and_
_Collateral”and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger_
_and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent” (together, the “Suspended Covenants”) and, in each case, any_
related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Parent and


-----

its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to
their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly
taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no Default
will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was
suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event
will be classified, at the Parent’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second
paragraph of such covenant, to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as
of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and
outstanding on the Reversion Date. To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred
under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such
Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted
under sub-clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

In addition, on the Reversion Date, (1) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date
pursuant to an agreement entered into during the continuance of the Suspension Event shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions” and (2) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to_
take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the
continuance of the Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to sub-clause (1)(d) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied,
although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the Suspended Covenants. The
Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of any Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants shall be reinstated on and from the Reversion Date, no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture with respect to
the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any
actions taken or events occurring during the continuance of the Suspension Event, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during the continuance of the Suspension Event, in each
case, as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the continuance of the
Suspension Event (or, upon termination of the Suspension Event or after that time based solely on any action
taken or event that occurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event), and following a Reversion
Date, the Parent and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising
during any Suspension Event and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in connection
with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of
the Parent, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Parent elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any
Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up
to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the prior paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that
(1) the Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more
recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the
relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics and (2) save as contemplated in clause
(1) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the
relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would
at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with


-----

as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric
will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of
Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would
at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the
occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not
be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or
incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based
basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be calculated
without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the Parent and
its Restricted Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility, bank guarantee facility or
bonding facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under the Revolving Credit
Facility, any guarantee facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a revolving facility or
guarantee facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
_permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission_
of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an acquisition
or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased
to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions
and/or investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

If a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant
to a numerical permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission,
unless otherwise elected by the Parent, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall
automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period or
any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”): (a) at the option of the Parent, the maximum
amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an
amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately
preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Restricted Group during
such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the
permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately
following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and
(b) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (a) of this paragraph, any usage of such Applicable Metric
during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry
Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior
to any increase in accordance with clause (a) of this paragraph; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, when calculating any financial definition or ratio
under the Indenture, the Parent shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other
negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from (1) the Refinancing
Transactions; (2) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the
Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting; (3) start-up costs for new businesses and branding
or re-branding of existing businesses; (4) costs or expenses relating to employee relocation, retraining,
severance and termination, business interruption, reorganization and other restructuring or cost cutting
measures, the rationalization, re-branding, start up, reduction or elimination of product lines, assets or
businesses, the consolidation, relocation or closure of retail, administrative or production locations and other
similar items (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any related capital expenditure); and/or (5) research and
development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof).

**_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Parent will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors or


-----

the Issuer, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or
other Indebtedness that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or any Public Debt exceeding £20.0 million in principal amount, in whole or
in part unless, in each case, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other
Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the
form attached to the Indenture or other appropriate agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary
will provide a Note Guarantee on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture, which
Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the
Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee.

Following the provision of any additional Guarantees as described above, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (if such security is being
granted in respect of the other Indebtedness), any such Guarantor will provide security over certain of its
material assets (excluding any assets of such Guarantor which are subject to a Permitted Lien at the time of
the execution of such supplemental indenture if providing such security interest would not be permitted by
the terms of such Permitted Lien or by the terms of any obligations secured by such Permitted Lien) to secure
its Note Guarantee on a first priority basis consistent with the security agreements related to the existing
Collateral.

Each additional Guarantee or security will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, the Parent will not be obligated to cause such Restricted
Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such
Note Guarantee could or the grant of such security would be inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement
or the Agreed Security Principles.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take any action, which action would
have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood
that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in
respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest
with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien over any of the Collateral
that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens;” _provided that the Parent and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled
“—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged,
transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien in
accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or released to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change
thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that (except
where permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of
Permitted Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and the holders of other Indebtedness
Incurred in accordance with the Indenture) no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated or otherwise modified or released unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,


-----

renewal, restatement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Parent delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from
an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank which confirms the solvency of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the relevant Person
which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any
qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a
lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, modified or released and replaced are valid and
perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at
law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, modification or release and replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured by
the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject. In the event that the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply
with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary
protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the
Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of the Issuer’s
obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above or the obligations of the
Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”above
(in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under
clause (2) above);

(4) failure to comply by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after written notice by the
Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”);_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates £30.0 million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the Parent, TopCo or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);


-----

(7) failure by the Issuer, the Parent, a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
£30.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability
for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment
becomes final and due (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any material Collateral having a fair market value
in excess of £30.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or such Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable in a final non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or the Issuer shall
assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues
for 10 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(9) any Note Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture), or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Note Guarantee in writing, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of the Note
Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify
the Parent of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7), the Parent does not cure such default
(or arranges for such default to be cured) within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable,
of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee by notice to the Parent, or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Parent and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional
Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium
and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately.
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) of
this “Events of Default” section has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes
shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing
Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and
be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to (i) nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any and (ii) a covenant or provision which under the Indenture
cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding, each of which may only be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least
90% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to
such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,


-----

liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of
prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the offer of security
and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding); and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture
will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required
in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own
affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against all losses and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing
of such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 90 days
after being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium,
if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Parent is required to deliver to the
Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate signed by an authorized representative
of the Parent indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written
notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status
and what action the Parent is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances,
but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It
may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it,
and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce
the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, such Notes); provided that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, waive or
modify one or more series of the Notes, at the election of the Parent only the consent of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of each such series (and not the consent of at least a majority
of all Notes then outstanding) shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less
than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (8) and (9), 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of


-----

Notes (or if such amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, waive or modify one or more
series of the Notes, at the election of the Parent, the same percentage of the relevant one or more series of
Notes), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment of principal or interest on or
with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the Guarantors from their obligations under their respective Note
Guarantees or the Indenture, except otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the material Collateral, other than
pursuant to the terms of the Security Document or the Indenture, as applicable, except as permitted by
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent holding not
less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (8) and (9), 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal
amount of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Parent, the Issuer, the Guarantors,
the Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision of the Note
Documents to the “Description of the Notes”contained in an Offering Memorandum, (to the extent such
amendment or supplement is in respect of Note Documents for a new series of Notes without affecting
the Note Documents for Notes already in issue), or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors
under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a
manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code) or change
the minimum denominations for the Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer, the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or does

-----

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral” to add Note Guarantees, add security to or for the benefit of_
the Notes, or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee
or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with
respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is
permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents;

(8) conform the text of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the
_Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the_
Security Documents or the Notes;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note
Document; or

(10) in the case of the Security Documents, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien
Facility Agreement in any property which is required by the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second
Lien Facility Agreement (in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the
extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with._

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems
appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any amendment, supplement and
waiver.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have concurred
in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer, will be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding (save as provided in the ninth paragraph of the provisions described under
“—Change of Control”).

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its, TopCo’s and each Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and
the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations
concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and
the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to
the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time
will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its, TopCo’s and each Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant


-----

described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent” and the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and
“—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of
_Default” above, the operation of the cross default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions,_
the bankruptcy provisions, the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security
default provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise
of the covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because
of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (other than with
respect to the Issuer and the Parent), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose)_
cash in pound sterling, UK Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in pound sterling and UK
Government Obligations, in each case, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the good faith determination
of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, which counsel is qualified to practice in the United States, to the effect that
Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the
Issue Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Document will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided
for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become
due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be
called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent by
the Trustee for this purpose), cash in pound sterling, UK Government Obligations or a combination of cash
in pound sterling and UK Government Obligations and, in each case, in an amount sufficient, in the good
faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent to pay and discharge the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have


-----

become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has
paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent
under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge”section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of
the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as
to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, TopCo or the Parent, any of the
Parent’s Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of
the Issuer, TopCo or the Guarantors under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

GLAS Trust Company LLC is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which the Trustee has received written notice,
the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of
an Event of Default of which the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the
Parent, the Issuer and their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by giving notice to the Trustee and the Issuer, or may
resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires a conflict of interest in its capacity as Trustee that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of
acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder
who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if emailed to them at their respective email addresses in the register
of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, if and for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer
will notify the Exchange of any notices with respect to the Notes. For so long as any Notes are represented by
Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, for further transmission to the holders of Book-Entry
Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
emailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the day after
being so emailed. Any notice or communication emailed to a Holder shall be emailed to such Person’s email
addresses in the register of the Holders and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so emailed within the


-----

time prescribed. Failure to email, cause to be delivered or otherwise transmit a notice or communication to a
Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is emailed or delivered in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the
addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes or
any Note Guarantee will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed
three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

Pound sterling is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the relevant Note Guarantees, as the case may be,
including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than pound sterling, whether as a
result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or
dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such
Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the pound sterling amount which the recipient is able to purchase
with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if
it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that pound sterling amount is less than the pound sterling amount expressed to be due to the recipient or
the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by
such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for
the Holder or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of
information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate
and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s other obligations, will give rise to a separate
and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any
other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or to
the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any pound
sterling-denominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a currency other than pound sterling shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such non-pound sterling amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since all the assets of the Issuer, TopCo and the Guarantors are held or located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, TopCo or any Guarantor, including judgments
with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, may not be
collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes
and the Note Guarantees, the Issuer, TopCo and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to
the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County
and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

taking into account any adjustments to be made to Consolidated EBITDA), (ii) in determining the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence,
repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if such
transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period, (iii) calculations shall also give pro forma
effect to any Specified Transaction that has occurred since the beginning of such period but which has not yet
been fully reflected in the relevant period (as determined and calculated by a responsible financial or

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially
be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global
_Note”). The Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons and are outside the United States in reliance on_
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note” and together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the
“Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the
limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities
in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the
Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not
be considered the owners or “holders” of the Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which
they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes
under the Indenture.

Neither we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of our or their respective
agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in
respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described
in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be
issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear
the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.


-----

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall
be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will
be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in
connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer
than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate, provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 or
€100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent for onward payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with
their customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding
for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever
nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under_
“Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts” above, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary
in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests
after such deduction or withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise
received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding
or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments
by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will
treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or
its nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of us, the Trustee or any of their agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream in pound sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in
respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or


-----

participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in
the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if
there is an Event of Default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the
Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s or
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which
require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its
interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.”Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry**
**Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.**

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or
Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of
the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global
Note.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued,
without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry
Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that
hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such
Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note, if any,
representing Notes of that same series.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described in the Indenture and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written
certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and
accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system


-----

and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream
interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions
such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and
trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest
to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The
laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange for
the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in
the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation
to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at
any time. None of us, any guarantor, the Trustee or our or their respective agents will have any responsibility
for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in pound sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax consequences of_
_purchasing, holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile,_
_including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a_
_comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell_
_Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you._
_The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as_
_in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change,_
_possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes. This summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets within the meaning
of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) by U.S. holders (as defined
herein) who purchase the Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their “issue price”(the first price at which
a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, any of the following:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

- a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect
under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the
tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes, you
should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable
to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation:

- a broker or dealer in securities or currencies;

- a financial institution;

- a regulated investment company;

- a real estate investment trust;

- a tax-exempt organization;

- an insurance company;

- a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or
a straddle;

- a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for his securities;

- a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement (or an investor in such an entity or arrangement);

- a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or

- a U.S. expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as
of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in U.S.
federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any


-----

rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no
assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or
disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you in
light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution tax on net investment
income, the alternative minimum tax or the effects of any U.S. state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. It is not
intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser of Notes.

If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular
U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well
as the consequences to you arising under other U.S. federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing
jurisdiction.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

An IPO Pushdown (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) could result in a taxable exchange of the
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case you may recognize gain or loss on the Notes
(although any such loss may be disallowed) at such time equal to the difference, if any, between the issue price
of the deemed newly issued Notes (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and your adjusted tax
basis in the Notes, and have a new holding period and tax basis in the Notes. Any such gain or loss will be
taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable
_Disposition of the Notes.” If the fair market value of the Notes at the time of such taxable exchange were_
lower than the stated redemption price by more than a de minimis amount, you may be required to include the
difference as ordinary income as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) in advance of the receipt of
cash. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences to
you in the event of an IPO Pushdown.

**_Payments of Interest_**

It is expected, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original
issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note (including any foreign tax withheld
and additional amounts paid in respect thereof) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time
it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You
may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the
election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax
year). Interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign
source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category
income. You generally will be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes
where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk
of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors
regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.

Interest on the Notes will be payable in pound sterling. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the pound sterling
received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted into U.S. dollar. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such
payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the pound sterling so received).

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine the
amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under
the first method, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S.
dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Notes held during such year, determined by translating
such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such
interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of
the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the
spot rate on:

- the last day of the accrual period;

- the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or


-----

- the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual
period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments
from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax
advisor as to the advisability of making the above election.

In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note
(including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but
unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by
translating the pound sterling received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S.
dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as
determined above).

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, you generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which
will be taxable as interest income as discussed above in “—Payments of Interest”) and the adjusted tax basis in
the Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you
purchased your Note with pound sterling, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the pound
sterling paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold,
exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for pound sterling, the amount
realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the pound sterling received based on the spot rate in effect on
the date of such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method
taxpayer and the Notes are traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
pound sterling paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollar at the spot rate on the settlement date of the
purchase or sale. If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may
elect the settlement date treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established
securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that such election is applied consistently to
all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of
the IRS.

Except with respect to foreign currency gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed
below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term
capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate
U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or
loss.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain
or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. For these
purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in pound sterling on
the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between
(i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal
amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis
or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchases and taxable disposition, if the Note
is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The amount of
exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note (with respect to both principal and accrued
interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note.

**_Disposition of Pound Sterling_**

Your tax basis in the pound sterling received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in
effect on the date the pound sterling is received. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or
other taxable disposition of the pound sterling will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or
loss.


-----

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) under the Indenture.
Even if these Additional Notes are treated as part of the same series as the Notes for non-tax purposes, in
some cases they may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For instance,
Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable series of Notes previously
issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If you are a U.S. holder considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of
this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the
particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such
Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of Additional Notes that are not fungible with the
applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which
nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

U.S. Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign
currency transactions. Under the U.S. Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported
to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the
extent that such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in
excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of a Note, you should consult with your tax
advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including
any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of interest and principal on a Note,
or the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient.
Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments,
fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject
to backup withholding on any such payments or proceeds.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding backup
withholding and information reporting requirements relating to your ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain
exceptions (including an exception for the Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions),
by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Financial Assets, with their tax return for
each year in which they hold an interest in the Notes. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the
application of these rules to your ownership of the Notes and potential penalties for failure to comply.

**Certain UK Taxation Considerations**

The comments below are of a general nature and are not intended to be an exhaustive summary of all UK tax
considerations relating to the Notes. They relate only to certain aspects of United Kingdom tax, and in
particular do not address the United Kingdom tax consequences of disposing of the Notes. They are based
on current UK tax law as applied in England and Wales and HMRC published practice (which may not be
binding on HMRC), both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. They do not
address the consequences of any substitution of the Issuer or further issues of securities that will form a single
series with the Notes (notwithstanding that such substitution or further issue may be permitted by the terms
and conditions of the Notes). They do not necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to
be the income of any other person. The UK tax treatment of prospective holders of Notes depends on their
individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. The comments below relate only to the
position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and any interest payable on their Notes
and who hold Notes as a capital investment. Certain classes of persons (such as brokers, dealers, certain


-----

professional investors or persons connected with the Issuer) may be subject to special rules and the comments
below do not apply to such holders of the Notes. The comments below do not purport to constitute legal or
tax advice. Any prospective holders of Notes who are in doubt as to their own tax position, or who may be
subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the UK, should consult their professional advisors.

**_Payments of Interest by the Issuer—Withholding Tax_**

If and while the Notes continue to be listed on a recognized stock exchange within the meaning of Section 1005
of the Income Tax Act 2007, payments of interest by the Issuer may be made without withholding or
deduction for or on account of UK tax. The Exchange is a recognized stock exchange for these purposes. The
Notes will be treated for these purposes as listed on the Exchange where they are admitted to trading on the
Exchange and are included in the Official List of the Exchange in accordance with provisions corresponding
to those generally applicable in countries in the EEA.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK tax where
the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes at the time
the payment is made that (i) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a UK resident company, (ii) the
person beneficially entitled to the interest is a non-UK resident company that carries on a trade in the UK
through a permanent establishment and the payment is one that the non-UK resident company is required to
bring into account when calculating its profits subject to UK corporation tax or (iii) the person to whom the
payment is made is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out
in Sections 935-937 of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that in each case HMRC has not given a direction,
the effect of which is that the payment may not be made without that withholding or deduction.

In most other cases, interest will generally be paid by the Issuer under deduction of UK tax at the basic rate
(currently 20%) unless the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HMRC in respect of such relief
as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

If interest were paid under deduction of UK tax (e.g., if the Notes are not or cease to be listed on the Exchange
and no other relief or exemption is available), holders of the Notes who are not resident in the UK may be
able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double
taxation treaty.

Any premium payable on redemption of the Notes may be treated as a payment of interest for UK tax
purposes and may accordingly be subject to the UK withholding tax treatment described above.

**_Payments of Interest by the Issuer—Direct Assessment_**

Interest and premium, if any, on the Notes is expected to have a UK source for tax purposes and accordingly
may be chargeable to UK tax by direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without
withholding or deduction. However, interest and premium, if any, paid without withholding or deduction for
or on account of UK tax will not be assessed to UK tax in the hands of holders (other than certain trustees)
who are not resident for tax purposes in the UK, except where (a) the holder of the Notes carries on a trade,
profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency, or in the case of a corporate holder, carries on
a trade through a permanent establishment in the UK, and (b) the interest and premium, if any, is received in
connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that branch, agency or permanent establishment. There are
exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment
managers).

Holders of the Notes should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in
“Description of the Notes-Additional Amounts” above would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly
the person entitled to the relevant interest to UK tax. However exemption from, or reduction of, such UK tax
liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty.

**_Payments Under a Guarantee_**

The UK withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor under the terms of a Guarantee in respect of
interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed
for the Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemption
from withholding for or on account of UK tax in respect of securities listed on a recognized stock exchange
described above in relation to payments of interest by the Issuer. Accordingly, if a Guarantor makes any such
payments and they have a UK source, these may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently
20%).


-----

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_**

No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”) is payable on the issue of the Notes, or on a transfer
of the Notes assuming that (i) the interest on the Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial return on
the nominal amount of the capital and (ii) any right on repayment of the Notes to an amount which exceeds
the nominal amount of the Notes is reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a
similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the
London Stock Exchange.

**_Information Reporting_**

HMRC has powers to obtain information and documents relating to the Notes, including in relation to issues
of and other transactions in the Notes, interest, payments treated as interest and other payments derived from
the Notes. This may include the value of the Notes, details of the beneficial owners of the Notes, of the person
for whom the Notes are held and of the persons to whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be
paid. Information may be obtained from a range of persons including persons who effect or are a party to
such transactions on behalf of others, registrars and administrators of such transactions, the registered
holders of the Notes, persons who make, receive or are entitled to receive payments derived from the Notes
and persons by or through whom interest and payments treated as interest are paid or credited.

Information obtained by HMRC may, in certain circumstances, be exchanged by HMRC with the tax
authorities of other jurisdictions.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND LOCAL LAW LIMITATIONS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests_
_relating to the Notes, and of certain insolvency law considerations in England and Wales and Jersey, where the_
_Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security (as at the date hereof) are organized or incorporated. It is a_
_summary only. Bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a similar event could be initiated in any of these_
_jurisdictions and/or in the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation of a future guarantor under the Notes._
_The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law_
_should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the_
_Notes, the Guarantees and any security securing the Notes._

_Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in England and Wales and Jersey. In_
_the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors or providers of Collateral experiences financial_
_difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar_
_proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the_
_enforceability of the obligations and the security granted by any of the Issuer and the Guarantors._

**England and Wales**

**_United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU_**

Following a national referendum in June 2016, the UK exercised its right pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty
on the EU to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU and ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31,
2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“Exit Day”). As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the
Recast Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such
EU regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified
or re-enacted by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under that
EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA.

On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m.
(London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a member state
of the EU, including for the purpose of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period,
the UK ceased to be treated as a member state of EU.

The Recast Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2020 and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019) (the “Insolvency
_Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings_
under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, providing for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings
commenced in other Member States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the Recast Insolvency
Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main
proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the Recast Insolvency Regulation will not
continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided
that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency
proceedings commenced in other Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency
proceedings.

The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU
Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day,
amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to
establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP Day Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended
by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency
proceedings in the UK in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the
purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and:

- the center of the debtor’s main interests is in the UK; or

- the center of the debtor’s main interests is in a Member State and there is an establishment in the UK.

These tests are consistent with the Recast Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a
debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the
Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the UK court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there


-----

to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (A) there is a reasonable possibility, if a
winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (B) one or more persons
interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise
jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under
UK insolvency laws, even if its center of main interests is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the
UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its center of main interests in a
Member State, to enter into administration.

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under the
laws of England and Wales (each an “English company”). The courts of England and Wales would have
jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company.

In addition, the UK Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model
Law on Cross Border Insolvency in Great Britain and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject
to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain
collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the
English courts as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign
non main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.
Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency
proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings
opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great
Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English
compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain,
including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but
the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such
a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non
main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways.
These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to
court for an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge”
(discussed below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator
out of court, or, in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or
the company resolving by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. On the Issue Date, the obligations
under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantees and the Notes will be secured by security interests
over the Initial Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a
Guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations
on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely
affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the
Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended, the “Insolvency Act”) and the onshored version of the Recast
Insolvency Regulation (which pursuant to the Insolvency Amendment Regulations has been substantially
amended) provide that an administrator may be appointed (whether in or out of court) in respect of an
English company or Scottish company, a company incorporated in an EEA state, a company not incorporated
in an EEA state but with its COMI in a member state of the EU (other than Denmark), a company (wherever
incorporated) having its COMI in the UK or a company (wherever incorporated) with its COMI in a member
state of the EU and an “establishment” in the UK.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration
order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is


-----

likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the
purpose of administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow”basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall
due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount
of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). “Cash flow” insolvency is
presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt
exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order).
The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern
or, if that is not reasonably practicable or if the following would achieve a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon
immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the
creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or
more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is
set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency”).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder
of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined herein) granted by the company and which has become
enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the
identity of the appointer.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the
Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a
floating charge).

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon
the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce
security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court.
The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process
(including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the
company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for
permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim
moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but
not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as
a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an
administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be
appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is
proposed to be appointed by the company or directors).

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to
realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This
is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement”
(generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt
instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as
amended) (see further below).

If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security
granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the
administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A
demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could
be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the
permission of the court.

Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, or the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into
administration, the Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to
the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in
administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

As set out above, the Insolvency Act empowers the English courts to make an administration order in respect
of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the


-----

company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has
become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company,
the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for
the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the
qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of
the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The
most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception
relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English
obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves
the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated,
listed or traded debt instrument) as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If an administrative
receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company,
its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if
the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security
pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an
undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative
receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do
so by the administrator.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which
(a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the
holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be
the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any
fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s
property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in
the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other
carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by
the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a
company’s property.”

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the
benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating
charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum
aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment)
Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a firstranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000).
The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefits. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of
secured creditors.

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a
prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for
unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral
arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/
3226)), as set out below.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and, where
the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement,
use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which include the
administrator’s remuneration and can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s
business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge,
even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the
charged assets (provided the fixed charge holder has no notice of any restrictions); (c) provided that the floating
charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, general
costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable


-----

out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to the
claims of the floating charge holder; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to
deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that
such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the
assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security may be subject to certain challenges under English
insolvency law (see “—Grant of floating charge”); and (f) where the floating charge is not created or does not
otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the
claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee
holiday claims, certain unpaid pension contributions, and VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC)
and (ii) as noted above, subject to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) for unsecured
creditors; and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating
charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court approval but the floating charge holder retains
the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. With
prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that
disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies
the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the
company to the charge holder.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to
be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the
description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting
to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will
depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant
chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a
purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary
course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those
assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported
fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings; and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security
may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and
therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.”

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts
have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise or arrangement between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) in respect of the company’s obligations to those
creditors. An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition,
a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient
connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to
satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other
things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset
or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or
jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly
incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations
of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations
of the existing obligors would be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and
circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional
requirements would be satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such
creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company
or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and
voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the
terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the
sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not


-----

participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by
the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant
procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled
to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction
the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. The
court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration. A scheme of
arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims
against third parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as
applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors
which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a
rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite
majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all
unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary
arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A
company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority
to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except
with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by
value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary
arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who
votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its
security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement.
However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail
unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the shareholders
should prevail.

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

As noted above (see “—United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU”), the Recast Insolvency Regulation (as
amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) provides that, in addition to any other grounds to
establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, a company which has its center of main interests in the
UK, or which has its center of main interests in a Member State and an establishment in the UK, may be
subject to compulsory liquidation or (with confirmation by the court) a creditors’ voluntary liquidation in the
UK. In the case of compulsory liquidation, even if a foreign company has neither its center of main interests
or an establishment in the UK, it may be wound up as an unregistered company if the court considers there to
be (i) a sufficient connection with England and Wales, (ii) a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is
made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (iii) one or more persons interested in the
distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise a jurisdiction.

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority
prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this
task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of windingup: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’
voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s
members. The difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the
company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following
12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory
winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration)
is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some
degree of control by the creditors.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up.
In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void.


-----

However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise
arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined
herein). Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court,
it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. As a result of
certain temporary changes introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, the impact of
Section 127 of the Insolvency Act has been altered such that the relevant date for considering whether a
disposition of property is void is no longer the date on which the petition was presented, but instead, the date
on which the winding-up order was granted. Once the temporary changes cease on September 30, 2021 (or
such later date as may be imposed), the relevant date is expected to return to the date on which the petition is
presented. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will
also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission
of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up
order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary
winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This
is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate
proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security).

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the
business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property
and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates
any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may
give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it
gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be
detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been
substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to
disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider
or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss
or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for
the loss or debt as a debt in the winding-up.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in
question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different
classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending
order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions
generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have
been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is,
the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being
taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net
balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or
distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as at the date of liquidation or
the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The
effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the
extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent
amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor,
receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply
to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a
certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the
application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency
set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised
before the time at which insolvency set-off applies).


-----

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is
less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the
possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they
have a proprietary interest only;

- Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the
subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or
liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any
priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not
have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed
fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types
of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they
are paid;

- Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of
priority in which expenses are paid);

- Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation
to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work
done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due
to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the
date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential
debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and
include: (a) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims
exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and
paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts
rank equally;

- Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein)
only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors;

- Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would
include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which,
on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge;

- Seventh ranking:

   - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured
creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

   - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual
rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in
respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an
administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of
interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders
of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such
security recoveries; and

   - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and

- Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

See “Administration and Floating Charges” above for a description of the Prescribed Part.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security or guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise
if the company enters administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below)
after the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or
liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or
security given by such company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of
action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security
interests:

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the
relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or
a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee
constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the
company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives
consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such
company.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence
of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency
Act) and (ii) if the English company enters into liquidation or administration within two years from the date
on which the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company
was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person
(as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the
connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings.

In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in
good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable
grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it
would have been if the transaction had not been entered into.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the
relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or
a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee
constituted a preference.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or
a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the
company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been
in had that transaction not been entered into.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence
of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency
Act) and (ii) if the English company enters into liquidation or administration within six months (if the
beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a
connected person) from the date on which the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee.

. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as
it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given.
However, the court will only make such an order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the
English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company


-----

was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined
in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and that it was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, and the connected person must demonstrate in such
proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption
of insolvency).

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined
above) and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is
making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in
relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court
as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may
be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant CVA or, subject to
certain conditions, the FCA, PRA and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is
capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in
administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit
within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time
of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the
court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction
had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court
order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the
person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in
property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and
without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the
transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless
such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Grant of Floating Charge_**

Under English insolvency law, if (i) an English company enters into liquidation or administration within one
year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) of
granting a floating charge and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the
English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating
charge will be invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to,
or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the
creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest). The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent
at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is
granted to a connected person.

No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in
part or in full) the relevant fixed charge; this will happen automatically if the statutory requirements are
fulfilled.

However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating charge will not be invalidated
on this basis.

**_Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003_**

The Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (the “Financial Collateral
_Regulations”), apply in respect of certain security interests granted over, and certain title transfer_
arrangements in, “financial collateral” (together, “financial collateral arrangements”). Financial collateral is
defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The definition
of “financial instruments”includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under
loans made by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was
to implement Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on
financial collateral arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the UK. The purpose of that directive was to simplify
the process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework.

If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations,
certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which (amongst other things) remove


-----

restrictions on enforcing security, disapply certain provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors in
administration or liquidation and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral
arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations
apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the
statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into
administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security
interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security
interest applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have become enforceable in
accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant
contract.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “Act”) enacted fundamental
reforms to the UK’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been proposed
in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID 19
pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following:

_(a) Moratorium_

The Act introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies
with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options.

Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up
under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services
companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to
capital market arrangements, including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). From October 1, 2021 (which
may be extended by the UK government), ineligible companies will also include any company that is subject
to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary
arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). Subject to what follows,
directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at
court. From October 1, 2021 (which may be extended by the UK government), directors must apply to court
to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the
court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the
company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the
court to commence a moratorium.

Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view,
the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency
practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among other things) that the
moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern or (until October 1, 2021
(which may be extended by the UK government)) would do so were it not for any worsening of the financial
position of the company for reasons relating to coronavirus. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a
moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent
that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern even if (until October 1, 2021 (which may be
extended by the UK government)) one were to disregard any worsening of the financial position of the
company for reasons relating to coronavirus and/or meet its financial obligations.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred
prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise
under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market
arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and
such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the
company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become
payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium.

During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company,
including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission
of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose
of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a
carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration and
_floating charges,” “—Grant of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)_


-----

_Regulations 2003”above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted._
In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during
this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed.

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where
a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week
period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or
expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over
any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the
extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver).

A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day
on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the
directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor
must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by
the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of
rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the
company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40
business days) will be available:

i. pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the
possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50%
(by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of
unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with
pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or
may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote;

ii. pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit;

iii. automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented,
accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and

iv. at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the
moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan).

_(b) Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_

The Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the
imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been
triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such
proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new
moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of
the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate
the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is
suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding,
comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency
proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to
terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits
(where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial
services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and
parties) are not affected by this new prohibition.

_(c) Restructuring Plan_

The Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the
Companies Act 2006, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more
dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring
plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be
wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State
may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market
participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but
its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company).


-----

Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be
likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business
as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the
purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial
difficulties”test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its
debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring
plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano
Convention.

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must
be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or
members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of
stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it
is for the proponent to determine whether more the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple
classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected
by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring
plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court
will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most
likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors
whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However,
there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure
must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors
and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s)
must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material
interests in the company.

The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members
(or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or
class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast
to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the
plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium,
any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in
the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent.

Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan
requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion
to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote
in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if:

i. the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring
plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers to be
the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and

ii. the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors
or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the
event of that “relevant alternative” scenario.

A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in
favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for
registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in
the Gazette).

_(d) Modification of Wrongful Trading_

The Act provided for a temporary modification to the application of liability for wrongful trading by directors
with retrospective effect from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020. While this temporary modification
lapsed after September 30, 2020, it was revived in the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020
(Coronavirus) (Suspension of Liability for Wrongful Trading and Extension of the Relevant Period)
Regulations 2020 and thereafter extended pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020
(Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2021, so that it applied from November 26,
2020 until June 30, 2021. Wrongful trading provisions create a civil offence where a director of a company
that enters insolvent liquidation or administration has caused the company to continue to trade when they


-----

knew or ought to have known prior to the commencement of the insolvent liquidation or administration that
there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding insolvent liquidation or administration. The court
may declare that such a director is liable to make a contribution to the company’s assets unless they have taken
every step with a view to minimizing the potential loss to the company’s creditors as a whole.

These temporary measures were intended to protect directors from personal liability where they made
decisions to continue trading at a time when the risk of insolvency as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic was
high. Pursuant to these provisions, the court was required to assume that a director was not responsible for
any worsening of the financial position of the company or its creditors that occurred during the relevant
period. There was no requirement to show that the company’s worsening financial position was due to the
COVID 19 pandemic. Other provisions aimed at preventing director misconduct (such as fraudulent trading
under Section 213 of the Insolvency Act, general duties of directors under the Companies Act 2006 and
common law fiduciary duties) continued to apply.

This temporary modification to the application of liability for wrongful trading by directors did not apply to
directors of certain entities, including insurers, banks, securitization companies, parties to capital markets
arrangements and overseas entities with functions corresponding to these.

_(e) No winding up petitions or orders_

The Act, in tandem with the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of
the Relevant Period) (No. 2) Regulations 2021, has temporarily suspended the ability of creditors to present a
winding up petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021 (subject to extension)
on the basis of a company’s inability to pay its debts, unless the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that
the COVID 19 pandemic did not have a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay
its debts would have existed even if the COVID 19 pandemic had not had a financial effect on the company.
With regards to petitions that have been presented during this period but before the Act came into force, the
court can make such order as it thinks appropriate to restore the position to what it would have been if the
petition had not been presented. This could lead to the voiding of winding up orders made in respect of such
petitions.

Similarly, no winding up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis of an inability to
pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that the COVID 19 pandemic had a financial effect on the company
before the presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the inability to pay debts would
have existed even if the COVID 19 pandemic had not had a financial effect on the company. Any winding up
orders made during this period but before the Act came into force will be void and the court can give directions
to the insolvency official to restore the company to its “pre-petition” position.

_(f) Statutory demands_

Under the Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension
of the Relevant Period) (No. 2) Regulations 2021), as from April 27, 2020 the presentation of a winding up
petition will not be permitted on the basis of a statutory demand served during the period between March 1,
2020 and September 30, 2021 (subject to extension). This applies whether or not the COVID 19 pandemic had
an impact on the company’s failure to discharge the demand.

_(g) So-called “Henry VIII” powers_

The Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Change of
Expiry Date) Regulations 2021) further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a
range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations
until April 29, 2022. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be
met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to
change or disapply a person’s corporate duties and liabilities.

**_Extortionate Credit Transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A
transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally
or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened
ordinary principles of fair dealing.


-----

Where an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is
presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be
challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration
within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole
or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also
vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court
may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under
the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It
should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the
extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided
credit under it).

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the
office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pounds sterling at a single rate
for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the “relevant
date” (generally speaking, being the date on which the company entered administration or liquidation). This
provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable,
they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes
may be subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount proved between the date on which
such English obligor goes into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which
such holders of the Notes may become entitled. Any such holder of the Notes would not be entitled to make
a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of a fall in the value of pounds sterling between the “relevant
date” and the date of any distribution.

**_Security over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English obligor or over shares of the English obligor are typically, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an
encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at
the discretion of the court.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by an English company in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the
respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such
an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void
and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are
dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in
its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by
virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a
director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the
success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a
transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers
as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

H.I.J. Limited is incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of H.I.J.
Limited insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate
insolvency in Jersey: “désastre” and winding up (including just and equitable winding up and creditors’
winding up). The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the
application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey (the “Royal Court”) under the Bankruptcy (Désastre)
(Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en
_désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of “désastre,” title and possession of the property of the debtor_

vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date
of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not
commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to
recover the debt. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent
of the Viscount and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under
Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To
the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured
party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal
proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to
recover the balance of the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding up of an
insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a
liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint
a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up,
gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the
commencement of the winding up, no action can be taken or continued against the company except with the
leave of the Royal Court. The shareholders must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence
the creditors’ winding-up. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may,
however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any power of
enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that
the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the secured party has no other
remedy against the company without leave of the Royal Court. The corporate state and capacity of the
company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved.

The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an
arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding
up if (among other things) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.

**_Compromises and arrangements with creditors_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal Court
may sanction a compromise or arrangement (a “Scheme”) between a Jersey company and its creditors or
shareholders (or a class of either of them). The Royal Court may, on application of the company (or a creditor
or shareholder or, if the company is being wound up, a liquidator), order a meeting to be called at which the
proposed Scheme must be agreed to by a majority in number representing:

- 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

- 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy before the Royal Court considers the
sanction of the Scheme. If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of the relevant class of either
of them) agree to the Scheme and, following such agreement, the Royal Court sanctions the Scheme, the
Scheme is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant class of either of them) and on the
company (or any liquidator and contributories of the company if the company is being wound up).

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared
“en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is instigated by
shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security interest) entered into
by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back period
from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre”during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes
a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a
transaction with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared


-----

“en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any
guarantee or security interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month
look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during
which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey
Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those
that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a
preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate transactions, onerous property, disclaimer and customary law fraudulent dispositions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared
“en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to
the debtor company which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of
commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to
examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed
provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is
extortionate.

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of the
declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within
six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the
company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other
immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that
it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable
contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the company/
debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/ Viscount from all liability in
respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the
declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from
liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a
disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have
standing as a creditor in the “désastre” or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim
onerous property.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey customary
law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors’
claims may be set aside.

**_Enforcement of security and security in insolvency_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have capacity to
grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any floating
charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property and
undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security
interest is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Jersey courts in respect of Jersey situs assets. The
Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the Enterprise
Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of
the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognize the powers of an administrator,
administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law
assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the
courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal
Court think fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even
though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature
and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s
insolvency regime.


-----

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the
UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal
Court. The Royal Court’s position may also not be in accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation.
Jersey does not form part of the EU for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the
Recast Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of
center of main interests does not apply.

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights
of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences, extortionate credit transactions,
disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey.

Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law.
The Jersey situs assets of H.I.J. Limited will be secured pursuant to Jersey law governed security interest
agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets
by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take certain
ancillary actions, including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement, to the extent
not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of
the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The
power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the
event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or
appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor
may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver
in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior
written notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest
in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not
less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest unless, in each
case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing.

There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement
by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in
the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or
sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case
of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms.
The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party
was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the
notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells
collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain
persons, any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in
the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation
or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation
or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured
party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of
priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing
statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the
appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured
party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is
satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any)
in payment to the relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its obligation above
with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid
out on the order of the court on application by a person entitled to the surplus.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be dated as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have
agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the principal amount of the Notes as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After
the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by
the Initial Purchasers without notice.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price
set forth on the cover page hereof. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of its
affiliates. To the extent an Initial Purchaser is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer, it will only offer and sell
Notes in the United States through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or affiliates, as appropriate. In
addition, the Initial Purchaser may offer and sell Notes outside the United States through its affiliates.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that neither the Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries will offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under
the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors and
having a tenor of more than one year during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and
including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Initial Purchasers acting as representatives under the Purchase Agreement.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold
within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented, warranted and agreed that:

- it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell, distribute or otherwise make
available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression
“retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client (as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II) or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in the Prospectus Regulation);

- it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any
Notes to any retail investor in the UK. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2
of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA), (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA) or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus
Regulation); and

- it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in
which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with
all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from
or otherwise involving the UK.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge
or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or
the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.
The Issuer and Guarantors have also agreed that neither they, nor any of their affiliates or any other person
acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchaser), will (i) solicit offers for, or offer or sell, the
Notes by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c)
of Regulation D or in any manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the


-----

U.S. Securities Act or (ii) engage in any directed selling efforts within the meaning of Regulation S, and all
such persons will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S.

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the
Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however
we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted
by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without
notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it
will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which
will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes
_and the Guarantees—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_
_the Notes may be limited.”_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing
transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to
reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are
purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions,
covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise
be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.
In connection with the Offering, a stabilizing manager, or person acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, a stabilizing
manager, or person acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose
of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. A stabilizing manager may also over allot the
Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover
the syndicate short position. In addition, a stabilizing manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market
making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities
may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise
prevail. A stabilizing manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any
time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—There may not_
_be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or
after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced,
may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are
commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and
60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter
market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking (including hedging) and/ or
commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the
ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions.
Each of Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc and Banco Santander, S.A., or their respective affiliates are
mandated lead arrangers, original lenders and/or bookrunners under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Second Lien Facility Agreement. HSBC Bank plc is the agent and HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK)
Limited is the security agent under these agreements. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business
activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments
and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments
(including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and
securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the


-----

Notes). The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer
routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in
securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

Each prospective purchaser of the Notes is advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale,
pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby. The Notes have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or
sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered
and sold only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act to persons
who are not U.S. persons and are outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act.

In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the Issue Date, an offer or
sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant
to Rule 144A.

Each purchaser of the Notes by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to
and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes (and the Guarantees) have not been registered under the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities law; are being offered for resale in transactions not
requiring registration under the Securities Act or any state securities law, including sales pursuant to
Rule 144A and Regulation S; and may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance
with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law, pursuant to
an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (5) and (10) below.

(2) It is not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of
the Issuer and it is either:

(a) a qualified institutional buyer and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A and the acquisition of the Notes will be for its own account or for the account of another
qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) not a U.S. person and is purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or the Initial
Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to the Offering or sale of any Notes (and the
Guarantees), other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering
Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with
respect to the Notes (and the Guarantees). It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any
person representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy,
adequacy or completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. It also
acknowledges that it has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes
(and the Guarantees) as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the
Notes (and the Guarantees).

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting
as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any state securities laws or
any other applicable laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its
or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of the Notes agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is

(ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act; (iii) for
so long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably
believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the account of a
qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act; (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States
in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption

accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities
laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s
rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an
opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each
of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the other side of
the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. Each purchaser acknowledges
that each note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR
PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED,
PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO,
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF (1) REPRESENTS THAT
(A) IT IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER (WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) OR (B) IT IS A NON-U.S. PERSON ACQUIRING THIS NOTE IN
AN “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION” PURSUANT TO RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT, (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR
FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED SECURITIES TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER
SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE, WHICH IS

[IN THE CASE OF RULE 144A NOTES: ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL
ISSUE DATE HEREOF (OR, IF LATER, THE ISSUE DATE OF ANY ADDITIONAL NOTES) AND
THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE
OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THIS SECURITY)] [IN THE CASE OF
REGULATION S NOTES: 40 DAYS AFTER THE LATER OF THE DATE WHEN THE SECURITIES
WERE FIRST OFFERED TO PERSONS OTHER THAN DISTRIBUTORS IN RELIANCE ON
REGULATION S AND THE DATE OF THE COMPLETION OF THE DISTRIBUTION] ONLY (A) TO
THE ISSUER OR THE GUARANTORS, (B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG
AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”), TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER (WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A) THAT PURCHASES FOR
ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO
WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE
144A, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (E) PURSUANT
TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO ANY
REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF
SUCH INVESTOR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR
CONTROL AND TO COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND
ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE
ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER
(I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSES (D) OR (E) TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF
THEM AND (II) IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE
OF TRANSFER IN THE FORM APPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS SECURITY IS
COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE TRUSTEE AND (3) AGREES


-----

THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS SECURITY IS TRANSFERRED A
NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.

(6) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such Notes.

(7) It acknowledges that the transfer agent will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any
Notes except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Trustee that the restrictions set
forth therein have been complied with.

(8) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be
subject to the selling and transfer restrictions set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

(9) It is not nor is it acting for the account of a retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client (as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II)
or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the
“Prospectus Regulation”)), and it further understands that no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or
distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

(10) It is not nor is it acting for the account of a retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA), (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA) or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in Article 2 of
the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus
_Regulation”)) and it further understands that no key information document required by the PRIIPs_
Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
UK has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

It acknowledges that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of
the Notes are no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as
a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with
respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this Offering
Memorandum and, to the extent provided to the Initial Purchasers by us for such purpose, any related
amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving this Offering
Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum acknowledges
that:

(1) such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us, and to review and has received, all
additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the
information herein;

(2) such person has not relied on the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with the Initial Purchasers in
connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and

(3) except as provided pursuant to (1) above, no person has been authorized to give any information or to
make any representation concerning the Notes offered hereby other than those contained herein and, if
given or made, such other information or representation should not be relied upon as having been
authorized by us or the Initial Purchasers.

Each person receiving this Offering Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this
Offering Memorandum may make a written request to receive a copy of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Moreover, for so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding and are restricted securities within the meaning
of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are not subject to Section 13
or 15(d) under the Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting thereunder pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the
Exchange Act, make available to any holder or beneficial holder of a Note, or to any prospective purchaser of
a Note designated by such holder or beneficial holder, the information specified in, and meeting the
requirements of, Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act upon the written request of any such holder or
beneficial owner. Any such request should be directed to the Registrar. All the above documents will be
available at the offices of the Registrar.

We are not currently subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements of the Exchange
Act. Pursuant to the Indenture and so long as the Notes are outstanding, we will furnish periodic information
to holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports.” For so long as the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange for dealing and the rules of that exchange so require,
copies of the organizational documents of the Issuer and the Guarantors, our most recent audited
consolidated directors’ report and financial statements, the Indenture (which includes the Guarantees and the
form of the Notes) and the Intercreditor Agreement will be available for review during normal business hours
on any business day at the office of the Registrar.

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and its registered office is in
England and Wales. The Guarantors are incorporated in, and have their respective principal executive offices
or registered offices, as applicable, in England and Wales or Jersey. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors
have agreed, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, to accept service of process in the United States
through agents designated for such purpose, it may not be possible for holders of the Notes to effect service of
process within the United States upon the Issuer, a Guarantor or such persons or to enforce against any of the
judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of
the United States, and there is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales or Jersey of civil liabilities
predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States, either in original actions or in actions for
enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court,
actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based
on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and
Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In
such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided
by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the following:

- the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original
proceedings according to English rules of international law;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in
respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to
penal, revenue or other public law.

An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that:

- the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy;

- the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of
the Act;

- the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial
justice;

- the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court
whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or conflicts with an earlier judgment of
such court;

- the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or

- the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the
dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose
jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit).

Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments that have been
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, we cannot assure you whether
an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in
England and Wales, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.


-----

**Jersey**

H.I.J. Limited is incorporated in Jersey. The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing
for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the
United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would
not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey,
proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a
Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court
(subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim
(assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey
court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws
principles;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are circumstances
where non-money judgments may also be recognized);

- the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed
as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the
United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice or
rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

- there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters
that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance that those
judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court
would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of
the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

In our opinion, Constellation Automotive Group Limited (formerly BBD Parentco Limited)’s Group financial
statements and Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 28 March 2021 and
of the Group’s loss and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual
Report’), which comprise: the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 28 March 2021; the consolidated
income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company cash
flow statements, and the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended;
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for
the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue to adopt
the going concern basis of accounting included:

- Audit of cash flow forecasts for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of the Group and
Company financial statements;

- Consideration of management’s key assumptions relating to their going concern assessment including
projected future operating cash flows, anticipated financing requirements and compliance with covenants
relating to borrowings anticipated to be utilised over the going concern review period; and

- Consideration of management’s sensitivity analysis including periods of lowest cash flow headroom and
their ability to retain sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations as they fall due even in a severe but
plausible downside scenario.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements
are authorised for issue.

**Conclusions relating to going concern continued**

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to
the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


-----

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express
an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance
thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of
the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based
on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic eport and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required
by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report
certain opinions and matters as described below.

_Strategic Report and irectors’ report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic
Report and Directors’ report for the year ended 28 March 2021 is consistent with the financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’
report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied
that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or
the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

_Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud, is detailed below.


-----

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of
non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the financial reporting requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and tax regulatory compliance in the UK and other jurisdictions, and we considered the extent to
which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We evaluated management’s
incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of
override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to a potential breach of the financial
reporting requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and non-compliance with regulation or laws relating to
tax. Audit procedures performed included:

- Financial statement review procedures against Companies Act 2006 requirements; and

- Audit of corporation tax and VAT including tax disclosures within the financial statements and uncertain
tax positions

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is
higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by,
for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in
writing.

**OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING**

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

Constellation Automotive Group Limited (formerly BBD Parentco Limited) (‘CAGL’, the ‘Company’) was
incorporated as a UK private company limited by shares on 10 June 2019 with a subsidiary entity,
Constellation Automotive Limited (formerly BBD Bidco Limited) (‘CAL’). CAGL and its subsidiaries are
referred to in this report as the ‘Group’. The Company’s ultimate controlling party is TDR Capital LLP
(‘TDR’), a UK Limited Liability Partnership registered in England and Wales. TDR is a leading international
private equity firm, managing capital on behalf of institutional, government and private investors worldwide.
TDR has an experienced team of investment professionals and operating partners and has a low volume
investment strategy based on principles developed by the investment team over the past decade.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries. The CAGL company
financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group,
and can be found on pages 109 to 114.

The Company’s accounting reference date is 31 March, and its accounts are prepared to a Sunday within
seven days of that date.

**2.** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 March 2021 have been prepared on a going
concern basis in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of
the Companies Act 2006 (IFRSs) and the applicable legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the
revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivatives) at fair value through profit or
loss.

The financial statements and the notes to the financial statements are presented in millions of Pounds Sterling
(‘£’m’) except where otherwise indicated.

Judgements made by the Directors in the application of the accounting policies that have a significant effect
on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial
period are discussed in note 5.

**Going concern**

The Group maintains a mixture of short to medium term debt, committed credit facilities, finance lease
arrangements and cash reserves, which together are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available
funds to finance its operations. The Board reviews forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements based on a
range of scenarios to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient
headroom on its committed borrowing facilities at all times, so that the Group does not breach borrowing
limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

After making appropriate enquiries and having considered the business activities and the Group’s principal
risks and uncertainties, the irectors are satisfied that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

**Basis of consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

_Equity-accounted investments_

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This
is generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Joint ventures are all
entities over which the Group has significant influence and joint control. This is generally the case where the


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**2.** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)**

Group holds 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for under
the equity method, where the Group’s investment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted to
recognise the Group’s share of profit and losses, which are included in the consolidated income statement.
Dividends received are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

Losses applicable to equity-accounted investments are recognised against the carrying value of the investment
only to the extent that the losses do not exceed the carrying value. The Group does not recognise further losses
unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate. Losses applicable to non-controlling
interests are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to
have a deficit balance.

_Intragroup transactions and balances_

Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Gains arising from transactions with jointly
controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Losses are eliminated in the
same way as gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

_Foreign currency_

The functional currency of the Company and the majority of entities within the Group is Pounds Sterling
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. The Group’s
presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of Group entities using
the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of unsettled
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
income statement within finance income or costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in
the income statement within other income or other operating costs.

The exchange rates used for the translation of other currencies in Pounds Sterling that have the most
significant impact on the Group results are shown in note 27.

_Consolidation of Group companies_

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

   - assets and liabilities including goodwill, intangible assets arising on acquisition and fair value
adjustments arising on consolidation for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate
at the date of that balance sheet;

   - income and expenses for each income statement presented are translated at average exchange rates
(unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of
the transactions); and

   - all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated
in the foreign exchange translation reserve or non-controlling interest.

On disposal of a foreign subsidiary the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange translation reserve is recognised in the income
statement when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**(a)** **Revenue**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods and services supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s
activities, as described below.

Vehicle auction revenue represents vendor and buyer fees for vehicles sold by the Group together with fees for
related services including transportation, inspection, valeting and mechanical checks. Revenue is recognised
at the time the service is provided, which is predominantly at the point the vehicle is sold at auction. Revenue
represents the fees for the auction service not the value of the vehicle sold, as the Group does not control the
vehicle before being transferred from vendor to buyer, and does not incur the significant risks and rewards of
ownership as part of the transaction.

In the ordinary course of business at vehicle auctions, in certain circumstances BCA will purchase a vehicle
from a vendor in order to honour a sale where, for example, a buyer has reneged on the purchase or there was
an error in the sales process. The subsequent resale vehicle proceeds are recognised in full as takeover revenue
on the date of resale.

Revenue from outsourced remarketing and other contracts where the Group obtains control and takes legal
title to certain vehicles based on contractual agreements, represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when
the vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Where the Group does not obtain control, revenue
represents the fees for the outsourced remarketing services provided and not the value of the vehicle sold.

Interest and loan origination fees earned in respect of the provision of Partner Finance loans are recognised
over the term of the funding and are included within revenue. ees charged by Partner Finance are recognised
evenly over the period that the relevant service is provided.

Vehicle buying revenue represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised
on the date of sale. Transaction fees charged to customers are recognised on the purchase invoice date and
treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory and therefore in the cost of sales.

Revenue for other services, including logistics and automotive services, is recognised once the contracted
service has been provided. For transportation or delivery services this is deemed to be when the customer has
received the vehicle; for storage services this is deemed to be once an activity has been completed, such as
receiving and parking a vehicle, and generally on a daily basis for storage charges; for vehicle repair and
vehicle enhancement work this is deemed to be when work has been completed to a stage that can be invoiced
to the customer; and for fleet services management this is deemed to be over the period the service is provided
on a straight line basis.

**(b)** **Advertising and marketing costs**

The Group carries out a variety of advertising and marketing activities. These include advertising activities
which correlate to the number of vehicles that are acquired by the Group through the Vehicle Buying division
and for subsequent sale through the Group’s auctions for which revenue is recognised. These direct advertising
costs are therefore recognised as a cost of sale. All other indirect advertising and marketing costs are recognised
within operating costs.

The cost of advertising design is expensed as incurred and the expense of advertising campaigns is expensed
in the income statement in the period in which the advertising space or air time is utilised.

**(c)** **Net finance costs**

_Finance costs_

Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, direct transaction costs, unwinding of the discount
on provisions and lease liabilities, net interest cost of defined benefit pension arrangements and foreign
exchange losses on finance balances. Transaction costs and original issue discount are amortised over the
expected life of the debt using the effective interest method.

_Finance income_

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains on finance
balances. Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest method.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**(d)** **Government grants**

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with any
conditions attaching to them; and that the grants will be received.

The Group recognises income from government grants in the consolidated income statement as a reduction to
the expense which the grants are intended to compensate, and recognises the income as the underlying costs
are incurred.

**(e)** **Income tax**

Income tax for the period presented comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to taxes payable in respect of prior periods.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a
past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits
to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within
the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely
outcome method, in line with the interpretation issued in IFRIC 23.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial
recognition of other assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a
business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are unlikely
to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner and
timing of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention
to settle the balances on a net basis.

**(f)** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months
or less. Bank overdrafts form an integral part of the Group’s cash management and are included as a
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.

**(g)** **Offsetting financial instruments**

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is
a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

**(h)** **Inventories**

Inventories primarily represent vehicles acquired by the Group that have not yet been sold and where the
Group has the risk and reward of ownership of such vehicles. Other inventories include vehicle parts. All
inventories are stated at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenses incurred


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

in bringing each product to its present location and condition. In the Vehicle Buying division the vehicle cost
is net of any administration fees paid to the Group by the seller of the vehicle. Net realisable value is based on
estimated normal selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred on completion of the sale and
disposal.

**(i)** **Financial assets**

_Classification_

The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Management determines the classification of
its financial assets at initial recognition.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that arise
principally through the provision of services to customers. These loans and receivables do not contain a
significant financing component and are initially recognised at the transaction price. hey are included in
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Loans and
receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Impairment provisions are recognised under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the
receivable. The expected credit loss model is calculated using the simplified approach as there is no significant
financing component. This approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised based on an expected
default rate.

For trade receivables, which are reported net of any provisions, such provisions are recorded in a separate
provision account with the loss being recognised within operating costs in the income statement. On
confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off
against the associated provision.

**(j)** **Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

**(k) Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as
a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage
of time is recognised in finance costs.

_Dilapidations_

Provisions for dilapidations are made in respect of property leases on a lease by lease basis and are based on
the Group’s best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. Where relevant, these estimated outflows are
discounted to net present value.

**(l)** **Business combinations**

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred
to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition by acquisition basis at fair value of the


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

**(m) Impairment of non-financial assets**

Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not subject to amortisation. As a result it is tested annually for
impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Other assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for
the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows
(‘cash generating units’), which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of
assets. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible
reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**(n)** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets comprise internally generated software, acquired computer software, and intangible assets
such as customer relationships and brand arising as part of the assessment of assets on the acquisition of a
business. These are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.

Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the
development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 are met. Costs incurred before this point are expensed as
incurred and are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. The assessment identifies unique software
products that are controlled by the Group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs
beyond one year. Salary and related employment costs that are directly attributable to the development of the
software are then capitalised. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in
equal annual amounts over the estimated useful life of the software.

Amortisation and impairment are charged to operating costs in the period in which they arise. Amortisation
is calculated on a straight line basis from the date on which the assets are brought into use, with useful lives as
indicated below:

Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 – 20 years

Brand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 – 25 years

Software–Internally generated . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 10 years

Software–Acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 7 years, or the licence term if shorter

Assets acquired through business combinations are amortised over the remaining useful life at acquisition.

Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. For the Group’s
impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets.

**(o)** **Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and is recognised initially as the excess of the consideration
transferred, over the Group’s interest in fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Goodwill is stated
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units, which are no higher
than an operating segment prior to aggregation, and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.

An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of
goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount. Goodwill that is not denominated in Sterling is retranslated at each
balance sheet date.

**(p)** **Property, plant and equipment**

_Owned assets_

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

the asset to its working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment
have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and
equipment. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Group and when the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised in the income statement.

_Assets under construction_

The costs of assets that are being constructed are capitalised as described in the Owned assets paragraph
above. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is deemed to be available for use. For the
asset to be available for use it has to be in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the intended manner. Once the asset is available for use it is no longer classified as an asset under
construction and is instead depreciated like any other item of property, plant and equipment.

_Depreciation_

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Freehold land and assets under construction are not
depreciated. The rates of depreciation are as follows:

Land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 years or the unexpired lease term if shorter

Fixtures, fittings and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 – 10 years

Plant, machinery and motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 25 years

Assets acquired through business combinations are depreciated over the remaining useful life at acquisition.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. For
the Group’s impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets.

**(q)** **Leases**

_The Group as a lessee_

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. The Group recognises
a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the
lessee, except for short term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low
value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern
in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily
determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position and is
subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the
effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use
asset) whenever:

- the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

- the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the change in lease payments is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

- the lease payments substantially change or other rent concessions are agreed with the lessor during the lease
term.

- a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

The Group elects not to remeasure the lease liability when a significant change or rent concession has occurred
as a direct consequence of the covid-19 pandemic, provided: the revised consideration is substantially the
same as, or less than, the consideration immediately preceding the change, any reduction in lease payments
only affects payments originally due on or before 30 June 2022; and there is no other substantive change to the
lease terms.

The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments
made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on
which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the
lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. The costs are included in the related right of use
asset, unless those costs relate to assets which are accounted for as short term assets.

Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying
asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the
Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of
the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account
for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this
practical expedient. The Group has elected to not apply IFRS 16 to leases of intangibles.

**(q)** **Leases**

_The Group as a lessor_

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its properties. These are classified
as operating leases unless the terms of the lease substantially transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership to
the lessee.

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

**(r)** **Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and original issue discounts incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the
drawdown occurs. Fees and discounts are amortised using the effective interest rate method based on the
expected future cash flows. The impact of changes in expected cash flows are recognised as a profit or loss
within finance costs in the period in which the expectation of future flows change.

**(s)** **Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

**(t)** **Employee benefits**

_Pension obligations_

The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit plans.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not
hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior
periods. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

The defined benefit plans operated by the Group in the United Kingdom are closed to new members. The
costs of providing benefits under the plans are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation
method.

The current service cost is included in operating costs in the consolidated income statement. Past service costs
are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight line basis
over the vesting period. Administrative scheme expenses associated with the plans are recorded within
operating costs when incurred in line with IAS 19. Net interest income or interest cost relating to the funded
defined benefit pension plans is included within finance income or finance costs as relevant in the consolidated
income statement.

Changes to the retirement benefit obligation or asset due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, presented as remeasurements of the
defined benefit scheme in full in the period in which they arise.

Where scheme assets exceed the defined benefit obligation the net asset is only recognised to the extent that an
economic benefit is available to the Group in accordance with the terms of the scheme and where consistent
with relevant statutory requirements.

**(u)** **Share based payments**

The Group operates equity-settled, share based plans. The expense recognised represents the difference
between the fair value of the awards granted and the consideration invested by the recipients. The fair value of
the awards granted is determined by independent valuations.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised with a corresponding increase in retained earnings over
the period during which the relevant employees are expected to become fully entitled to the award (vesting
date).

**5.** **CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements under IFRSs requires the Directors and
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Accounting policies are reviewed annually for
appropriateness. Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical experience
and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, with any changes arising being recognised in the
period in which the change in estimate is made or the final result determined.

Certain of the Group’s significant accounting policies are considered by the Directors to be critical because of
the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the
consolidated financial statements. Unusual or significant transactions in the period that require judgement
are identified in the related note. Existing judgements, where applicable, are contained within the accounting
policies.

Details of the accounting estimates and judgements can be found in the following notes:

**Page** **Estimate** **Judgement**

25 Note 11 Taxation

27 Note 14 Trade and other receivables

29 Note 16 Lease liabilities

**RESULTS FOR THE YEAR**

The following pages provide information about the financial performance for the period on a segmental and
Group basis.

A detailed narrative regarding Group and divisional performance has been provided in the Group operating
review section on pages 6 to 16. The key performance indicators and adjusted EBITDA are presented and
defined in note 6. These are considered key performance indicators because management use these measures
to assess long and short term performance of the Group on a periodic basis.

This section also provides details of the primary operating and finance costs, as well as providing analysis on
employee related information and taxation.

**6.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING**

**Non-GAAP measures**

**Key Performance Indicator—adjusted EBITDA**

Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is
defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) adjusted for
significant or non-recurring items (‘SONR’). The SONR items that are excluded from EBITDA to calculate
adjusted EBITDA are as follows:

- Income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business
closure costs, restructuring costs and share based payment related charges;

- Impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment,
intangibles and goodwill;

- Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition;

- Acquisition expenses and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership.

The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s
activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible
assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and
are not reflective of underlying business performance. Share based payment related charges are excluded as
the initial implementation and ongoing costs are significant or non-recurring and are not reflective of
underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA measures used by other
entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence may not be directly comparable.

All non-GAAP measures are reconciled back to statutory equivalents. They are provided with the clear
intention to aid understanding of performance.

Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of
Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions. Management has identified
that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of
IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

The Board of Directors consider the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK
Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. Group
Costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments.

Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is
therefore not disclosed.

Job Retention Scheme (‘CJRS’) and other equivalent government schemes across Europe. Total grant income
for the year of £35.5m (period 10 June 2019 to 29 March 2020: £1.1m) was recognised as a reduction to wages
and salaries costs and enables the Group to continue the employment of staff who were unable to contribute
to the trading activity of the Group as a result of covid-19 related restrictions.

**Critical accounting estimates—taxation**

Accruals for current tax and amounts payable under local indirect taxes such as sales taxes and VAT are based
on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood that
tax positions taken will be sustained. Management estimates the amount of taxes payable based upon their
analysis and determines whether provision should be made for potential settlement of disputed positions
which are under negotiation. Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the related
tax amount.

**Current tax**

The tax charge for the year/period differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.0%. The
differences are explained below:


**For the**
**year ended**

The Group has operations across Europe, however, the principal location of trading where the majority of
business profits are derived is the UK. The effective tax rate has therefore been referenced to the UK
corporation tax rate of 19.0% for both the current year and prior period.

_Effective tax rate_

The effective tax rate for the period of 39.6% is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK
principally as a result of the following differences:


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**11.** **TAXATION (continued)**

- Group relief purchased for lower payment than 19.0% applied to losses surrendered; and

- Non-taxable foreign exchange gains arising on the Group’s external Euro borrowings.

On 3 March 2021 it was announced that the UK’s main rate of corporation tax is due to increase from 19% to
25% from 1 April 2023. The increase in the rate was not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and
therefore is not reflected in the tax charge for the year. The future increase in the tax rate would result in an
additional deferred tax charge of approximately £39.0m in the year of enactment.

The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. Where points
are investigated, the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds a provision in
respect of the potential tax liability which may arise. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised
when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable
that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are
assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are
measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely outcome method, in line with the interpretation
issued in IFRIC 23. There are no provisions that are individually or collectively material.

**Deferred tax**

**Critical accounting estimates—deferred tax**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent management’s best estimate in determining the amounts to be
recognised. When assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, consideration is
given to the timing and level of future taxable income.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of interest deductions restricted in the current period
under the UK’s corporate interest restriction (CI ) regulations to the extent that it offsets against deferred tax
liabilities created in the accounting for business combinations.

Deferred tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to
settle the balance on a net basis.

_Deferred tax on losses not recognised_

As at 28 March 2021 a deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of £4.2m has not been recognised (2020:
£4.2m). Due to the nature of the losses and resulting restrictions on their use it is not expected that the asset
will reverse in future periods based on current forecasts.

**WORKING CAPITAL AND PROVISIONS**

This section details the assets and liabilities that are directly generated through the Group’s trading activities.
This includes cash and cash equivalents, inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables.
It also includes provisions, commitments and contingencies.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**11.** **TAXATION (continued)**

In respect of the Vehicle Remarketing divisions, trade receivables includes the gross auction proceeds due
from buyers, regardless of whether the vehicle was owned by the Group. Gross auction proceeds represent the
full value of the vehicles sold, not just the fees recognised in the income statement. Correspondingly, trade
payables also includes the auction proceeds due to external vendors of vehicles.

Inventories includes vehicles only where the Group holds the risk and rewards of ownership, as detailed in
accounting policy (h). This mainly relates to the Vehicle Buying division and outsourced remarketing contracts
with the UK Vehicle Remarketing division.

The Group has a legal right of offset over specified bank accounts but does not intend to settle these balances
on a net basis, and therefore has presented cash and cash equivalents gross of overdrafts at the balance sheet
date.

**Critical accounting estimates—trade and other receivables**

Loss allowances for trade receivables due from customers under Partner Finance arrangements are recognised
under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the receivable. Management are required to
develop estimates of credit risk using the best available information about past events, current conditions and
forecasts of economic conditions. Partner Finance receivables are asset backed, providing a level of protection
based on the value and recovery of the asset. Management apply judgement in assessing whether there is a
significant change in credit risk which would impact the expected credit loss allowance recognised.

The creation and release of loss allowances on trade receivables in the period has been included in operating
costs in the income statement.

**16.** **LEASE LIABILITIES**

**Critical accounting estimates—leases**

Management use a lease specific incremental borrowing rate to discount the future lease liabilities, where the
interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available. Using an incremental borrowing rate requires
management to estimate the rate of interest that would be paid to borrow over a similar term, and with similar
security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic
environment.

The Group leases various properties and other assets under lease agreements. The leases have varying terms,
including escalation clauses, renewal rights and purchase options. None of these terms represent unusual
arrangements.

Capital commitments at 28 March 2021 were £10.7m (2020: £7.7m).

**Contingencies**

At any point in time the Company and its subsidiaries may be party to various legal proceedings, some of
which may involve claims for damages. The outcome of such proceedings cannot be readily foreseen.
Management believes that there are no disputes with any third parties that would result in a material liability
for the Group.

**LONG TERM ASSETS**

This section outlines the acquisitions made by the Group in the period, as well as the tangible and intangible
assets held by the Group.

Tangible assets include the physical assets which are used by the Group in the course of business which
generate, or contribute to the generation of, revenue and profit. Tangible assets include the property, plant
and equipment owned by the Group as well as right of use assets available to the Group through lease
arrangements. These assets include property and property improvements used by our divisions, equipment
used by our employees, and our fleet of transporters and other motor vehicles.

Intangible assets are non-physical assets which contribute to, or generate, revenue and profit. These assets
include goodwill, customer relationships and brands, acquired through business combinations. This also
includes software, which can be purchased, acquired through business combinations, or generated internally
based on bespoke requirements and demands in the business. This includes a comprehensive suite of digital
tools which are used by internal and external stakeholders to facilitate and coordinate our business activities.

**18.** **ACQUISITIONS**

**Critical accounting judgements—acquisition accounting**

For all acquisitions in the period, management are required to apply judgement to determine the business
combination accounting, and in relation to the identification of separable assets and liabilities arising on
acquisition.

**Critical accounting estimates—acquisition accounting**

Management make estimates of future cash flows to value the assets and make estimates in determining the
useful economic life of intangible assets.

_Equity-accounted investment—Centre De Rénovation De Véhicules D’Occasion Ingrandes_

During May 2020 the Group acquired a 50% holding in Centre De Rénovation De Véhicules D’Occasion
Ingrandes (CRVO) for total consideration of £0.4m. The Group provided a further capital injection of £1.4m
in September 2020. This investment has been identified as a joint venture because the joint venture agreement
requires unanimous consent from all parties for all relevant activities. The two partners have direct rights to
the net assets of the partnership. As a result the investment in joint venture has been accounted for using the
equity method. The Group has recognised a £1.0m loss for its share of the result between acquisition and 28
March 2021. This loss has been recognised against the carrying value of the investment held. Further details
are provided in note 31.

_Equity-accounted investment—Automotion Events Limited_

During July 2020 the Group acquired a 30% holding in Automotion Events Limited for total consideration of
£0.2m. This investment has been identified as an associate because the Group has significant influence but
not control of Automotion Events. As a result the investment in associate has been accounted for using the
equity method.

The investment was subsequently sold in September 2020 as disclosed in note 19. The Group’s share of the
result for the period between acquisition and the date of disposal was £nil.

_Prior year acquisition of BCA Marketplace plc_

On 6 November 2019 the Group acquired 100% of the Ordinary shares of BCA Marketplace plc (‘BCAM’),
a leading operator in the automotive industry with shares traded on the London Stock Exchange as a
constituent of the UK’s FTSE 250.

The total outstanding BCAM share capital was acquired by Constellation Automotive Limited (formerly
BBD Bidco Limited), a subsidiary of the Group, for cash consideration of £2.3635 per share. The acquisition


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**18.** **ACQUISITIONS (continued)**

was completed through a Court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act
2006. Following the acquisition, BCAM re-registered from a public company to a private limited company.

This resulted in the acquisition of a number of identified intangible assets including existing brands and
customer relationships and goodwill arising due to the unique position that BCAM had in the automotive
sector, including the value of the geographical presence and assembled workforce in place, significant barriers
to entry for competitors, and access to significant automotive market data and knowledge.

The acquisition also included the identification of fair value adjustments on certain assets and liabilities
acquired, and remaining assets and liabilities that were acquired at book value.

The fair value of acquired trade and other receivables was £175.7m. The gross contractual amounts receivable
of £179.7m at the acquisition date included £4.0m of contractual cash flows that were not expected to be
received.

Due to the material nature of the acquisition by an otherwise dormant Group, the entire revenue and adjusted
EBITDA of the Group for the period 6 November 2019 to 29 March 2020 represented the results of the
acquisition. Had the acquisition been effective from incorporation of the Company, estimated revenue for the
same period would have been £2,850.0m. It was not possible to estimate the profit for the period since
incorporation due to the significant impact of financing arrangements on the Group’s profits.

There have been no changes to the assessed fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities during the period
30 March 2020 to 28 March 2021.

_Prior year equity-accounted investment—Proov Station S.A.S_

During February 2020 the Group acquired a 22.02% holding in Proov Station, an automated service
inspection provider, for total consideration of £1.8m. This investment was identified as an associate because

the Group has significant influence but not control of Proov Station. As a result the investment in associate
has been accounted for using the equity method. Further details are provided in note 31.

**19.** **DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

On 18 September 2020 the Group transferred Cinch Sub Holdco UK Limited and its subsidiaries to a

**Critical accounting estimates—impairment of goodwill and intangible assets**

An impairment review has been conducted on all goodwill and intangible assets held by the Group. The
impairment review is performed on a value in use basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash
flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth
rate. Specifically, the future cash flows are sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth,
EBITDA margin and the long term growth rate of the relevant market. Given the degree of subjectivity
involved, actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating unit (‘CGU’) or group of
CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination. These CGU
groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for
management purposes. Goodwill is monitored by management at an operating segment level and has been
allocated to operating segments as follows:

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired,
by comparing the carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amounts, which is derived from a
value in use calculation. Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the assets, the assets
are considered as not impaired.

Cash flow forecasts use the budget, future Strategic plan forecasts and future growth rates. These form the
basis of the cash flow projections for each CGU, and are the basis for the remaining forecast financial years.
The forecast reflects management’s expectations of the medium term operating performance of each CGU
and growth prospects in the CGU’s markets and regions, and are based on the Strategic plan.

Other key assumptions in the value in use calculation are shown below:

**Vehicle Remarketing**

**Automotive**
**UK** **International** **Vehicle Buying** **Services**

Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period . . . . . 2.0% 2.0% 1.6% 1.8%

Pre-tax discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.3% 13.4% 16.6% 10.7%

Growth rates used do not exceed expectations of long term growth in the local market.

The discount rate is estimated by the Group using a range of equity costs for similar companies and external
market data, with samples chosen where applicable from the same markets or territories as the CGU.

The assumptions applied in the calculation of value in use for goodwill have been sensitised as follows:

- 10% reduction to long term operating cash flow

- 0.25% increase in discount rate

The Directors have reviewed the key assumptions used in the impairment calculations and have considered
the impact of reasonably possible changes in these assumptions, including those sensitivities identified above.
Based on this review, the Directors have identified that these reasonably likely changes could give rise to a
material change to the recoverable amount of the assets, but would not give rise to an impairment.

_Software impairment_

During the year, the Group recognised an impairment charge in operating costs of £0.7m. This was recognised
in full in Vehicle Remarketing UK. The cash generating unit is a reportable segment as defined in IFRS 8.

The impairment charge represents the total carrying value for a specific piece of software for which the Group
no longer expects to receive any future benefit.

**CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**

This section details the Group’s capital structure, financing and any associated distributions. This includes
amounts available and utilised in the form of external borrowings. Partner Finance borrowings and lease
liabilities are asset-backed facilities and are therefore presented separately to bank borrowings.

The Group utilises a combination of shareholder equity, bank loans and flexible revolving facilities to manage
the Group’s capital and liquidity requirements, to meet strategic objectives and fund investment opportunities.
This section also includes the capital transactions which have occurred during the period.

**23.** **BANK BORROWINGS (continued)**

In November 2019 the Group refinanced, putting in place a Senior Term facilities agreement and a Second
Lien facility. The Senior facilities agreement comprises Facility B1 £525.0m, Facility B2 €534.5m and a
£155.0m revolving facility. The Second Lien facility comprises Facility F1 £265.0m.

The term facilities were drawn down in full at inception. The facilities were net of arrangement fees of £25.3m
and original issue discount of £6.4m. During the year the Senior Facilities greement was amended to extend
the suspension of certain covenant testing until the quarter ending March 2022.

In April 2020 the Group put in place an additional Senior Liquidity Facility, which ranks pari passu with the
existing facilities. This facility comprises a Senior Liquidity Facility €67.0m.

This facility was drawn down in full during the period and remained drawn down at the period end. The
facility was drawn net of arrangement fees and original issue discount of £3.1m.

Carrying amounts are stated net of unamortised transaction costs and original issue discount. The transaction
costs, together with the interest expense and original issue discount, are being allocated to the income
statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying amount. The fair value of bank
borrowings is equal to the nominal value of the bank loan.

At 28 March 2021, the Group had issued letters of credit in the ordinary course of business of £4.3m (2020:
£4.3m), had drawn down £40.0m (2020: £115.0m) on the revolving facility and had not utilised the net
overdraft (2020: £33.4m), leaving the following as undrawn borrowing facilities:

The Group has an asset-backed finance facility of £220.0m to fund the Partner Finance business. The amount
is advanced solely to a Partner Finance subsidiary in respect of specific receivables. Interest is charged on the
drawn down element of the facility at a variable rate of interest, based on the Bank of England base rate. At
28 March 2021 the borrowings were £148.3m (2020: £159.4m).

**PENSIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**26.** **PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS**

The Group participates in several defined contribution schemes and two defined benefit schemes (‘the BCA
Pension Plan’ within British Car Auctions Limited and ‘the Automotive Plan’ within Walon Limited).

The BCA Pension Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. The plan is closed to new members.
The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out as of 5
April 2020 and updated to the period end date by Capita, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance
with IAS 19.

The Automotive Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. The plan closed to future accrual
from 1997. The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out
as of 5 April 2019 and updated to the period end date by Mercer, independent consulting actuaries, in
accordance with IAS 19.

The defined benefit plans are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework
published by the UK pensions regulator. Benefits are paid to the members from a separate fund administered
by independent trustees. The BCA Pension Plan has five trustees, three of whom are appointed by the Group
and two chosen by scheme members. The Automotive Plan has four trustees, two of whom are appointed by
the Group and two chosen by scheme members. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the
members and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.

**Critical accounting estimates—pensions**

The Group’s net retirement benefit obligation, which is reviewed by management using assessments from
independent actuaries each period, is based on key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation, future
salary increases and pension costs. These assumptions may be different to the actual outcome.

The principal assumptions used for the BCA Pension Plan and the Automotive Plan are as follows:

**Risk management**

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as mortality risk, interest rate risk and
market investment risk. The investment policies of each scheme are described below:

_Asset volatility. . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated
on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to
corporate bond yields. If the plan assets under perform this yield, then
this will create a deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisers,
carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and
consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies.
Currently the plans hold approximately 35% of assets as defensive assets
(government and corporate bonds) with the intention of mitigating
significant changes in yields. As each plan matures, the level of
investment risk is reduced by investing more in governmentand
corporate bonds that better match the liabilities. However, the Group
believes that due tothe long term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level
of continuing equity investment is anappropriate element of the long
term investment strategy. In respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pension
(‘GMP’) obligations, the strategy has the objectivesof achieving an
overall rate of return that is sufficient to meet pensioners’ reason able
expectations, reduce investment return volatility over the short term
period to retirement where this is possible and to invest in assets that are
liquid such that they enable switching between asset classes. In order to
achieve these objectives, the strategy is to invest in a mixture of on-risk
assets (including equities) and off-risk assets (including bonds, gilts and
cash), with the proportionate allocation of the latter increasing
according to an agreed profile as members approach their normal
retirement date.

_Inflation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’ pension liabilities in deferment are linked to inflation. Higher
inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases
there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to
pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation.
The BCA Pension Plan holds approximately 5% of the plans’ assets in
index-linked bonds (including government bonds) to partially hedge
against this risk. The remainder of the plans’ assets are either unaffected
by or loosely correlated with inflation, and so an increase in inflation
can lead to an increase in the plan deficit.

_Mortality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’obligation is to provide a pension for the life of their members,
so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the
plans’ benefit payments. Whilst future mortality rates cannot be
predicted with certainty the plans adopt up to date mortality
assumptions and review the overall risk as part of the triennial actuarial
valuations.
_Bond yields . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ Plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest
rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a
decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans. This risk is
partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to
bond yields. An increase in interest rates has the effect of increasing bond
yields, which in turn decreases plan liabilities. If interest rates decrease
the opposite is true for both plan liabilities and assets.
_Salary changes . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The calculation of the BCA Pension Plan liabilities uses the future
estimated salaries of plan participants. Increases in the salary of plan
participants above that assumed will increase the plan liabilities. The
Automotive Plan is closed to future accruals, so is not exposed to this
risk.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used. The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of
the defined benefit obligations to changes in the significant assumptions used for the schemes.

Impact on the defined benefit obligations:

**BCA** **Automotive** **BCA** **Automotive**

**% of** **% of**
**£’m** **£’m** **liability** **liability**

Discount rate: +0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (3.8) (0.7) (4.1)% (4.2)%
Inflation and related assumptions: +0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.8 — 2.0% (0.1)%
Mortality: reduced by 10% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0 n/a 3.3% n/a
Mortality: increase in life expectancy of 1 year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . n/a (0.6) n/a (3.2)%

The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, and
in practice this is unlikely to occur. The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably
possible fluctuations.

**Expected future cash flows**

The Group expects the employer contributions to be made to its defined benefit plans in the 2021/22 financial
year to be £2.4m. The Group’s management do not expect any material changes to the annual cash
contributions over the next three years; however it keeps contributions under review in the light of movements
in the funding position of the schemes.

The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to
members over the next several decades. The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 17 years for
both the BCA Pension Plan and the Automotive Plan.

**Financial risk management**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk
and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of risk
management is carried out by the Board.

**Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices (principally exchange rates and interest rates) will affect
the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

**Foreign exchange risk**

The Group operates in the UK and continental Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland) and is therefore exposed to foreign
exchange risk. Foreign exchange risk arises primarily on recognised assets and liabilities and net investments
in foreign operations. These overseas operations’ revenues and costs are mainly denominated in the currencies
of the countries in which the operations are located. The most significant of these is the Euro. The Euro to
Sterling exchange rates used by the Group are shown below:

The functional currencies of the revenue and adjusted EBITDA of the Group’s operations are as follows:

**For the period ended 28 March 2021** **For the period ended 29 March 2020**

**GBP** **Euro** **Other** **Total** **GBP** **Euro** **Other** **Total**

Revenue (£’m) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,082.4 340.5 31.1 3,454.0 1,330.4 115.2 15.0 1,460.6

Adjusted EBITDA (%) . . . . . . . . . 81.5% 19.2% (0.7%) 100.0% 82.0% 16.2% 1.8% 100.0%

The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures. The Group monitors
its exposure to currency fluctuations on an ongoing basis. The Group maintains part of its debt in Euro to
reflect the currency in which its EBITDA is generated.

The Group has not hedged profit translation exposures. During the year and as at 28 March 2021 the Group
did not have any hedges in place.

For the year ended 28 March 2021, if Sterling had strengthened by 10% on average against the Euro with all
other variables held constant, adjusted EBITDA for the year would have been £3.8m lower (2020: £1.3m
lower) as a result of a reduction of the equivalent value in Sterling of profits denominated in Euros.

Details of the currencies in which the Group’s cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and
loans and overdrafts are denominated are set out below:

**For the year ended 28 March 2021** **For the year ended 29 March 2020**

**Interest rate risk**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the Group’s borrowings as disclosed in note 23. Interest rates have
been historically low and stable in terms of both LIBOR and EURIBOR rates and consequently no structured
hedging has been implemented in the current period. The Group will continue to monitor interest rates and
assess the requirement for hedging in the future. All of the Group’s finance leases are at fixed rates of interest.

For the year ended 28 March 2021, if the average rate on floating rate borrowings had been 50 basis points
higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the period would have been £5.7m lower
(2020: £6.6m lower).

**Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss in the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally through trade receivables from customers and
cash balances.

The Group has policies in place to ensure that services are only provided to clients with an appropriate credit
history.

Customers who have an account with BCA Partner Finance are able to finance vehicles acquired through UK
Vehicle Remarketing. Prior to opening an account and subsequently, a credit assessment is completed and
appropriate security is obtained. In addition, legal title of the vehicle remains with the Group until the
outstanding balance is settled in full.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**27.** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS–RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)**

Cash and cash equivalents are held with reputable institutions. The cash required for working capital is held
with reputable banks in each country of operation as appropriate. All other material cash balances are
deposited with financial institutions whose credit rating is at least Standard and Poor’s A- or equivalent.

**Liquidity risks**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group Finance.
Group Finance monitors forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to
meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities
at all times so that the Group minimises the risk of breaching borrowing limits or covenants on any of its
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plan and covenant
compliance requirements on its borrowings.

The Group has a £155.0m revolving facility. At 28 March 2021 £40.0m (2020: £115.0m) of the facility had
been drawn and £4.3m (2020: £4.3m) of the facility having been utilised to provide guarantees to third parties.
This revolving facility is considered by management to provide adequate flexibility given the current liquidity
of the business.

The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based
on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in
the tables below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows:

**Capital risk management**

The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base (which comprises share capital, reserves and debt) so as
to maintain stakeholder confidence and to sustain future development of the business. This includes
consideration of the Group’s debt financing plan and covenant compliance requirements on its borrowings.

**Fair value**

The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their carrying value.

**28.** **SHARE BASED PAYMENTS**

Under the terms of a Management Investment Plan (‘MIP’) agreement, certain senior executives of the
Company acquired shares in Constellation Automotive Holdings Sarl (‘CAH’), an intermediate parent of the


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**28.** **SHARE BASED PAYMENTS (continued)**

Company. The shares issued under the MIP are designed to incentivise the holders to grow the equity value of
the group headed by CAH (the ‘Constellation Holdings Group’) at all times while in its employment.

During the year, 172,900 shares were subscribed for under the terms of the MIP, representing 2.1% of the
issued ordinary share capital of CAH. The shares are split such that each participant holds equal numbers of
A ordinary shares and Sweet Equity. These shares remain in issue at the period end and are held on trust by a
nominee (the ‘Nominee’). BBD Topco Sarl (‘BBD Topco’) and a co-investor hold the remaining shares in
CAH. Total expenses arising from share-based payment transactions recognised during the year were £1.0m.

In addition to rights to dividends, the MIP shares entitle the holders to investment returns determined as
follows:

   - Upon an Exit event (including a sale of CAH, a sale of its assets, its winding up or an IPO of its shares)
and after payment of amounts due in relation to any debt securities in issue at the time:

—The Sweet Equity shares entitle the holders to a priority return based upon an investment multiple
(the ‘MIP Multiple’). The MIP multiple comprises a ratcheted return subject to a minimum
internal rate of return achieved by BBD Topco on its investment in CAH. The MIP Multiple
achievable ranges between one and three times the investment multiple achieved by BBD opco
and is applied to the total amount invested by holders in both A shares and Sweet Equity. The
amount payable on Sweet Equity shares is after deduction of the amount payable on A shares.

—The A shares entitle the holders to an equal return, on a pro-rata basis, to that of BBD Topco and
the co-investor.

  - Upon leaving the employment of the Constellation Holdings Group and BBD Topco exercising its
entitlement to require the holder to transfer their MIP shares to the Nominee:

—The A shares entitle the holder to the market value of those shares (as determined at the time).

—The Sweet Equity shares entitle the holder to a return dependent upon whether they leave the
Constellation Holdings Group:

   - As a designated 'good leaver’—in which case they will receive a return representing the higher of cost
and market value

   - As a designated 'bad leaver'—in which case they will receive a return representing the lower of cost and
market value

   - As a designated 'intermediate leaver'—in which case they will receive a return referenced to the period
over which the MIP shares where held, the maximum entitlement being full market value where the
MIP shares were held for 5 years or more.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

**TO THE MEMBERS OF BBD PARENTCO LIMITED**

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Opinion**

In our opinion, BBD Parentco Limited’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the
‘financial statements’):

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 29 March 2020 and
of the Group’s loss and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the period (the ‘period’) then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the company’s financial statements, as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual
Report’), which comprise: the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 29 March 2020; the consolidated
income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company cash
flow statements, and the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the period then ended;
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for
the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to
report to you where:

- the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is
not appropriate; or

- the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the group’s and company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis
of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to
the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express
an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance
thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we


-----

identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of
the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based
on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’report, we also considered whether the disclosures required
by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK)
require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

_Strategic Report and Directors’ report_

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic
Report and Directors’ report for the period ended 29 March 2020 is consistent with the financial statements
and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’
report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_

As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 47, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in
writing.


-----

**OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING**

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

BBD Parentco Limited (‘Parentco’, the ‘Company’) was incorporated as a UK private company limited by
shares on 10 June 2019 with a subsidiary entity, BBD Bidco Limited (‘Bidco’). No comparative is presented as
this is the first accounting period. Parentco and its subsidiaries are referred to in this report as the ‘Group’.
The Company’s ultimate controlling party is TDR Capital LLP (‘TDR’), a UK Limited Liability Partnership
registered in England and Wales. TDR is a leading international private equity firm, managing capital on
behalf of institutional, government and private investors worldwide. TDR has an experienced team of
investment professionals and operating partners and has a low volume investment strategy based on principles
developed by the investment team over the past decade.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Parentco company
financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group,
and can be found on pages 100 to 105.

Following the acquisition of the BCA group, the Company changed its accounting reference date to 31 March
and its accounts are prepared to a Sunday within seven days of that date.

**2.** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

These consolidated financial statements for the period ended 29 March 2020 have been prepared on a going
concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRS
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations as adopted by the European Union (‘Adopted IFRS’)
and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the
revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivatives) at fair value through profit or
loss.

The financial statements and the notes to the financial statements are presented in millions of Pounds Sterling
(‘£m’) except where otherwise indicated.

Judgements made by the Directors in the application of the accounting policies that have a significant effect
on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial
period are discussed in note 5.

**Going concern**

The Group maintains a mixture of short to medium term debt, committed credit facilities, finance lease
arrangements and cash reserves, which together are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available
funds to finance its operations. The Board reviews forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements based on a
range of scenarios to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operations needs while maintaining sufficient
headroom on its committed borrowing facilities at all times, so that the Group does not breach borrowing
limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

After making appropriate enquiries and having considered the business activities and the Group’s principal
risks and uncertainties, the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

**Basis of consolidation**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This
is generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in
associates are accounted for under the equity method, where the Group’s investment is initially recognised at
cost and subsequently adjusted to recognise the Group’s share of profit and losses, which are included in the
consolidated income statement. Dividends received are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of
the investment.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**2.** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)**

Losses applicable to equity-accounted investments are recognised against the carrying value of the investment
only to the extent that the losses do not exceed the carrying value. The Group does not recognise further losses
unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate. Losses applicable to non-controlling
interests are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to
have a deficit balance.

Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Gains arising from transactions with jointly
controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Losses are eliminated in the
same way as gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

The functional currency of the Company and the majority of entities within the Group is Pounds Sterling
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. The Group’s
presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.

_Transactions and balances_

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of Group entities using
the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of unsettled
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
income statement within finance income or costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in
the income statement within other income or other operating costs.

_Consolidation of Group companies_

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities including goodwill, intangible assets arising on acquisition and fair value adjustments
arising on consolidation for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of
that balance sheet;

- income and expenses for each income statement presented are translated at average exchange rates (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the
transactions); and

- all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the
foreign exchange translation reserve or non-controlling interest.

On disposal of a foreign subsidiary the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange translation reserve is recognised in the income
statement when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

The exchange rates used for the translation of other currencies in Pounds Sterling that have the most
significant impact on the Group results are shown in note 26.

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**(a)** **Revenue**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods and services supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group
recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s
activities, as described below.

Vehicle auction revenue represents vendor and buyer fees for vehicles sold by the Group together with fees for
related services including transportation, inspection, valeting and mechanical checks. Revenue is recognised
at the time the service is provided, which is predominantly at the point the vehicle is sold at auction. Revenue
represents the fees for the auction service not the value of the vehicle sold, as the Group does not control the
vehicle before being transferred from vendor to buyer, and does not incur the significant risks and rewards of
ownership as part of the transaction.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

In the ordinary course of business at vehicle auctions, in certain circumstances BCA will purchase a vehicle
from a vendor in order to honour a sale where, for example, a buyer has reneged on the purchase or there was
an error in the sales process. The subsequent resale vehicle proceeds are recognised in full as takeover revenue
on the date of resale.

Revenue from outsourced remarketing contracts, where the Group obtains control and takes legal title to
certain vehicles based on contractual agreements, represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the
vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Where the Group does not obtain control, revenue
represents the fees for the outsourced remarketing services provided and not the value of the vehicle sold.

Interest and loan origination fees earned in respect of the provision of Partner Finance loans are recognised
over the term of the funding and are included within revenue. Fees charged by Partner Finance are recognised
evenly over the period that the relevant service is provided.

Vehicle buying revenue represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised
on the date of sale. Transaction fees charged to customers are recognised on the purchase invoice date and
treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory and therefore in the cost of sales.

Revenue for other services, including logistics and automotive services, is recognised once the contracted
service has been provided. For transportation or delivery services this is deemed to be when the customer has
received the vehicle; for storage services this is deemed to be once an activity has been completed, such as
receiving and parking a vehicle, and generally on a daily basis for storage charges; for vehicle repair and
vehicle enhancement work this is deemed to be when work has been completed to a stage that can be invoiced
to the customer; and for fleet services management this is deemed to be over the period the service is provided
on a straight line basis.

**(b)** **Advertising and marketing costs**

The Group carries out a variety of advertising and marketing activities. These include advertising activities
which correlate to the number of vehicles that are acquired by the Group through the Vehicle Buying division
and for subsequent sale through the Group’s auctions for which revenue is recognised. These direct advertising
costs are therefore recognised as a cost of sale. All other indirect advertising and marketing costs are recognised
within operating costs.

The cost of advertising design is expensed as incurred and the expense of advertising campaigns is expensed
in the income statement in the period in which the advertising space or air time is utilised.

**(c)** **Net finance costs**

_Finance costs_

Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, direct transaction costs, unwinding of the discount
on provisions and lease liabilities, net interest cost of defined benefit pension arrangements and foreign
exchange losses on finance balances. Transaction costs and original issue discount are amortised over the
expected life of the debt using the effective interest method.

_Finance income_

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains on finance
balances. Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest method.

**(d)** **Government grants**

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with any
conditions attaching to them; and that the grants will be received.

The Group recognises income from government grants in the consolidated income statement as a reduction to
the expense which the grants are intended to compensate, and recognises the income as the underlying costs
are incurred.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**(e)** **Income tax**

Income tax for the period presented comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to taxes payable in respect of prior periods.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a
past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits
to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within
the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely
outcome method, in line with the interpretation issued in IFRIC 23.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial
recognition of other assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a
business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are unlikely
to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner and
timing of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention
to settle the balances on a net basis.

**(f)** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months
or less. Bank overdrafts form an integral part of the Group’s cash management and are included as a
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.

**(g)** **Offsetting financial instruments**

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is
a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

**(h)** **Inventories**

Inventories primarily represent vehicles acquired by the Group that have not yet been sold and where the
Group has the risk and reward of ownership of such vehicles. Other inventories include vehicle parts. All
inventories are stated at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenses incurred
in bringing each product to its present location and condition. In the Vehicle Buying division the vehicle cost
is net of any administration fees paid to the Group by the seller of the vehicle. Net realisable value is based on
estimated normal selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred on completion of the sale and
disposal.

**(i)** **Financial assets**

_Classification_

The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Management determines the classification of
its financial assets at initial recognition.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that arise
principally through the provision of services to customers. These loans and receivables do not contain a
significant financing component and are initially recognised at the transaction price. They are included in
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Loans and
receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Impairment provisions are recognised under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the
receivable. The expected credit loss model is calculated using the simplified approach as there is no significant
financing component. This approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised based on an expected
default rate.

For trade receivables, which are reported net of any provisions, such provisions are recorded in a separate
provision account with the loss being recognised within operating costs in the income statement. On
confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off
against the associated provision.

**(j)** **Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

**(k) Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as
a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage
of time is recognised in finance costs.

_Dilapidations_

Provisions for dilapidations are made in respect of property leases on a lease by lease basis and are based on
the Group’s best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. Where relevant, these estimated outflows are
discounted to net present value.

**(l)** **Business combinations**

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred
to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition by acquisition basis at fair value of the
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

**(m) Impairment of non-financial assets**

Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not subject to amortisation. As a result it is tested annually for
impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Other assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for
the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows
(‘cash generating units’), which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of
assets. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible
reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**(n)** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets comprise internally generated software, acquired computer software, and intangible assets
such as customer relationships and brand arising as part of the assessment of assets on the acquisition of a
business. These are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.

Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the
development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 are met. Costs incurred before this point are expensed as
incurred and are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. The assessment identifies unique software
products that are controlled by the Group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs
beyond one year. Salary and related employment costs that are directly attributable to the development of the
software are then capitalised. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in
equal annual amounts over the estimated useful life of the software.

Amortisation and impairment are charged to operating costs in the period in which they arise. Amortisation
is calculated on a straight line basis from the date on which the assets are brought into use, with useful lives as
indicated below:

Customer relationships. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12–20 years

Brand. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15–25 years

Software–Internally generated. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3–10 years

Software–Acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3–7 years, or the licence term if shorter

Assets acquired through business combinations are amortised over the remaining useful life at acquisition.

Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. For the Group’s
impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets.

**(o)** **Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and is recognised initially as the excess of the consideration
transferred, over the Group’s interest in fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Goodwill is stated
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units, which are no higher
than an operating segment prior to aggregation, and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.

An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of
goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount. Goodwill that is not denominated in Sterling is retranslated at each
balance sheet date.

**(p)** **Property, plant and equipment**

_Owned assets_

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing
the asset to its working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment
have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and
equipment. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Group and when the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised in the income statement.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

_Assets under construction_

The costs of assets that are being constructed are capitalised as described in the Owned assets paragraph
above. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is deemed to be available for use. For the
asset to be available for use it has to be in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the intended manner. Once the asset is available for use it is no longer classified as an asset under
construction and is instead depreciated like any other item of property, plant and equipment.

_Depreciation_

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Freehold land and assets under construction are not
depreciated. The rates of depreciation are as follows:

Land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2–10 years
Plant, machinery and motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . 3–25 years

Assets acquired through business combinations are depreciated over the remaining useful life at acquisition.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. For
the Group’s impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets.

**(q)** **Leases**

_The Group as a lessee_

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. The Group recognises
a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the
lessee, except for short term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low
value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern
in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily
determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position and is
subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the
effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use
asset) whenever:

- the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

- the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).

- the lease payments substantially change or other rent concessions are agreed with the lessor during the lease
term.

- a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments
made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on
which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the
lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. The costs are included in the related right of use
asset, unless those costs relate to assets which are accounted for as short term assets.

Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying
asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the
Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of
the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account
for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this
practical expedient. The Group has elected to not apply IFRS 16 to leases of intangibles.

_The Group as a lessor_

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its properties. These are classified
as operating leases unless the terms of the lease substantially transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership to
the lessee.

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

**(r)** **Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and original issue discounts incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the
drawdown occurs. Fees and discounts are amortised using the effective interest rate method based on the
expected future cash flows. The impact of changes in expected cash flows are recognised as a profit or loss
within finance costs in the period in which the expectation of future flows change.

**(s)** **Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

**(t)** **Employee benefits**

_Pension obligations_

The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit plans.

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not
hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior
periods. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

The defined benefit plans operated by the Group in the United Kingdom are closed to new members. The
costs of providing benefits under the plans are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation
method.

The current service cost is included in operating costs in the consolidated income statement. Past service costs
are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight line basis
over the vesting period. Administrative scheme expenses associated with the plans are recorded within
operating costs when incurred in line with IAS 19. Net interest income or interest cost relating to the funded
defined benefit pension plans is included within finance income or finance costs as relevant in the consolidated
income statement.


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**4.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Changes to the retirement benefit obligation or asset due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, presented as remeasurements of the
defined benefit scheme in full in the period in which they arise.

Where scheme assets exceed the defined benefit obligation the net asset is only recognised to the extent that an
economic benefit is available to the Group in accordance with the terms of the scheme and where consistent
with relevant statutory requirements.

**5.** **CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements under Adopted IFRS requires the Directors
and management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Accounting policies are reviewed annually
for appropriateness. Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical experience
and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, with any changes arising being recognised in the
period in which the change in estimate is made or the final result determined.

Certain of the Group’s significant accounting policies are considered by the Directors to be critical because of
the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the
consolidated financial statements. Unusual or significant transactions in the period that require judgement
are identified in the related note. Existing judgements, where applicable, are contained within the accounting
policies.

Details of the accounting estimates and judgements can be found in the following notes:

**Page** **Estimate** **Judgement**

76 Note 11 Taxation

79 Note 14 Trade and other receivables

80 Note 16 Lease liabilities

81 Note 18 Acquisitions

83 Note 19 Intangible assets

87 Note 25 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

**RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD**

The following pages provide information about the financial performance for the period on a segmental and
Group basis.

A detailed narrative regarding Group and divisional performance has been provided in the Group operating
review section on pages 6 to 13. The key performance indicators and adjusted EBITDA are presented and
defined in note 6. These are considered key performance indicators because management use these measures
to assess long and short term performance of the Group on a periodic basis.

This section also provides details of the primary operating and finance costs, as well as providing analysis on
employee related information and taxation.

**6.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING**

**Non-GAAP measures**

**Key Performance Indicator—adjusted EBITDA**

Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is
defined as Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) adjusted for
significant or non-recurring items (‘SONR’). The SONR items that are excluded from EBITDA to calculate
adjusted EBITDA are as follows:

- Income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business
closure costs and restructuring costs;


-----

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**6.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING (continued)**

- Impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment,
intangibles and goodwill;

- Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition;

- Acquisition expenses and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership.

The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s
activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible
assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and
are not reflective of underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA
measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence may not be directly
comparable.

All non-GAAP measures are reconciled back to statutory equivalents. They are provided with the clear
intention to aid understanding of performance.

Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of
Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions. Management has identified
that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of
IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

The Board of Directors consider the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK
Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. Group
Costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments.

Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is
therefore not disclosed.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**11. TAXATION (continued)**

**Critical accounting estimates—taxation**

Accruals for current tax and amounts payable under local indirect taxes such as sales taxes and VAT are based
on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood that
tax positions taken will be sustained. Management estimates the amount of taxes payable based upon their
analysis and determines whether provision should be made for potential settlement of disputed positions
which are under negotiation. Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the related
tax amount.

**Current tax**

The tax charge for the period differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.0%. The
differences are explained below:

**For the period**
**10 June 2019 to**
**29 March 2020**
**£m**

Loss on ordinary activities before tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (351.8)

Effect of different tax rates on profits earned outside the UK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.2

**Total taxation charge . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 16.7

The Group has operations across Europe, however, the principal location of trading where the majority of
business profits are derived is the UK. The effective tax rate has therefore been referenced to the UK
corporation tax rate of 19.0% for the period.

_Effective tax rate_

The effective tax rate for the period of (4.7%) is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK
principally as a result of the following differences:

- Permanently disallowable expenditure incurred in relation to the acquisition of BCA Marketplace plc in
the period and on the impairment of goodwill on consolidation;

- The revaluation of deferred tax liabilities in respect of acquired intangibles arising from the change in the
UK corporation tax rate from 17.0% to 19.0% from April 2020; and

- Non-deductible foreign exchange losses arising on the Group’s external Euro borrowings.

Excluding the impact of significant or non-recurring items in the period and the revaluation of deferred tax
balances, the Group has an underlying tax rate of 199.4%. Excluding the impact of the hedged foreign
exchange movements results in an adjusted underlying effective tax rate of 21.4%.

The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. Where points
are investigated, the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds a provision in
respect of the potential tax liability which may arise. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised
when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable
that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are
assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are
measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely outcome method, in line with the interpretation
issued in IFRIC 23. There are no provisions that are individually or collectively material.

**Deferred tax**

**Critical accounting estimates—deferred tax**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent management’s best estimate in determining the amounts to be
recognised. When assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, consideration is
given to the timing and level of future taxable income.

_Deferred tax on losses not recognised_

A deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of £4.2m has not been recognised as at 29 March 2020. Due to the
nature of the losses and resulting restrictions on their use it is not expected that the asset will reverse in future
periods based on current forecasts.

**WORKING CAPITAL AND PROVISIONS**

This section details the assets and liabilities that are directly generated through the Group’s trading activities.
This includes cash and cash equivalents, inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables.
It also includes provisions, commitments and contingencies.

In respect of the Vehicle Remarketing divisions, trade receivables includes the gross auction proceeds due
from buyers, regardless of whether the vehicle was owned by the Group. Gross auction proceeds represent the
full value of the vehicles sold, not just the fees recognised in the income statement. Correspondingly, trade
payables also includes the auction proceeds due to external vendors of vehicles.

Inventories includes vehicles only where the Group holds the risk and rewards of ownership, as detailed in
accounting policy (h). This mainly relates to the Vehicle Buying division and outsourced remarketing contracts
with the UK Vehicle Remarketing division.

**Critical accounting estimates—trade and other receivables**

Loss allowances for trade receivables due from customers under Partner Finance arrangements are recognised
under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the receivable. Management are required to
develop estimates of credit risk using the best available information about past events, current conditions and
forecasts of economic conditions. Partner Finance receivables are asset backed, providing a level of protection
based on the value and recovery of the asset. Management apply judgement in assessing whether there is a
significant change in credit risk which would impact the expected credit loss allowance recognised.

The creation and release of loss allowances on trade receivables in the period has been included in operating
costs in the income statement.

**16. LEASE LIABILITIES**

**Critical accounting estimates—leases**

Management use a lease specific incremental borrowing rate to discount the future lease liabilities, where the
interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available. Using an incremental borrowing rate requires
Management to estimate the rate of interest that would be paid to borrow over a similar term, and with
similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar
economic environment.

The Group leases various properties and other assets under lease agreements. The leases have varying terms,
including escalation clauses, renewal rights and purchase options. None of these terms represent unusual
arrangements.

within leasehold buildings used within the business.

**Capital commitments**

Capital commitments at 29 March 2020 were £7.7m.

**Contingencies**

At any point in time the Company and its subsidiaries may be party to various legal proceedings, some of
which may involve claims for damages. The outcome of such proceedings cannot be readily foreseen.
Management believes that there are no disputes with any third parties that would result in a material liability
for the Group.

**LONG TERM ASSETS**

This section outlines the acquisitions made by the Group in the period, as well as the tangible and intangible
assets held by the Group.

Tangible assets include the physical assets which are used by the Group in the course of business which
generate, or contribute to the generation of, revenue and profit. Tangible assets include the property, plant
and equipment owned by the Group as well as right of use assets available to the Group through lease
arrangements. These assets include property and property improvements used by our divisions, equipment
used by our employees, and our fleet of transporters and other motor vehicles.

Intangible assets are non-physical assets which contribute to, or generate, revenue and profit. These assets
include goodwill, customer relationships and brands, acquired through business combinations. This also
includes software, which can be purchased, acquired through business combinations, or generated internally
based on bespoke requirements and demands in the business. This includes a comprehensive suite of digital
tools which are used by internal and external stakeholders to facilitate and coordinate our business activities.

**18. ACQUISITIONS**

**Critical accounting judgements—acquisition accounting**

For all acquisitions in the period, management are required to apply judgement to determine the business
combination accounting, and in relation to the identification of separable assets and liabilities arising on
acquisition.

_Acquisition of BCA Marketplace plc_

On 6 November 2019 the Group acquired 100% of the Ordinary shares of BCA Marketplace plc (‘BCAM’),
a leading operator in the automotive industry with shares traded on the London Stock Exchange as a
constituent of the UK’s FTSE 250.

The total outstanding BCAM share capital was acquired by BBD Bidco Limited, a subsidiary of the Group,
for cash consideration of £2.3635 per share. The acquisition was completed through a Court sanctioned
scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006. Following the acquisition, BCAM reregistered from a public company to a private limited company.

This has resulted in the acquisition of a number of identified intangible assets including existing brands and
customer relationships and goodwill arising due to the unique position that BCAM has in the automotive
sector, including the value of the geographical presence and assembled workforce in place, significant barriers
to entry for competitors, and access to significant automotive market data and knowledge.

The acquisition also included the identification of fair value adjustments on certain assets and liabilities
acquired, and remaining assets and liabilities that were acquired at book value.

of £179.7m at the acquisition date included £4.0m of contractual cash flows that were not expected to be
received.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**18. ACQUISITIONS (continued)**

Due to the material nature of the acquisition by an otherwise dormant Group, the entire revenue and adjusted
EBITDA of the Group represent the results of the acquisition. Had the acquisition been effective from
incorporation of the Company, estimated revenue for the period would have been £2,850.0m. It is not possible
to estimate the profit for the period since incorporation due to the significant impact of financing
arrangements on the Group’s profits.

_Investment in associate—Proov Station S.A.S_

During February 2020 the Group acquired a 22.02% holding in Proov Station, an automated service
inspection provider, for total consideration of £1.8m. This investment has been identified as an associate
because the Group has significant influence but not control of Proov Station. As a result the investment in
associate has been accounted for using the equity method. The Group has recognised a £0.1m loss for its share
of the result between acquisition and 29 March 2020. This loss has been recognised against the carrying value
of the investment held. Further details are provided in note 29.

**Critical accounting estimates—impairment of goodwill and intangible assets**

An impairment review has been conducted on all goodwill and intangible assets held by the Group. The
impairment review is performed on a value in use basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash
flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth
rate. Specifically, the future cash flows are sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth,
EBITDA margin and the long term growth rate of the relevant market. Given the degree of subjectivity
involved, actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating unit (‘CGU’) or group of
CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination. These CGU

groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for
management purposes. Goodwill is monitored by management at an operating segment level and has been
allocated to operating segments as follows:

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired,
by comparing the carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amounts, which is derived from a
value in use calculation. Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the assets, the assets
are considered as not impaired.

Cash flow forecasts use the budget and 3 year strategic plan forecasts, plus future growth rates. These form the
basis of the cash flow projections for each CGU, and are the basis for the remaining forecast financial years.
The forecast reflects management’s expectations of the medium term operating performance of each CGU
and growth prospects in the CGU’s markets and regions, and are based on the Strategic plan.

Other key assumptions in the value in use calculation are shown below:

Pre-tax discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12.6% 13.1% 14.5% 10.5%

Growth rates used do not exceed expectations of long term growth in the local market.

The discount rate is estimated by the Group using a range of equity costs for similar companies and external
market data, with samples chosen where applicable from the same markets or territories as the CGU.

The calculation of value in use for goodwill is sensitive to the following key assumptions:

- Operating cash flow

- Discount rate

_Covid-19 related goodwill impairment_

During the period, the Group recognised an impairment charge in operating costs of £266.4m. This was spilt
across two cash generating units: Vehicle Remarketing UK (£154.6m) and Vehicle Buying (£111.8m). These
cash generating units are reportable segments as defined in IFRS 8.

In March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of covid-19 a global pandemic and the
governments of many of our markets entered into social distancing lockdown arrangements, which
significantly impacted the Group’s ability to operate as usual.

The impairment charge represents a change in the timing of vehicle volumes expected to flow through the
marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. The Group has tested goodwill in reference to
its value in use, which is based on forecasts of the Group in its current condition and therefore does not
include inflows expected from improving or enhancing the performance of its assets that was expected to arise
following the acquisition, to which the Group is not yet committed.

The used vehicle marketplace, particularly auctions, is historically resilient in periods of economic turbulence.

Management does not consider the markets in which the Group operates to be significantly impacted in the
long run by the outbreak of covid-19.

**CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**

This section details the Group’s capital structure, financing and any associated distributions. This includes
amounts available and utilised in the form of external borrowings. Partner Finance borrowings and lease
liabilities are asset-backed facilities and are therefore presented separately to bank borrowings.

The Group utilises a combination of shareholder equity, bank loans and flexible revolving facilities to manage
the Group’s capital and liquidity requirements, to meet strategic objectives and fund investment opportunities.
This section also includes the capital transactions which have occurred during the period.

In November 2019 the Group refinanced, putting in place a Senior Term facilities agreement and a Second
Lien facility. The Senior facilities agreement comprises Facility B1 £525.0m, Facility B2 €534.5m and a
£155.0m revolving facility. The Second Lien facility comprises Facility F1 £265.0m.

The term facilities were drawn down in full at inception. The facilities were net of arrangement fees of £25.3m
and original issue discount of £6.4m.

The transaction costs, together with the interest expense and original issue discount, are being allocated to the
income statement over the expected duration of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying amount. The
fair value of bank borrowings is equal to the nominal value of the bank loan.

At 29 March 2020, the Group had issued letters of credit in the ordinary course of business of £4.3m, had
drawn down £115.0m on the revolving facility and had utilised £33.4m of overdraft, leaving the following as

Marketplace. All of these shares rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary shares in issue.

The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within shareholder’s funds:

_Share premium_

The value of the net proceeds from shares issued above the nominal value of the shares issued.

**Other reserves**

_Foreign exchange reserve_

Represents the cumulative difference arising from changes to foreign exchange rates upon assets and liabilities
of overseas subsidiaries.

_Retained earnings_

Cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the Group income statement. This does not include retained
earnings held in subsidiaries which could be remitted to the Parent through dividends.

**PENSIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**25. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS**

The Group participates in several defined contribution schemes and two defined benefit schemes (‘the BCA
Pension Plan’ within British Car Auctions Limited and ‘the Automotive Plan’ within Walon Limited).

The BCA Pension Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. The plan is closed to new members.
The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out as of 5
April 2017 and updated to the period end date by Capita, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance
with IAS 19.

The Automotive Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. The plan closed to future accrual
from 1997. The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out
as of 5 April 2016 and updated to the period end date by JLT, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance
with IAS 19.

The defined benefit plans are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework
published by the UK pensions regulator. Benefits are paid to the members from a separate fund administered
by independent trustees. The BCA Pension Plan has five trustees, three of whom are appointed by the Group
and two chosen by scheme members. The Automotive Plan has four trustees, two of whom are appointed by
the Group and two chosen by scheme members. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the
members and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.

As part of the acquisition an additional contribution of £2.0m was made to the BCA Pension Plan, which is
included within employer contributions paid in the period.

**Critical accounting estimates—pensions**

The Group’s net retirement benefit obligation, which is reviewed by management using assessments from
independent actuaries each period, is based on key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation, future
salary increases and pension costs. These assumptions may be different to the actual outcome.

**Risk management**

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as mortality risk, interest rate risk and
market investment risk. The investment policies of each scheme are described below:

_Asset volatility . . . ._ Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted
basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the
plan assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit. The trustees of each
plan, and their advisers, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan
and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. Currently
the plans hold approximately 40% of assets as defensive assets (government and
corporate bonds) with the intention of mitigating significant changes in yields.
As each plan matures, the level of investment risk is reduced by investing more in
government and corporate bonds that better match the liabilities. However, the Group
believes that due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing
equity investment is an appropriate element of the long term investment strategy.
In respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’) obligations, the strategy has the
objectives of achieving an overall rate of return that is sufficient to meet pensioners’
reasonable expectations, reduce investment return volatility over the short term period
to retirement where this is possible and to invest in assets that are liquid such that they
enable switching between asset classes. In order to achieve these objectives, the strategy
is to invest in a mixture of on-risk assets (including equities) and off-risk assets
(including bonds, gilts and cash), with the proportionate allocation of the latter
increasing according to an agreed profile as members approach their normal retirement
date.

_Inflation . . . . . . . ._ The plans’ pension liabilities in deferment are linked to inflation. Higher inflation will
lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of
inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans
from extreme inflation. The BCA Pension Plan holds approximately 6% of the plans’
assets in index-linked bonds (including government bonds) to partially hedge against
this risk. The remainder of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by or loosely
correlated with inflation, and so an increase in inflation can lead to an increase in the
plan deficit.

_Mortality . . . . . . ._ The plans’ obligation is to provide a pension for the life of their members, so realised
increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ benefit payments.
Whilst future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty the plans adopt up to
date mortality assumptions and review the overall risk as part of the triennial actuarial
valuations.
_Bond yields . . . . . ._ Plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is due to
an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive
assets held by the plans. This risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan
liabilities being linked to bond yields. An increase in interest rates has the effect of
increasing bond yields, which in turn decreases plan liabilities. If interest rates decrease
the opposite is true for both plan liabilities and assets.
_Salary changes_ . . . . The calculation of the BCA Pension Plan liabilities uses the future estimated salaries
of plan participants. Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed
will increase the plan liabilities.

The Automotive Plan is closed to future accruals, so is not exposed to this risk.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used. The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of
the defined benefit obligations to changes in the significant assumptions used for the schemes.

Mortality: long term rate of longevity improvement: +0.25% . . . . . n/a (0.5) n/a (3.1)%

The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, and
in practice this is unlikely to occur. The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably
possible fluctuations.

**Expected future cash flows**

The Group expects the employer contributions to be made to its defined benefit plans in the 2020/21 financial
year to be £1.5m. The Group’s management do not expect any material changes to the annual cash
contributions over the next three years; however it keeps contributions under review in the light of movements
in the funding position of the schemes.

The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to
members over the next several decades. The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 17 years for the
BCA Pension Plan and 18 years for the Automotive Plan.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS—RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)**

**Financial risk management**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk
and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of risk
management is carried out by the Board.

**Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices (principally exchange rates and interest rates) will affect
the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

**Foreign exchange risk**

The Group operates in the UK and continental Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland) and is therefore exposed to foreign
exchange risk. Foreign exchange risk arises primarily on recognised assets and liabilities and net investments
in foreign operations. These overseas operations’ revenues and costs are mainly denominated in the currencies
of the countries in which the operations are located. The most significant of these is the Euro. The Euro to
Sterling exchange rates used by the Group are shown below:

**For the**
**period ended**
**29 March 2020**

Euro–opening (period start) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.1213

Euro–acquisition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.1625

Euro–average . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.1464

Euro–closing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.1176

The functional currencies of the revenue and adjusted EBITDA of the Group’s operations are as follows:

**For the period ended 29 March 2020**

**GBP** **Euro** **Other** **Total**

Revenue (£m) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,330.4 115.2 15.0 1,460.6

Revenue (%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 91.1% 7.9% 1.0% 100.0%

Adjusted EBITDA (£m) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 73.1 14.4 1.6 89.1

Adjusted EBITDA (%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 82.0% 16.2% 1.8% 100.0%

The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures. The Group monitors
its exposure to currency fluctuations on an ongoing basis. The Group maintains part of its debt in Euro to
reflect the currency in which its EBITDA is generated.

The Group has not hedged profit translation exposures. During the period and as at 29 March 2020 the
Group did not have any hedges in place.

For the period ended 29 March 2020, if Sterling had strengthened by 10% on average against the Euro with all
other variables held constant, adjusted EBITDA for the year would have been £1.3m lower as a result of a
reduction of the equivalent value in Sterling of profits denominated in Euros.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

**26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS—RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)**

Details of the currencies in which the Group’s cash, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and
loans and overdrafts are denominated are set out below:

**As at 29 March 2020**

**GBP** **Euro** **Other** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

Cash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 151.0 51.8 11.0 213.8
Trade and other receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 348.3 50.0 7.8 406.1
Trade and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (261.2) (106.8) (20.6) (388.6)
Borrowings (including Partner Finance borrowings) . . . . . . . . . . . . (1,042.6) (470.8) — (1,513.4)

**Net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** (804.5) (475.8) (1.8) (1,282.1)

**Interest rate risk**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the Group’s borrowings as disclosed in note 22. Interest rates have
been historically low and stable in terms of both LIBOR and EURIBOR rates and consequently no structured
hedging has been implemented in the current period. The Group will continue to monitor interest rates and
assess the requirement for hedging in the future. All of the Group’s finance leases are at fixed rates of interest.

For the period ended 29 March 2020, if the average rate on floating rate borrowings had been 50 basis points
higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the period would have been £6.6m lower.

**Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss in the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally through trade receivables from customers and
cash balances.

The Group has policies in place to ensure that services are only provided to clients with an appropriate credit
history.

Customers who have an account with BCA Partner Finance are able to finance vehicles acquired through UK
Vehicle Remarketing. Prior to opening an account and subsequently, a credit assessment is completed and
appropriate security is obtained. In addition, legal title of the vehicle remains with the Group until the
outstanding balance is settled in full.

Cash and cash equivalents are held with reputable institutions. The cash required for working capital is held
with reputable banks in each country of operation as appropriate. All other material cash balances are
deposited with financial institutions whose credit rating is at least Standard and Poor’s A- or equivalent.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group Finance.
Group Finance monitors forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to
meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities
at all times so that the Group minimises the risk of breaching borrowing limits or covenants on any of its
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plan and covenant
compliance requirements on its borrowings.

The Group has a £155.0m revolving facility. At 29 March 2020 £115.0m of the facility had been drawn,
£35.0m of ancillary RCF as overdraft, as well as £4.3m of the facility having been utilised to provide
guarantees to third parties. This revolving facility is considered by management to provide adequate flexibility
given the current liquidity of the business.

The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based
on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in
the tables below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows:

**Capital risk management**

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF**
**BCA MARKETPLACE PLC**

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Opinion**

In our opinion, BCA Marketplace plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the
“financial statements”):

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2019 and
of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company’s financial statements, as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the Consolidated and Company balance sheets as at 31 March 2019; the
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated and
Company cash flow statements, and the Consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the
year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant
accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for
the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed
public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company.

Other than those disclosed in note 11 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to
the Group or the Company in the period from 2 April 2018 to 31 March 2019.


-----

**Our audit approach**

**Overview**

**The scope of our audit**



- Overall Group materiality: £6,640,000 (2018: £6,000,000), based on 5% of profit
before tax, adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles and significant or
non-recurring items.

- Overall Company materiality: £313,000 (2018: £410,000), based on 5% of loss before
tax adjusted for significant or non-recurring items and intercompany recharges.

- Full scope audits performed for two financially significant components; British Car
Auctions Limited and We Buy Any Car Limited.

- Additional full scope audits performed for BCA Marketplace plc, BCA Central Limited,
BCA Vehicle Finance Limited (‘Partner Finance’), and BCA Outsource Solutions Limited.

- Audit of items arising on consolidation along with certain line items for Walon Limited,
BCA Fleet Solutions Limited and Paragon Fleet Solutions Limited (part of the
Automotive Services division).

- Goodwill and acquired intangibles may be impaired, refer to page 128 (note 19) for
management’s disclosure.

- Partner Finance debtors may not be recoverable, refer to page 124 (note 15) for
management’s disclosure.

- Significant or non-recurring items may not be appropriately classified, refer to page 115
(note 6) for management’s disclosure.

- Software development projects must have technical feasibility, intention to complete
and expected future economic benefit in order to capitalise costs, refer to page 128
(note 19) for management’s disclosure.

- There are no key audit matters in relation to the Company.


As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in
the financial statement.

**Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud**

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of
non-compliance with laws and regulations related to, but were not limited to, the Listing Rules, pensions
legislation and UK and European tax legislation, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance
might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that
have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We
evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements
(including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to
manipulating financial performance to achieve targeted results through posting inappropriate journal entries,
management bias in accounting estimates or judgement in selecting accounting policies. The Group
engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include
appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the
Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:

- Discussions with management, internal audit and the Group’s legal advisors, including consideration of
known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;

- Evaluation of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities, in particular their antibribery controls;

- Assessment of matters reported on the group’s whistleblowing helpline and the results of management’s
investigation of such matters;

- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates,
in particular in relation to impairment of intangible fixed assets (see related key audit matter below);

- Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account
combinations or posted by senior management

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed
non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement
due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate
concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.


-----

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in
the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts
of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon,
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks
identified by our audit.

**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

_Goodwill and acquired intangibles may be impaired_ To assess the risk of impairment we have obtained an
_Refer to page 128 (note 19) for management’s_ understanding of management’s methodology and
_disclosure_ approach to considering impairment including the

identification of CGUs, and ensured this approach is
consistent with prior periods and IAS 36.
As a result of the acquisitions made over the past We performed a detailed review of management’s
4 years, significant goodwill of £950.1m and acquired year end impairment assessment and ensured the
intangibles comprising £498.9m of brand and calculations were mathematically accurate. In
customer relationships, and £8.4m of software fair performing this review we have agreed the underlying
value uplift have been recognised on the balance data on which the assessment is based to other

deemed to be recoverable and hence should be forecasts.
impaired.


Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, all Cash
Generating Units (‘CGUs’) containing goodwill must
be tested for impairment annually.

To fulfil this requirement, management perform an
impairment review on an annual basis for each of its
CGUs, along with additional impairment reviews
whenever an indication of impairment exists.

The impairment reviews performed by management
contain a number of significant judgements and
estimates including revenue growth rates and
discount rates. A change in these assumptions can
result in a material change in the valuation of the
assets, and as a result there is a risk that goodwill is
no longer deemed to be recoverable and hence should
be impaired.

As a result, assessment of the carrying value of
goodwill is a significant risk due to the quantum of
the balance and the level of estimation involved.

_Partner Finance debtors may not be recoverable_
_Refer to page 124 (note 15) for management’s_
_disclosure_

At 31 March 2019, £171.8m of trade receivables were
due from customers under Partner Finance
arrangements.


We have assessed the reasonableness of growth
assumptions used in management’s forecasts by
comparing them to historical performance. We
considered all assumptions used by management to
be reasonable.

We performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment
assessment to understand the extremity of
assumptions required in order to “break the model”.
We did not identify any CGUs requiring an
impairment.

We have also assessed the adequacy of disclosures
made and assessed compliance with IAS 36.

For a sample of significant debtors we have tested the
outstanding customer balance at the year end to
subsequent cash receipt to prove the recoverability of
the year end balance, with no issues noted. In
addition we have tested a sample of the remaining
population of subsequent receipts to cash and
performed the following procedures over the
remaining balance.

We reviewed the quantum of aged debt and tested the
aging of the debtor report on which management’s
provision is based. We also reviewed debtor balances
due from customers considered to be at higher risk of

events as well as current and future economic
conditions for Partner Finance customers.
We did not identify any customer balances deemed to
be irrecoverable which were not already provided for
by management.

There is a risk that standard items of expenditure are
incorrectly classified in order to better present the
underlying trading results of the Group and the
adjusted measure used by management.

_Software development projects must have technical_
_feasibility, intention to complete and expected future_
_economic benefit in order to capitalise costs_


We have evaluated management’s disclosures and are
satisfied that adjusted performance measures are
reconciled to IFRS measures in the financial
statements and the rationale for their use is clearly
explained by management.

We have reviewed a sample of significant projects
developed during the year through review of budgets,
expected use and distinguishable product.


Refer to page 128 (note 19) for management’s We have considered whether the criteria for
disclosure capitalisation has been met under the requirements
of IAS 38 and have performed detailed testing of
costs capitalised to supporting documentation to
verify the value.


IAS 38 requires criteria to be met in order to capitalise
internally generated software costs including its
technical feasibility and intention to complete.


We have evaluated the assessment of period of
amortisation management have used by considering
the time period for future economic benefit, i.e. a
market for the output or specific customer contract
length.


We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.

**How we tailored the audit scope**

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

BCA Marketplace delivers a comprehensive range of linked services in the automotive industry. The Group
owns and operates the UK’s and Europe’s largest used vehicle exchange and is the UK’s leading provider of
vehicle buying services. The Group operates from a number of distinct legal entities across the UK and Europe
which are split across four main divisions generating revenue being UK Vehicle Remarketing, International
Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. These represent the Group’s operating
segments together with Group costs. Central Group services and financial reporting procedures are performed
by the UK HQ.

Our scoping considerations for the Group audit were based both on financial information and risk. British
Car Auctions Limited and We Buy Any Car Limited represent the majority of the trading results for the


-----

Group and are individually financially significant based upon the adjusted profit before tax they contribute to
the overall trading results. As a result we performed an audit of the complete financial information of both
entities providing coverage of 74% of the Group’s adjusted profit before tax. In addition we performed an
audit of the complete financial information of BCA Central Limited, BCA Vehicle Finance Limited and
BCA Outsource Solutions Limited as a result of the number of individually significant financial statement
line items within each of these entities. To provide further coverage on an individual financial statement line
item level, we also performed specific audit procedures over property, plant and equipment and cash and cash
equivalents for Walon Limited and trade receivables for BCA Fleet Solutions Limited and Paragon Fleet
Solutions Limited, both within the Automotive Services segment.

**Materiality**

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds
for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit
and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and
disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial
statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Company financial statements**

**Overall materiality** £6,640,000 (2018: £6,000,000). £313,000 (2018: £410,000).


**How we determined it** 5% of profit before tax, adjusted
for amortisation of acquired
intangibles and significant or
non-recurring items.

**Rationale for benchmark applied** Based on the benchmarks used in
the annual report, profit before tax
is the primary measure used by the
shareholders in assessing the
performance of the Group, and is
a generally accepted auditing
benchmark. Profit before tax has
been adjusted for items which are
not representative of the
underlying results of the business
and which are therefore adjusted
in the reconciliation presented
below the income statement.


5% of loss before tax adjusted for
significant or non-recurring items
and intercompany recharges.

We believe that loss before tax is
the primary measure used by the
shareholders in assessing the
performance of the entity, and is a
generally accepted auditing
benchmark.


For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall
Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £313,000 and
£6,270,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our
overall Group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit
above £ 330,000 (Group audit) (2018: £300,000) and £15,700 (Company audit) (2018: £20,000) as well as
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

**Going concern**

We are required to report if the directors’ statement We have nothing to report.
relating to going concern in accordance with Listing
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our
knowledge obtained in the audit.


**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express
an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance
thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of
the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based
on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the
Companies Act 2006 (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless
otherwise stated).

**Strategic report and Directors’ report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic
report and Directors’ report for the year ended 31 March 2019 is consistent with the financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’
Report. (CA06)

**The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency**
**or liquidity of the Group**

We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:

- The directors’confirmation on page 89 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future
performance, solvency or liquidity.


-----

- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or
mitigated.

- The directors’ explanation on page 87 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability
of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries
and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in
alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company
and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)

**Other Code Provisions**

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:

- The statement given by the directors, on page 90, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to
be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the
Group’s and Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent
with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the course of performing our audit.

- The section of the Annual Report on page 86 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

- The directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the
auditors.

**Directors’ Remuneration**

In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**
**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and
Accounts set out on page 90, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The
directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or
the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s report.


-----

**Use of this report**

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in
writing.

**OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING**

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’Remuneration Report to be audited are not
in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Appointment**

Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on
31 October 2014 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 and subsequent
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 5 years, covering the years ended
31 December 2014 to 31 March 2019.

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS**

**1.** **General information**

BCA Marketplace plc (‘BCA’, ‘the Group’ or the ‘Company’), was incorporated in April 2014; its aim was to
acquire and manage companies in the UK and European automotive sector. On 2 April 2015, BCA
Marketplace plc acquired the BCA Group (‘BCA Group’). This was followed by the acquisitions of SMA
Vehicle Remarketing Limited (‘SMA’) on 1 June 2015, Stobart Automotive Limited (‘BCA Automotive’) on
25 August 2015, Ambrosetti (U.K.) Limited (‘Ambrosetti’) on 4 February 2016, Paragon Automotive Limited
(‘Paragon’) on 18 July 2016 and Supreme Wheels Direct Limited (‘Supreme Wheels’) on 31 March 2017. On
21 December 2017 the shares owned by the non-controlling interest in Life on Show Limited were acquired
and during the year the remaining shares owned by the non-controlling interest in Tradeouts Limited were
acquired.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to
as the ‘Group’). The Parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a
separate entity and not about its Group, and can be found on pages 148 to 153.

The Company is a public limited company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and
domiciled in the UK with the registered number 09019615. The address of the Company’s registered office is
Haversham House, Coronation Business Park, Kiln Road, Kempston Hardwick, Bedford, MK43 9PR.

BCA Marketplace plc is a constituent of the UK’s FTSE 250 and its shares are traded on the London Stock
Exchange (LON:BCA).

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019 have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’)
interpretations as adopted by the European Union (‘Adopted IFRS’) and with those parts of the Companies
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial
liabilities (including derivatives) at fair value through profit or loss.

The financial statements and the notes to the financial statements are presented in millions of Pounds Sterling
(‘£m’) except where otherwise indicated.

Judgements made by the Directors in the application of the accounting policies that have a significant effect
on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are
discussed in note 5.

**Going concern**

The Group maintains a mixture of medium-term debt, committed credit facilities, finance lease arrangements
and cash reserves, which together are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds to
finance its operations. The Board reviews forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements based on a range of
scenarios to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on
its committed borrowing facilities at all times, so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants
(where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

After making appropriate enquiries and having considered the business activities and the Group’s principal
risks and uncertainties, the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

**Basis of consolidation**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**2.** **Basis of preparation (continued)**

Losses applicable to non-controlling interests are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so
causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.

Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Gains arising from transactions with jointly
controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Losses are eliminated in the
same way as gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

**Foreign currency translation**

The functional currency of the Company and the majority of entities within the Group is Pounds Sterling
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. The Group’s
presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.

_Transactions and balances_

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency of Group entities using
the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of unsettled
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
income statement within finance income or costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in
the income statement within other income or other operating costs.

_Consolidation of Group companies_

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities including goodwill, intangible assets arising on acquisition and fair value adjustments
arising on consolidation for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of
that balance sheet;

- income and expenses for each income statement presented are translated at average exchange rates (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the
transactions); and

- all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are accumulated in the
foreign exchange translation reserve or non-controlling interest.

On disposal of a foreign subsidiary the cumulative amount of the exchange differences recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange translation reserve is recognised in the income
statement when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

The exchange rates used for the translation of other currencies into Pounds Sterling that have the most
significant impact on the Group results are shown in note 27.

**3.** **New standards, amendments and interpretations**

**a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

In the current period the Group has adopted the following new or amended standards and interpretations:

_IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers_

On 2 April 2018 the Group adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the cumulative
effect method. As a result, the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported
under IAS 18. The current and previous accounting policies can been seen in note 4.

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**3.** **New standards, amendments and interpretations (continued)**

The impact of the standard has been limited due to the short-term nature of the majority of transactions in
the Group, and because the fundamental principles of agency and principal revenue recognition have remained
consistent with IAS 18. Due to the transition method taken, the prior year comparative is not required to be
restated, although external revenue under both IAS 18 and IFRS 15 has been disclosed in the tables below for
clarity:

_Takeover sale adjustment_

The UK and International Vehicle Remarketing divisions will purchase a vehicle from a vendor in certain
circumstances in order to honour a sale. This occurs where, for example, a buyer has reneged on the purchase
or there was an error in the sales process. This typically represents between 1% and 2% of remarketing volume.
Applying the five step process prescribed by IFRS 15, the resale will be recognised in revenue, not cost of sales.
This is due to there being a deemed contract between BCA and the buyer, with a clear performance obligation
and a determined transaction price. This is considered a cost of business and the purchase and subsequent
resale have historically been netted down within cost of sales. Consequently, the effect of the adoption of the
new accounting policy is to increase both revenue and cost of sales with no net impact on gross margin.

_Faster payment adjustment_

The UK Vehicle Buying division offers a faster payment service at additional cost to the vehicle seller.
Historically this fee has been netted down against the purchase price of the vehicle within cost of sales. Under
IFRS 15 this fee is now recognised within revenue, as there is an identifiable service and therefore performance
obligation within the vehicle purchase contract. Consequently, the effect of the adoption of the new
accounting policy is to increase both revenue and cost of sales with no net impact on gross margin.

As a result of the adoption of IFRS 15 the Revenue accounting policy in note 4(a) and the Inventories
accounting policy in note 4(g) have been amended.

_IFRS 9—Financial Instruments_

On 2 April 2018 the Group adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. There have been no changes to the carrying
value or classification of existing financial assets and liabilities within the Group.

Financial assets held by the Group consist of loans and receivables, and mainly comprise trade receivables.
The majority of trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component and so are initially

recognised at the transaction price as opposed to fair value under IAS 39. The impairment criteria for financial
assets have been amended from the incurred loss model to the Expected Credit Loss (‘ECL’) model.

With respect to trade receivables provision for impairment, IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39
with the ECL model. From 2 April 2018 the Group has measured provision for impairment at an equivalent
value to lifetime ECL.

The impact of these changes is immaterial and so the prior year figures have not been restated. The Financial
assets accounting policy in note 4(h) has been amended as described above.

**b) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted**

_i. Summarised impact_

Standards and interpretations which are issued but not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the
Group are summarised in the table below. For more detail on the Group assessment of the impact of the new
standards see b)ii):

**Standard** **Applicable from** **Amendments** **Expected impact**


**IFRS 16** 1 Jan 2019 The standard establishes principles for
Leases the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of leases,
other than short-term and low-value
assets, and replaces IAS 17 leases. IFRS
16 will result in the recognition of a lease
liability and corresponding right of use
asset on the Group’s balance sheet in
respect of the majority of operating
leases. The timing and presentation of
charges recognised in the income
statement will change, with current
operating lease expenses replaced by
depreciation of the right of use asset and
interest on the lease liability.

There will be a significant
impact on the Group’s
financial position and
performance. The likely
effects are explained in b)ii).

The Group are currently
assessing the effect of the
interpretation and in
particular how the
measurement of uncertainty
under the expected value
method will impact the
positions.


_ii. Detailed Group assessment_

_IFRS 16—Leases_

The lessee accounting requirements will have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position and
performance. A number of the Group’s properties, transporters and other operational equipment are currently
accounted for as operating leases, but under IFRS 16 lease liabilities and right of use assets will be recognised
instead. The key impacts are as follows:

- Balance sheet—At present minimum lease payments under operating leases are disclosed in note 17.
Following adoption the rights and obligations arising from all in-scope leases will be recognised as right of
use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. This is consistent with the current treatment of finance
leases. The right of use assets are initially recognised at the present value of future lease payments plus
initial direct costs and are subsequently depreciated over the lease term. The lease liabilities are initially


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**3.** **New standards, amendments and interpretations (continued)**

measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made during the term of the lease. Following
initial recognition, the carrying amounts will be increased for the effective interest and reduced by the
payments made.

This will result in a material change to the balance sheet. The measurement of the right of use assets and
lease liabilities will involve judgement particularly in relation to the lease term, as well as in relation to the
discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future payments. The Group currently recognises
obligations under both operating leases and finance leases which will be derecognised on transition to
IFRS 16.

- Income statement—Operating lease costs are currently charged to operating costs. Under IFRS 16 the
right of use assets will be depreciated and the effective interest on the lease liabilities will be charged to
finance costs. Following adoption, IFRS 16 will have a favourable impact on adjusted EBITDA due to
depreciation and finance costs being excluded from this key performance indicator, but is expected to have
an unfavourable impact on profit before tax. This is expected to reduce by £4m to £6m following adoption.

- Cash flow statement—Under IFRS 16, the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities will be
reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the interest portion will be included in cash flows from
operating activities. At present the full operating lease payment is reflected in cash flows from operating
activities. Whilst there is no impact on net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, it will increase
cash flows from operating activities and decrease cash flows from financing activities.

- Out of scope leases—Leases under $5,000 (or equivalent) or 12 months in length will not be accounted for
as described above and will continue to be treated as operating leases, with the cost in operating costs in the
income statement and future payments not reflected on the balance sheet. The total cost in the income
statement will continue to be disclosed in the operating costs disclosure note.

The Group has introduced a new lease accounting software solution to assist in the ongoing management and
accounting of leases under IFRS 16. This tool has been subject to various testing and benchmarking processes
to ensure that it is suitable to meet the current and future needs of the business.

The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and has not adopted early. On
adoption, the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 will be recognised in equity. Management have elected to
take several practical expedients on transition. IFRS 16 will result in expanded disclosures due to the
requirements of the standard and the material nature of the Group lease portfolio. Further details including
the adjustments recognised on transition will be disclosed in the Interim Results Report 2019.

_IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments_

For the period starting 1 April 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments will become effective
which clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement of income taxes under IAS 12.

The interpretation establishes methodology to be used in assessing the appropriate level of provision where
there is uncertainty over the income tax treatment. Different methods of calculation are expected to be used in
different circumstances, taking into account the nature of the uncertainty and whether the outcome is expected
to be within a range or whether a binary outcome is expected.

The Group are currently assessing the effect of the interpretation and in particular how the measurement of
uncertainty under the Expected Value method will impact the positions. The Group expect to apply the
interpretation using the modified retrospective approach, and will recognise any change in the cumulative
provision on adoption as an adjustment to opening equity. The Group do not expect the impact of adopting
the interpretation to be material. Further details will be disclosed in the Interim Results Report 2019.

**4.** **Accounting policies**

**(a) Revenue**

This policy has been amended following the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers as
discussed in note 3.


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**4.** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods and services supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group
recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s
activities, as described below.

Vehicle auction revenue represents vendor and buyer fees for vehicles sold by the Group together with fees for
related services including transportation, inspection, valeting and mechanical checks. Revenue is recognised
at the time the service is provided, which is predominantly at the point the vehicle is sold at auction. Revenue
represents the fees for the auction service not the value of the vehicle sold, as the Group does not incur the
significant risks and rewards of ownership as part of the transaction.

In the ordinary course of business at vehicle auctions, in certain circumstances BCA will purchase a vehicle
from a vendor in order to honour a sale where, for example, a buyer has reneged on the purchase or there was
an error in the sales process. The subsequent resale vehicle proceeds are recognised in full as takeover revenue
on the date of resale.*

Revenue from outsourced remarketing contracts, where the Group takes legal title of certain vehicles based
on contractual agreements, represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is
recognised on the date of sale.*

Interest and loan origination fees earned in respect of the provision of Partner Finance loans are recognised
over the term of the funding and are included within revenue. Fees charged by Partner Finance are recognised
evenly over the period that the relevant service is provided.

Vehicle buying revenue represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised
on the date of sale. Transaction fees charged to vendors of vehicles are recognised on the purchase invoice
date and treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory and therefore recognised within the cost of sales.

Revenue for other services, including logistics and automotive services, is recognised once the contracted
service has been provided. For transportation or delivery services this is deemed to be when the customer has
received the vehicle; for storage services this is deemed to be once an activity has been completed, such as
receiving and parking a vehicle, and generally on a daily basis for storage charges; for vehicle repair and
vehicle enhancement work this is deemed to be when work has been completed to a stage that can be invoiced
to the customer; and for fleet services management this is deemed to be over the period the service is provided
on a straight line basis.

**(b) Advertising and marketing costs**

The Group carries out a variety of advertising and marketing activities. These include advertising activities
which correlate to the number of vehicles that are acquired by the Group through the Vehicle Buying division
and for subsequent sale through the Group’s auctions for which revenue is recognised. These direct advertising
costs are therefore recognised as a cost of sale. All other indirect advertising and marketing costs are recognised
within operating costs.

The cost of advertising design is expensed as incurred and the expense of advertising campaigns is expensed
in the income statement in the period in which the advertising space or air time is utilised.

- _This accounting policy was updated following the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with_
_Customers on 2 April 2018. The comparative has not been restated. The previous accounting policy under_
_IAS 18 also included:_

_“Outsourced vehicle auction revenue represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is_
_recognised on the date of sale. It is the customers’ intention for the Group to take legal title of certain vehicles_
_based on contractual agreements with corporates before the vehicle is sold to the end customer through the various_
_remarketing channels.”_

_The full accounting policy under IAS 18 can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts 2018._


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**4.** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**(c) Net finance costs**

_Finance costs_

Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, direct transaction costs, unwinding of the discount
on provisions, net interest cost of defined benefit pension arrangements and foreign exchange losses on finance
balances. Transaction costs are amortised over the life of the debt using the effective interest method.

_Finance income_

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains on finance
balances. Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest method.

**(d) Taxation**

Income tax for the years presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in income
statement or statement of other comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to taxes payable in respect of prior periods.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial
recognition of other assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a
business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are unlikely
to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention
to settle the balances on a net basis.

Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the
liability to pay the related dividend.

**(e) Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months
or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow
statement.

**(f) Offsetting financial instruments**

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is
a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**4.** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**(g) Inventories**

Inventories primarily represent vehicles acquired by the Group that have not yet been sold and where the
Group has the risk and reward of ownership of such vehicles. Other inventories include vehicle parts. All
inventories are stated at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value. Cost represents expenses incurred
in bringing each product to its present location and condition. In the Vehicle Buying division the vehicle cost
is net of any administration fees paid to the Group by the seller of the vehicle. Net realisable value is based on
estimated normal selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred on completion of the sale and
disposal.

_This accounting policy was updated following the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers_
_on 2 April 2018. The comparative has not been restated. The previous accounting policy under IAS 18 also_
_included:_

_“The UK Vehicle Remarketing division in the ordinary course of business will purchase a vehicle from a vendor in_
_order to complete a sale where a buyer has reneged on the purchase or there was an error in the sales process. This_
_represents between 1% and 2% of UK volume and is considered a cost of business and so the purchase value and_
_subsequent resale value have historically been netted down within cost of sales.”_

_The full accounting policy under IAS 18 can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts 2018._

**(h) Financial assets**

_Classification_

The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Management determines the classification of
its financial assets at initial recognition.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that arise
principally through the provision of services to customers. These loans and receivables do not contain a
significant financing component and are initially recognised at the transaction price. They are included in
current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Loans and
receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.

_Impairment of financial assets_

Impairment provisions are recognised under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the
receivable. The expected credit loss model is calculated using the simplified approach as there is no significant
financing component. This approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised based on an expected
default rate.

For trade receivables, which are reported net of any provisions, such provisions are recorded in a separate
provision account with the loss being recognised within operating costs in the income statement. On
confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off
against the associated provision.

**(i) Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

**(j) Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as
a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**4.** **Accounting policies (continued)**

expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage
of time is recognised in finance costs.

_Property leases and dilapidations_

Provisions for onerous leases on property are recognised when it is probable that future obligations under the
lease will exceed earnings achievable from the property, taking into account the Directors’ estimation of likely
income from the subletting of vacant property. The amounts of such net outflows are discounted at the
risk-appropriate rate, and are stated net of any anticipated sublease income.

Provisions for dilapidations are made in respect of property leases on a lease by lease basis and are based on
the Group’s best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. Where relevant, these estimated outflows are
discounted to net present value.

**(k) Intangible assets**

Intangible assets comprise internally generated software, acquired computer software, and intangible assets
such as customer relationships and brands arising as part of the assessment of assets on the acquisition of a
business. These are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.

Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the
development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 are met. Costs incurred before this point are expensed as
incurred and are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. The assessment identifies unique software
products that are controlled by the Group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs
beyond one year. Salary and related employment costs that are directly attributable to the development of the
software are then capitalised. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in
equal annual amounts over the estimated useful life of the software.

Amortisation and impairment are charged to operating costs in the period in which they arise. Amortisation
is calculated on a straight line basis from the date on which the assets are brought into use, with useful lives as
indicated below:

Customer relationships. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 – 20 years

Brand. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 – 25 years

Software–Internally generated. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 10 years

Software–Acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 7 years, or the licence term if shorter

Assets acquired through business combinations are amortised over the remaining useful life at acquisition.

Amortisation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. For the Group’s
impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets.

**(l) Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and is recognised initially as the excess of the consideration
transferred, over the Group’s interest in fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Goodwill is stated
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units, which are no higher
than an operating segment prior to aggregation, and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.

An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of
goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount. Goodwill that is not denominated in Sterling is retranslated at each
balance sheet date.

**(m) Impairment of non-financial assets**

Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not subject to amortisation. As a result it is tested annually for
impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**4.** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Other assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for
the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows
(‘cash generating units’), which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of
assets. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible
reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**(n) Property, plant and equipment**

_Owned assets_

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing
the asset to its working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment
have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and
equipment. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Group and when the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised in the income statement.

_Assets under construction_

The costs of assets that are being constructed are capitalised as described in the Owned assets paragraph
above. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is deemed to be available for use. For the
asset to be available for use it has to be in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the intended manner. Once the asset is available for use it is no longer classified as an asset under
construction and is instead depreciated like any other item of property, plant and equipment.

_Leased assets_

Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are
classified as finance leases. Property, plant and equipment acquired under a finance lease is recorded at fair
value or, if lower, the present value of minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less depreciation and
any impairment.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental
obligations, net of finance charges, are included in the other short-term or long-term payables as appropriate.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged
directly to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives received
are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term, on a straight line basis.

_Depreciation_

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Any property, plant and equipment acquired under a
finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Freehold land
and assets under construction are not depreciated. The rates of depreciation are as follows:

Land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 years, or the unexpired lease period if shorter

Fixtures, fittings and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 – 10 years

Plant, machinery and motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 25 years


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**4.** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Assets acquired through business combinations are depreciated over the remaining useful life at acquisition.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. For
the Group’s impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets.

**(o) Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the
draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be
drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the expected
utilisation of the facility to which it relates.

**(p) Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are
shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds.

Where the Group purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable
to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such Ordinary shares are
subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction
costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

**(q) Employee benefits**

_Pension obligations_

The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit plans.

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not
hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior
periods. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

The defined benefit plans operated by the Group in the United Kingdom are closed to new members. The
costs of providing benefits under the plans are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation
method.

The current service cost is included in operating costs in the consolidated income statement. Past service costs
are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight line basis
over the vesting period. Administrative scheme expenses associated with the plans are recorded within
operating costs when incurred in line with IAS 19. Net interest income or interest cost relating to the funded
defined benefit pension plans is included within finance income or finance costs as relevant in the consolidated
income statement.

Changes to the retirement benefit obligation or asset due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, presented as remeasurements of the
defined benefit scheme in full in the period in which they arise.

Where scheme assets exceed the defined benefit obligation the net asset is only recognised to the extent that an
economic benefit is available to the Group in accordance with the terms of the scheme and where consistent
with relevant statutory requirements.

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**4.** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Share based payment transactions_

The Group operates equity-settled, share based plans. The fair value of the employee services received in
exchange for the grant of the awards is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the compensation as determined by independent
valuations. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are
expected to vest.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over
the period during which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant
employees are expected to become fully entitled to the award (vesting date).

At each reporting date, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions reflects, in the
opinion of the Directors, the number of awards that will vest and the proportion of the period to vesting that
has expired. Directors’ estimates are based on the best available information at that date.

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional
upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting, irrespective of whether or not the market condition is
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.

**5.** **Critical accounting judgements and estimates**

The preparation of the Group’s consolidated and Parent Company financial statements under Adopted IFRS
requires the Directors and management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Accounting
policies are reviewed annually for appropriateness. Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and
are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, with any changes
arising being recognised in the period in which the change in estimate is made or the final result determined.

Certain of the Group’s significant accounting policies are considered by the Directors to be critical because of
the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the
consolidated financial statements. The principal critical accounting judgements in prior years related to
determining the acquisition accounting in relation to the acquisition of the BCA group, and the identification
of separable assets and liabilities arising on each acquisition. There were no unusual or significant transactions
in the year that required critical judgement. Details of judgements can be found in note 18 on page 127.

Details of critical accounting estimates can be found in the following notes:

**RESULTS FOR THE YEAR**

The following pages provide information about the financial performance for the year on a segmental and
Group basis.

A detailed narrative regarding Group and divisional performance has been provided in the Group operating
review section on pages 29 to 35. The key performance indicators, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings
per share are presented and defined in notes 6 and 7. These are considered key performance indicators because
management use these measures to assess long and short-term performance of the Group on a periodic basis.

This section also provides details of the primary operating and finance costs, as well as providing analysis on
employee related information and taxation.

**6.** **Segmental reporting**

**Key Performance Indicator—adjusted EBITDA**

Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is
defined as Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) adjusted for
significant or non-recurring items. The significant or non-recurring items that are excluded from EBITDA to
calculate adjusted EBITDA are as follows:

- income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business
closure costs, restructuring costs and onerous lease provisions;

- impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment,
intangibles and goodwill;

- amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of the predecessor BCA Group and other
businesses; and

- acquisition expenses and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership.

The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s
activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible
assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and
are not reflective of underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA
measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence are not directly comparable.

Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of
Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions. Management has identified
that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of
IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

The Board of Directors consider the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK
Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. Group
Costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments.

Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is
therefore not disclosed.

**7.** **Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary
shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the basic earnings per share to take account of the effect
of employee share schemes.

Adjusted earnings per share is presented in addition to the disclosures required by IAS 33, Earnings per
Share, to align the adjusted earnings measure with the performance measure reviewed by the Directors. The
Directors consider that this gives a more appropriate indication of underlying performance. Adjusted earnings
per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders,
adjusted for significant or non-recurring items and their associated tax impact, by the weighted average
number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

**Critical accounting estimates—taxation**

Accruals for current tax and amounts payable under local indirect taxes such as sales taxes and VAT are based
on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood that
tax positions taken will be sustained. Management estimates the amount of taxes payable based upon their
analysis and determines whether provision should be made for potential settlement of disputed positions
which are under negotiation. Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the related
tax amount.

The Group has operations across Europe, however, the principal location of trading where the majority of
business profits are derived is the UK. The effective tax rate has therefore been referenced to the UK
corporation tax rate of 19.0% for the year.

_Effective tax rate_

The effective tax rate for the year of 23.4% (2018: 24.9%) is different to the standard rate of corporation tax
in the UK as a result of higher income tax rates in Europe, the impact of permanently disallowable items and
provisions charged in the year, and the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in the UK and Europe.

Permanently disallowable items comprise expenditure incurred which does not qualify for a tax deduction in
the territory in which it arises and includes depreciation on assets not qualifying for tax deductions and
current year movements on provisions for uncertain tax positions. Prior period adjustments relate primarily
to the remeasurement of fixed assets qualifying for tax deductions which have been disposed of in prior
periods.

Excluding the impact of the significant or non-recurring items in the year, the Group has a tax rate of 22.5%
(2018: 23.1%). This is in line with the 22.5% effective tax rate estimated in the Interim Results Report for the
six months ended 30 September 2018.

The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. Where points
are investigated, the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds a provision in
respect of the potential tax liability which may arise. There are no provisions that are individually or
collectively material. For the period starting 1 April 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
will become effective, and further details can be found in note 3.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19.0% (effective from 1 April 2017) and 17.0% (effective 1
April 2020) were substantively enacted prior to the balance sheet date. This will reduce the Group’s future tax
charge accordingly. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reported at the balance sheet date have been measured
using a blend of these rates, based on when the relevant tax liability or asset is expected to crystallise.
Management expects the Group’s underlying tax rate to remain in the low-twenties in the short-term, before
the anticipated impact of the future reduction in the corporation tax rate in the UK, France and the
Netherlands reduces the overall tax rate from 2020 onwards.

A deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of £4.0m has not been recognised as at 31 March 2019 (2018:
£3.6m). Due to the nature of the losses and resulting restrictions on their use it is not expected that the asset
will reverse in future periods based on current forecasts.

**WORKING CAPITAL AND PROVISIONS**

This section details the assets and liabilities that are directly generated through the Group’s trading activities.
This includes cash and cash equivalents, inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables.
It also includes provisions, commitments and contingencies.

In respect of the Vehicle Remarketing divisions, trade receivables includes the gross auction proceeds due
from buyers, regardless of whether the vehicle was owned by the Group. Gross auction proceeds represent the
full value of the vehicles sold, not just the fees recognised in the income statement. Correspondingly, trade
payables also includes the auction proceeds due to external vendors of vehicles.

Inventories include vehicles only where the Group holds the risk and rewards of ownership, as detailed in
accounting policy (g). This mainly relates to the Vehicle Buying division and outsourced remarketing contracts
with the UK Vehicle Remarketing division.

Provisions, commitments and contingencies includes onerous lease provisions, which have arisen in relation
to properties and land which are no longer in use, but which have not yet come to the end of their lease
contract. It also includes payments which will be made in the future under operating lease agreements.

**Critical accounting estimates—onerous lease provision**

When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the
present value of the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group provides for any further
onerous element of the contract. Determining the amount of such a provision requires estimating the future
net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties are
vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any
works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet.

_Onerous lease provision_

Prior to the acquisition of the BCA group, two properties in the UK had been identified for which the Group
had no future use. A provision exists for the minimum lease payments estimated to be paid until the end of the


-----

leases in 2031, net of management’s estimate as to likely revenues receivable in respect of subleases or other
uses of the properties. The future payments have been discounted, where appropriate, at the risk—appropriate
rate of 3%.

_Other provisions_

This balance primarily relates to a dilapidations provision, which was made in order to make good any defects
within leasehold buildings used within the business and is expected to be utilised within the next ten years.

**Capital commitments**

Capital commitments at 31 March 2019 were £4.8m (2018: £8.6m).

**Operating lease commitments**

The Group leases various properties and other assets under operating lease agreements. The non-cancellable
lease terms are between three months and 58 years, and certain of the lease agreements are renewable at the
end of the lease period at market rates.

The total future aggregate minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:

The total future aggregate minimum lease payments due to the Group under sublease are £0.2m (2018: £0.3m).

**Contingencies**

At any point in time the Company and its subsidiaries may be party to various legal proceedings, some of
which may involve claims for damages. The outcome of such proceedings cannot be readily foreseen.
Management believes that there are no disputes with any third parties that would result in a material liability
for the Group.

**LONG-TERM ASSETS**

This section outlines the acquisitions made by the Group in the year, as well as the tangible and intangible
assets held by the Group.

The Group have made a number of acquisitions since inception. Note 18 describes the acquisitions made in
the current and prior years, as well as the key components of each acquisition.

Tangible assets include the physical assets which are used by the Group in the course of business which
generate, or contribute to the generation of, revenue and profit. Tangible assets are owned by the Group, or
are leased under finance leases. These assets include property and property improvements used by our
divisions, equipment used by our employees, and our fleet of transporters and other motor vehicles. The
Group also uses other properties, equipment and vehicles which are controlled by the Group through
operating leases, detailed in note 17.

Intangible assets are non-physical assets which contribute to, or generate, revenue and profit. These assets
include goodwill, customer relationships and brands, acquired through business combinations. This also
includes software, which can be purchased, acquired through business combinations, or generated internally

based on bespoke requirements and demands in the business. This includes a comprehensive suite of digital
tools which are used by internal and external stakeholders to facilitate and coordinate our business activities.

**18.** **Acquisitions**

**Critical accounting judgements—acquisition accounting**

For all acquisitions, management are required to apply judgement to determine the business combination
accounting, and in relation to the identification of separable assets and liabilities arising on those acquisitions.

**Critical accounting estimates—acquisition accounting**

For acquisitions, management make estimates of future cash flows to value the assets and make estimates in
determining the useful economic life of intangible assets.

Management has estimated the fair value of contingent consideration likely to arise on the acquisition of
subsidiary undertakings by taking account of financial and market targets over the relevant period of time.
The time value of money was estimated using an appropriate discount rate.

**Current period transactions**

_Tradeouts_

During the year, the Group acquired the remaining 49% of the Ordinary shares in Tradeouts Limited, a
non-trading company, for nil consideration. The Group had previously acquired 51% of the Ordinary shares
in Tradeouts Limited in July 2014 and had included the entity within the Group consolidation from this
point.

_Paragon_

On 18 July 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the Ordinary shares of Paragon Automotive Limited and
subsidiary companies for initial consideration of £102.7m, which was subject to adjustment based on certain
circumstances and contingent earn-out payments of up to a maximum of £30m, subject to achievement of
financial and market targets over the two financial years ending March 2017 and 2018. During the year ended
31 March 2019 the second earn-out payment was paid in line with management estimations at the time of
acquisition.

**Prior period transactions**

_Life on Show_

Amortisation charges have been treated as operating costs in the income statement.

**Critical accounting estimates—impairment of goodwill and intangible assets**

An impairment review has been performed of all goodwill and intangible assets held by the Group. The
impairment review is performed on a value in use basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash
flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth
rate. Specifically, the future cash flows are sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth,
adjusted EBITDA margin and the long-term growth rate of the relevant market. Given the degree of
subjectivity involved, actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates. The detailed assumptions
used and associated sensitivity analysis are discussed below.

**Critical accounting estimates—capitalisation of software development costs**

In applying IAS 38, management has estimated the future economic benefit that will be driven by software
development. The estimated useful life of software is based on management’s view, considering historical
experience and anticipated future events which may impact their life. Management review estimated lives as
technology and commercial requirements change.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating unit (‘CGU’) or group of
CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies associated with that business combination. These CGU
groups represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for
management purposes. Goodwill is monitored by management at an operating segment level and has been
allocated to operating segments as follows:

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired,
by comparing the carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amounts which is derived from a
value in use calculation. Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the assets, the assets
are considered as not impaired. No impairment charges were incurred in the year ended 31 March 2019 (2018:
£nil).

Cash flow forecasts cover a period of five years following the year end. The first year of forecast is the Board
approved budget. The budget forms the basis of the cash flow projections for each CGU which are used to
forecast the next four financial years. The forecast reflects management’s expectations of the medium-term
operating performance of each CGU and growth prospects in the CGU’s markets and regions, and are based
on the Strategic plan as approved by the Board.

Other key assumptions in the value in use calculation are shown below:

**Vehicle Remarketing**

Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 1.8% 1.0% 1.8% 1.0% – 1.8%

Pre-tax discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.4% 11.1% 10.0% 9.3% – 11.0%

Growth rates used do not exceed expectations of long-term growth in the local market.

The discount rate is estimated by the Group using a range of equity costs for similar companies and external
market data, with samples chosen where applicable from the same markets or territories as the CGU.

The calculation of value in use for goodwill is sensitive to the following key assumptions:

- Operating cash flow

- Discount rate

The Directors have reviewed the key assumptions used in the impairment calculations and have not identified
reasonably likely changes in those assumptions that would give rise to an impairment.

book value of £3.4m (2018: £3.9m) and accumulated depreciation of £0.9m (2018: £0.8m) and plant,
machinery and motor vehicle assets under finance leases with a net book value of £36.4m (2018: £29.3m) and
accumulated depreciation of £16.5m (2018: £10.3m).

**CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**

This section details the Group’s capital structure and associated distributions. This includes amounts available
and utilised in the form of external borrowings. Net debt as defined by the Group represents the external
borrowings utilised, less available cash. This does not include Partner Finance borrowings or finance lease
liabilities, which are asset-backed facilities and are therefore presented separately.

This section also includes the amounts raised from shareholders in the form of share capital and the capital
transactions which have occurred during the year, which include dividends paid. The Group uses share based
incentive schemes as part of its overall remuneration policy. These are discussed in more detail in accounting
policy (q) and note 25.

In February 2017 the Group agreed a £500m multi-currency facility, including a £250m revolving facility and
a £250m term loan. The term loan was drawn down in full and £90m of the revolving facility was initially
drawn down, net of transaction costs of £2.9m, and used to repay the previous debt facility held within the
Group. During the year the Group extended the facility for a further 12 months to 6 February 2022, with no
repayment of the term loan due before that time. The extension has been accounted for as a modification of
the existing multi-currency facility.

Carrying amounts are stated net of unamortised transaction costs. The transaction costs, together with the
interest expense, are being allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate on
the carrying amount. The fair value of bank borrowings is equal to the nominal value of the bank loan as the
impact of discounting is not significant. The fair value of gross bank borrowings is £348.0m (2018: £328.9m)
which is equal to the nominal value. The effective interest rate including the impact of non-utilisation fees on
the revolving facility and the utilisation fees for the letters of credit drawn down from the revolving facility, as
well as the amortisation of debt issue costs is 2.4% (2018: 2.3%).

The Group’s principal bank loans at 31 March 2019 were denominated in Sterling £296.3m (2018: £276.3m)
and Euros €60.0m (2018: €60.0m), and bear variable interest based on LIBOR and EURIBOR respectively.
They were secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Group’s present and future assets.

At 31 March 2019, the Group had issued letters of credit in the ordinary course of business of £4.3m (2018:
£4.4m) and had drawn down £90.0m (2018: £70.0m) of the revolving facility, leaving the following as undrawn

For more information about the Group’s exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk see note 27.

**22.** **Partner Finance borrowings**

The Group has an asset-backed finance facility to fund the Partner Finance business. During the prior year,
Partner Finance completed the syndication and extension of the BCA Partner Finance facility, increasing the
facility to £200.0m on comparable terms. The amount is advanced solely to a Partner Finance subsidiary in
respect of specific receivables. Interest is charged on the drawn down element of the facility at a variable rate
of interest, based on the Bank of England base rate. At 31 March 2019 the borrowings were £120.1m (2018:
£105.5m).

The holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per
share at meetings of the Company. The movements in share capital are described below:

- Net proceeds from shares issued—relate to vesting of share based payments (see note 25). All of these
shares rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary shares in issue.

- Employees’ share scheme allotments—relate to vesting of shares (see note 25). All of these shares rank
_pari passu with the existing Ordinary shares in issue._

- Acquisition of treasury shares—on 19 December 2018 the Company purchased 13,160,000 of its own
shares for a total consideration of £25.2m including commission and stamp duty reserve tax.

The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within shareholders’ equity:

**Treasury reserve**

The value of the Ordinary shares of BCA Marketplace plc purchased by the Group. These shares do not carry
voting rights and are not entitled to receive dividends.

**Merger reserve**

- This dividend has been proposed by the Directors subject to approval by the shareholders at the AGM

The 2019 final dividend, payable during the year ended 29 March 2020, has been proposed by the Directors
and is subject to approval by the shareholders at the AGM. All dividends to date were settled in cash. The
total dividend is subject to the number of shares in issue on 20 September 2019.

The distributable reserves of BCA Marketplace plc approximate to the balance of the retained profit of
£993.4m as at 31 March 2019. The Company’s reserves are at a sufficient level to provide significant support
for future dividends, at over 13 times the current annual dividend. The Company has significant distributable
reserves (see Company balance sheet on page 148), and the cash and profits generated by the operating
companies in the Group are regularly distributed by dividends as required.

**25.** **Share based payments**

During the current and prior periods, share based incentives were in place for senior executives within the
Group. These arrangements were based around shares in H.I.J. Limited (‘H.I.J.’) and were subject to the
Share Incentive Scheme Cap (‘the Incentive Cap’), which restricts the aggregate value of all share incentives in
place to a maximum value of 10% of the growth in Shareholder Value, which is broadly defined as the increase
in market capitalisation of all Ordinary shares of the Company issued up to the date of vesting, allowing for
any dividends and other capital movements.

The Group had the option to settle all incentives in issue either for cash or in exchange for Ordinary shares at
its discretion. Throughout their existence it has been assumed that the incentives would be equity settled and
the accounting treatment has been applied accordingly.

There were two incentive schemes in place during the prior period, the H.I.J. scheme (which applies to the
Company and the Group) and the Performance based scheme (which applies to the Group only).

**(a) The H.I.J. scheme**

The H.I.J. scheme was subject to both a Growth condition and the satisfaction of at least one of the Vesting
conditions.

_i. Growth condition_

The Growth condition required that the average compound annual growth of the Company’s equity value
must be at least 10% per annum. The Growth condition was measured from 10 November 2014, when the
Company was admitted to trading on AIM (‘AIM Admission’) and takes into account new shares issued,
dividends and capital returned to shareholders.

_ii. Vesting conditions_

At least one of the Vesting conditions must be (and continue to be) satisfied:


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**25.** **Share based payments (continued)**

- a sale of all or a material part of the business of H.I.J. Limited;

- a sale of all of the issued Ordinary shares of H.I.J. Limited occurring;

- a winding up of H.I.J. Limited occurring;

- a sale or change of control of the Company; or

- it is later than the third anniversary of AIM Admission.

**(b) The Performance based scheme**

Performance based scheme was subject to the same Growth condition and Vesting conditions described above
and in addition was also subject to further Performance conditions.

_iii. Performance conditions_

The Performance conditions were based on the business’s key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) including
volumes, average revenue/unit and adjusted EBITDA. Under these measures, points accrued over a three-year
period ending 1 April 2018, which determined the proportion of the scheme to vest, up to a maximum of
1.5% of the growth in Shareholder Value.

**Scheme movements**

The H.I.J. scheme was exercised in full on 18 December 2017. This resulted in the issue of 24,009,071 Ordinary
shares, which were issued in exchange for the H.I.J. shares held. At the time of exercise the share price was
£2.08.

The Performance based scheme qualified in full for the 1.50% participation in increase in Shareholder Value
and was settled on 18 April 2018, by the transfer of 2,245,554 Ordinary shares held in treasury by the
Company, representing the net amount after deduction of income tax and employee National Insurance
contributions. No exercise price was payable in respect of these shares, which were issued when the share price
was £1.78.

In line with IFRS 2 the net settlement is considered an equity settlement and both the share transfer and
settlement of income tax and National Insurance contributions are included in the consolidated statement of
changes in equity (£7.3m). The shares transferred from treasury were recorded at the weighted average price at
which they were acquired (£1.71).

The share based incentives in issue during the year and prior year are shown in the table below. No share
based incentives were issued during the current or prior periods:

**Valuation of share based incentives**

**Critical accounting estimates—share based payments**

The key estimates used in calculating the fair value of the options are the fair value of the Company’s shares
at the grant date, the expected share price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the
instrument and the number of shares expected to vest. The Group’s share based payments were valued at
inception by independent valuation experts.

The share based incentives were assumed to be equity-settled and have been accounted for in accordance with
IFRS 2.

The value of the services received in exchange for the share based incentives is measured by reference to the
fair value of the incentives at their grant date. The fair value is recognised in the consolidated income
statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on a straight line basis over the
vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.

Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Group.

At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected
to vest due to non-market conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in
the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders’ equity. At the year end,
there were no outstanding share based incentives.

During the year, no charge has been recognised in the consolidated income statement as a charge in relation to
the share based incentives (year ended 1 April 2018: £2.0m). 2,245,554 treasury shares were issued in
April 2018 in respect of the Performance based scheme. The tax and National Insurance arising from the
settlement of the share scheme is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

**PENSIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**26.** **Pensions and other post-retirement benefits**

The Group participates in several defined contribution schemes and two defined benefit schemes (‘the BCA
Pension Plan’ within British Car Auctions Limited and ‘the Automotive Plan’ within Walon Limited).


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**26.** **Pensions and other post-retirement benefits (continued)**

The BCA Pension Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. The plan is closed to new members.
The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out as of 5
April 2017 and updated to the year end date by Capita, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance with
IAS 19.

The Automotive Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. The plan closed to future accrual
from 1997. The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out
as of 5 April 2016 and updated to the year end date by JLT, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance
with IAS 19.

The defined benefit plans are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework
published by the UK pensions regulator. Benefits are paid to the members from a separate fund administered
by independent trustees. The BCA Pension Plan has five trustees, three of whom are appointed by the Group
and two chosen by scheme members. The Automotive Plan has four trustees, two of whom are appointed by
the Group and two chosen by scheme members. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the
members and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group.

On 26 October 2018 the English High Court ruling in Lloyds Banking Group Pension Trustees Limited v
Lloyds Bank plc and others held that UK pension schemes with Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs)
accrued from 17 May 1990 must equalise for the difference in GMPs between men and women. Consequently
the Group incurred a non-recurring pension cost of £2.2m in the year reflecting the initial estimate of applying
the ruling.

**Critical accounting estimates—pensions**

The Group’s net retirement benefit obligation, which is reviewed by management using assessments from
independent actuaries each period, is based on key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation, future
salary increases and pension costs. These assumptions may be different to the actual outcome.

The potential impact of equalisation on each scheme has been estimated, taking into account the proportion
of liabilities affected, the proportion of males and females and the potential cost of equalisation for members.
The impact on the BCA Automotive Plan is relatively large because of the high proportion of benefit
obligations that are affected and the high proportion of males in the scheme.

The principal assumptions used for the BCA Pension Plan and the Automotive Plan are as follows:

**Risk management**

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as mortality risk, interest rate risk and
market investment risk. The investment policies of each scheme are described below:


-----

**FINANCIALS**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)**

**26.** **Pensions and other post-retirement benefits (continued)**

_Asset volatility. . . . . . . ._ Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a
discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate
bond yields. If the plan assets underperform this yield, then this will create a
deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisers, carry out regular reviews of
asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line
with the investment strategies. Currently the plans hold approximately 40% of
assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) with the intention of
mitigating significant changes in yields.
As each plan matures, the level of investment risk is reduced by investing more in
government and corporate bonds that better match the liabilities. However, the
Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level
of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term
investment strategy.
In respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’) obligations, the strategy
has the objectives of achieving an overall rate of return that is sufficient to meet
pensioners’ reasonable expectations, reduce investment return volatility over the
short-term period to retirement where this is possible and to invest in assets that
are liquid such that they enable switching between asset classes. In order to
achieve these objectives, the strategy is to invest in a mixture of on-risk assets
(including equities) and off-risk assets (including bonds, gilts and cash), with the
proportionate allocation of the latter increasing according to an agreed profile as
members approach their normal retirement date.

_Inflation . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’pension liabilities in deferment are linked to inflation. Higher inflation
will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on
the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to
protect the plans from extreme inflation. The BCA Pension Plan holds
approximately 5% of the plans’ assets in index-linked bonds to partially hedge
against this risk. The remainder of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by or
loosely correlated with inflation, and so an increase in inflation can lead to an
increase in the plan deficit.

_Mortality . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’ obligation is to provide a pension for the life of their members, so
realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ benefit
payments. Whilst future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty the
plans adopt up to date mortality assumptions and review the overall risk as part
of the triennial actuarial valuations.

_Bond yields . . . . . . . . . ._ Plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is
due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the
defensive assets held by the plans. This risk is partially mitigated by the
measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields. An increase in interest
rates has the effect of increasing bond yields, which in turn decreases plan
liabilities. If interest rates decrease the opposite is true for both plan liabilities
and assets.
_Salary changes . . . . . . ._ The calculation of the BCA Pension Plan liabilities uses the future estimated
salaries of plan participants. Increases in the salary of plan participants above
that assumed will increase the plan liabilities. The Automotive Plan is closed to
future accruals, so is not exposed to this risk.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The disclosures above are dependent on the assumptions used. The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of
the defined benefit obligations to changes in the significant assumptions used for the schemes.

Discount rate: +0.25% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (3.4) (0.6) (4.2)% (3.9)%

Mortality: increase in life expectancy of one year . . . . . . . . . n/a (0.5) n/a (2.9)%

The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, and
in practice this is unlikely to occur. The above variances have been used as they are believed to be reasonably
possible fluctuations.

**Expected future cash flows**

The Group expects the employer contributions to be made to its defined benefit plans in the 2019/20 financial
year to be £1.6m. The Group’s management do not expect any material changes to the annual cash
contributions over the next three years; however it keeps contributions under review in the light of movements
in the funding position of the schemes.

The defined benefit obligations are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to
members over the next several decades. The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 17 years for the
BCA Pension Plan and 16 years for the Automotive Plan.

**Financial risk management**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk
and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of risk
management is carried out by the Audit and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board of Directors.

**Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices (principally exchange rates and interest rates) will affect
the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

_Foreign exchange risk_

The Group operates in the UK and continental Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands,
Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Norway, and Switzerland) and is therefore exposed to foreign
exchange risk. Foreign exchange risk arises primarily on recognised assets and liabilities and net investments
in foreign operations. These overseas operations’ revenues and costs are mainly denominated in the currencies
of the countries in which the operations are located. The most significant of these is the Euro. The Euro to
Sterling exchange rates used by the Group are shown below:

The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures. The Group monitors
its exposure to currency fluctuations on an ongoing basis. The Group maintains part of its net debt in Euros
to reflect the currency in which its adjusted EBITDA is generated.

The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposures. During the year and as at 31 March 2019
the Group did not have any hedges in place.

For the year ended 31 March 2019, if Sterling had strengthened by 10% on average against the Euro with all
other variables held constant, adjusted EBITDA for the year would have been £2.3m lower (for the year ended
1 April 2018: £2.0m lower) as a result of a reduction of the equivalent value in Sterling of profits denominated
in Euros.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the Group’s borrowings as disclosed in note 21. Interest rates have
been historically low and stable in terms of both LIBOR and EURIBOR rates and consequently no structured
hedging has been implemented in the current year. The Group will continue to monitor interest rates and
assess the requirement for hedging in the future. All of the Group’s finance leases are at fixed rates of interest.

For the year ended 31 March 2019, if the average rate on floating rate borrowings had been 50 basis points
higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £1.4m lower (for the
year ended 1 April 2018: £1.4m lower).

**Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss in the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally through trade receivables from customers and
cash balances.

The Group has policies in place to ensure that services are only provided to clients with an appropriate credit
history.

Customers who have an account with BCA Partner Finance are able to finance vehicles acquired through UK
Vehicle Remarketing. Prior to opening an account and subsequently, at least on an annual basis, a credit
assessment is completed and appropriate security is obtained. In addition, legal title of the vehicle remains
with the Group until the outstanding balance is settled in full.

Cash and cash equivalents are held with reputable institutions. The cash required for working capital is held
with reputable banks in each country of operation as appropriate. All other material cash balances are
deposited with financial institutions whose credit rating is at least Standard and Poors A- or equivalent.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Group and aggregated by Group Finance.
Group Finance monitors forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to
meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities
at all times so that the Group minimises the risk of breaching borrowing limits or covenants on any of its
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plan and covenant
compliance requirements on its borrowings.

The Group has a £250m (2018: £250m) revolving facility. At 31 March 2019 £90.0m (2018: £70.0m) of the
facility had been drawn, as well as £4.3m (2018: £4.4m) of the facility having been utilised to provide
guarantees to third parties. This revolving facility is considered by management to provide adequate flexibility
given the current liquidity of the business.

**Capital risk management**

The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base (which comprises share capital, reserves and net debt
excluding finance leases and Partner Finance borrowings) so as to maintain creditor and market confidence
and to sustain future development of the business. There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital
management during the year.

**Fair value**

The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their carrying value.

**28.** **Related party transactions**

Remuneration of the Directors, who constitute the key management personnel of the Group, has been
disclosed in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 70 to 83.

In the prior year, £0.2m was paid to Marwyn Capital LLP for corporate finance advisory fees, ongoing
administrative and office services. There was no balance owing as at 31 March 2019 and 1 April 2018. Since
the resignation of Mark Brangstrup Watts and James Corsellis in December 2017, payments to Marwyn
Capital LLP are no longer related parties.

The Group has not made any provision for bad or doubtful debts in respect of related party debtors, nor has
any guarantee been given during the period regarding related party transactions.

**29.** **Events after the reporting period**

On 20 June 2019, BCA announced that the Board was aware of media speculation in relation to the Company
and confirmed that it was in advanced discussions with TDR Capital LLP regarding a possible all cash offer
for the Company.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

BCA Marketplace Limited (the ‘Company’), was incorporated in April 2014; its aim was to acquire and
manage companies in the UK and European automotive sector. On 2 April 2015, BCA Marketplace Limited
acquired the BCA Group (‘BCA Group’). This was followed by the acquisitions of SMA Vehicle Remarketing
Limited (‘SMA’) on 1 June 2015, Stobart Automotive Limited (‘BCA Automotive’) on 25 August 2015,
Ambrosetti (U.K.) Limited (‘Ambrosetti’) on 4 February 2016, Paragon Automotive Limited (‘Paragon’) on
18 July 2016 and Supreme Wheels Direct Ltd (‘Supreme Wheels’) on 31 March 2017. On 21 December 2017
the shares owned by the non-controlling interest in Life on Show Limited were acquired. During the
comparative period, the remaining shares owned by the non-controlling interest in Tradeouts Limited were
acquired, and during the current period the remaining shares owned by the non-controlling interest in Carland
Limited were acquired.

The Company is a private limited company, and was previously listed on the London Stock Exchange as BCA
Marketplace plc. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the UK with the registered
number 09019615. The address of the Company’s registered office is Headway House, Crosby Way, Farnham,
England, GU9 7XG.

**2.** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

These condensed consolidated financial statements for the period from 1 April 2019 to 5 November 2019 do
not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of sections 434 and 435 of the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European
Union.

The annual financial statements of BCA Marketplace Limited are prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations as
adopted by the European Union (‘Adopted IFRS’) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable
to companies reporting under IFRS. The condensed consolidated set of financial statements do not include
all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 March 2019. These condensed
consolidated interim financial statements and notes to the accounts disclose only those material changes in
balances and accounting policies by reference to those documents.

The comparative balance sheet figures as at 31 March 2019 are extracted from the BCA Marketplace plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2019. Those accounts have been reported on by the auditor and delivered to the
Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor was (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any
matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and (iii) did
not contain a statement under Section 498 (2) and (3) of the Companies Act 2006.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved for issue on 5 July 2021. The results
for the current and comparative interim income statement, interim statement of comprehensive income and
interim cash flow statement are unaudited. The Group’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has carried
out a review of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

The financial statements and the notes to the financial statements are presented in millions of pounds Sterling
(‘£m’) except where otherwise indicated.

**Going concern**

The Group maintains a mixture of medium-term debt, committed credit facilities, finance lease arrangements
and cash reserves, which together are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds to
finance its operations. The Board reviews forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements based on a range of
scenarios to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on
its committed borrowing facilities at all times, so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants
(where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.

After making appropriate enquiries and having considered the business activities and the Group’s principal
risks and uncertainties, the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the condensed
consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.


-----

**Basis of consolidation**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention.

Aside from those noted below, the same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation have
been applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements as were applied in the BCA
Marketplace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2019.

The accounting policies that differ relate to the adoption of IFRS 16, which is described in Note 4, and
taxation, which in the interim period is accrued using the effective tax rate that would be applicable to the
expected total annual earnings.

**3.** **CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES**

The preparation of the Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements under adopted IFRS
requires the Directors and management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Accounting
policies are reviewed annually for appropriateness. Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and
are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates with any changes
arising being recognised in the period in which the change in estimate is made or the final result determined.

The same critical accounting judgements, critical accounting estimates, methods of computation and
accounting treatments have been applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements as were
applied in the BCA Marketplace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2019.

There were no unusual or significant transactions in the period that required judgement. Existing judgements,
where applicable, are contained within the accounting policies. The critical accounting estimates affecting the
Group’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements were related to taxation; lease liabilities;
acquisitions; intangible assets and pensions and other post-retirement benefits.

**4.** **NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS**

In the current period, the Group has adopted the following new or amended standards and interpretations:

**Adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on 1 April 2019**

In the current period, the Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases.

As anticipated, the lessee accounting requirements have had a significant impact on the Group’s financial
position and performance. A number of the acquired Group’s properties, transporters and other operational
equipment were previously accounted for as operating leases, but under IFRS 16 lease liabilities and right of
use assets have been recognised instead. The key impacts are as follows:

- Balance sheet—Under IAS 17 minimum lease payments under operating leases were disclosed in the notes
to the accounts. Following IFRS 16 adoption the rights and obligations arising from all in-scope leases have
been recognised as right of use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. This is consistent with the
historic treatment of finance leases. The right of use assets were initially recognised at the present value of
future lease payments plus initial direct costs and are subsequently depreciated over the lease term. The
lease liabilities were initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made during the
term of the lease. Following initial recognition, the carrying amounts have been increased for the effective
interest and reduced by the payments made. The measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities
involves judgement particularly in relation to the lease term, as well as in relation to the discount rate used
to calculate the present value of the future payments.

- Income statement—Operating lease costs were charged under IAS 17 operating costs. Under IFRS 16, the
right of use assets have been depreciated and the effective interest on the lease liabilities has been charged to
finance costs. Following adoption, IFRS 16 has a favourable impact on adjusted EBITDA due to
depreciation and finance costs being excluded from this key performance indicator, but has an unfavourable
impact on profit before tax.

- Cash flow statement—Under IFRS 16, the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities has
been reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the interest portion has been included in cash
flows from operating activities. Previously the full operating lease payment was reflected in cash flows from


-----

operating activities. Whilst there is no impact on net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, it has increased
cash flows from operating activities and decreased cash flows from financing activities.

- Out of scope leases—Leases under $5,000 (or equivalent) or 12 months in length have not been accounted
for as described above and continue to be treated as operating leases, with the cost in operating costs in the
income statement and future payments not reflected on the balance sheet. The total cost in the income
statement will continue to be disclosed in the operating costs disclosure note.

For Group leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases, the gross carrying amount of the
respective asset and liability immediately before adoption has been determined as the appropriate carrying
amount at adoption.

The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach. On adoption, the cumulative
effect of applying IFRS 16 was recognised in equity. Management elected to take several practical expedients
on transition:

- Not to recognise right of use assets or lease liabilities for leases ending within 12 months from transition

- As an alternative to performing an impairment test, adjust the asset on transition by the amount of any
previously recognised onerous lease provision

- Excluded initial direct costs in the measurement of the right of use asset

**Restatement of opening balance sheet**

The following table presents the impact of adoption on the opening balance sheet of the Company at 1
April 2019.

The transition method chosen by the Group results in a small reduction in opening retained earnings and
lower corresponding right of use assets on specific high-value or long-term leased assets held by the Group,
which results in lower future depreciation. This also creates a deferred tax asset on transition to IFRS 16.

-----

In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the
standard:

- Reliance on previous assessments of whether leases are onerous;

- The accounting for operating leases, with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 April 2019,
as short-term leases;

- The exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right of use assets at the date of initial
application, unless previously identified; and

- The use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or
terminate the lease.

The Group has elected not to use a single discount rate for a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar
characteristics, to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application, or to
separate non-lease components from lease components. Instead, for contracts entered into before the
transition date, the Group relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRC 4, ‘Determining whether
an Arrangement contains a Lease’.

Following the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, the Group’s accounting policies have been updated accordingly:

**Leases**

_The Group as a lessee_

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. The Group recognises
a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the
lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low
value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern
in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted by using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily
determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position and is
subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the
effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use
asset) whenever:

- the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

- the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using the initial discount rate (unless the change in lease payments is due to a change in a floating
interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used).

- the lease payments substantially change or other rent concessions are agreed with the lessor during the lease
term.

- a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments
made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on
which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the
lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. The costs are included in the related right of use
asset, unless those costs relate to assets which are accounted for as short-term assets.


-----

Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying
asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the
Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of
the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account
for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this
practical expedient. The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 16 to leases of intangibles.

_The Group as a lessor_

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its properties. These are classified
as operating leases unless the terms of the lease substantially transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership to
the lessee.

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

**5.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING**

**Key Performance Indicator—adjusted EBITDA**

Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is
defined as Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) adjusted for
significant or non-recurring items (‘SONR’). The significant or non-recurring items that are excluded from
EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA are as follows:

- Income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business
closure costs and restructuring costs;

- Impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment,
intangibles and goodwill;

- Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition;

- Acquisition expenses, and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership.

The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s
activities, as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible
assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and
are not reflective of underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA
measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence are not directly comparable.

All non-GAAP measures are reconciled back to statutory equivalents. They are provided with the clear
intention to aid understanding of performance.

Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of
Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions. Management has identified
that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of
IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

The Board of Directors considers the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK
Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. Group
costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments.

Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is
therefore not disclosed.

**6.** **INCOME TAX**

The tax charge of £10.8m (2018: £12.6m) includes a £5.5m (2018: £5.1m) net tax credit in relation to significant
or non-recurring items including £5.0m (2018: £4.8m) in relation to amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
Despite a lower effective tax rate the income tax charge is higher than in the period to 28 October 2018
primarily due to the increased profitability of the Group. The underlying effective tax rate before significant
or non-recurring items is 20.5% (2018: 22.7%), reflecting a decrease in the Group’s proportion of overseas tax
liabilities, incurred at a higher rate than in the UK.

**10. LEASE LIABILITIES**

**Critical accounting estimates—leases**

Management use a lease-specific incremental borrowing rate to discount the future lease liabilities, where the
interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available. Using an incremental borrowing rate requires
Management to estimate the rate of interest that would be paid to borrow over a similar term, and with
similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar
economic environment.

The Group leases various properties and other assets under lease agreements. The leases have varying terms,
including escalation clauses, renewal rights and purchase options. None of these terms represent unusual
arrangements.

As at 5 November 2019, there were commitments to future undiscounted lease payments of £0.1m in respect
of leases which had not yet commenced.

In February 2017 the Group agreed a £500m multi-currency facility, including a £250m revolving facility and
a £250m term loan. The term loan was drawn down in full and £90m of the revolving facility was initially
drawn down, net of transaction costs of £2.9m, and used to repay the previous debt facility held within the
Group. During the year ended 31 March 2019 the Group extended the facility for a further 12 months to 6
February 2022, with no repayment of the term loan due before that time. The extension has been accounted
for as a modification of the existing multi-currency facility.

**12. PARTNER FINANCE BORROWINGS**

The Group has an asset-backed finance facility to fund the Partner Finance business. During the year ended
1 April 2018, Partner Finance completed the syndication and extension of the BCA Partner Finance facility,
increasing the facility to £200m on comparable terms. The amount is advanced solely to a Partner Finance
subsidiary in respect of specific receivables. Interest is charged on the drawn down element of the facility at a
variable rate of interest, based on the Bank of England base rate. At 5 November 2019 the borrowings were
£149.2m (31 March 2019: £120.1m).

On 29 July 2019, the Board of Directors of BCA Marketplace plc announced the passing of resolutions at a
Court Meeting and General Meeting of BCA Marketplace plc Shareholders held on the same date as the
announcement, approving the recommended acquisition of BCA Marketplace plc by Constellation
Automotive Limited (formerly BBD Bidco Limited) to be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme
of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006.

Constellation Automotive Limited (formerly BBD Bidco Limited) is a subsidiary of Constellation Automotive

purchase of BCA Marketplace plc and its subsidiaries.

The Court sanctioned the scheme of arrangement on 5 November 2019, and the acquisition became effective
on 6 November 2019 when the Board delivered the Court Order to the Registrar of Companies. Accordingly,

Limited.

On 6 November 2019, following the scheme becoming effective, the non-executive Directors of BCA
Marketplace plc resigned from the Board of Directors. BCA Marketplace plc re-registered as a private limited
company and is subsequently referred to as BCA Marketplace Limited (the ‘Company’). The ultimate
controlling party of Constellation Automotive Group Limited (formerly BBD Parentco Limited) is TDR
