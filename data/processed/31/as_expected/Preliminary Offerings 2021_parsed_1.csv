By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements. Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. These factors include, among others: - the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic; - general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers; - the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace (as defined herein); - our dependency on a limited number of vendors; - our vulnerability to declines in demand for new or used vehicles; - a general decline in vehicle ownership or sudden changes in demand for certain types of used vehicles; - competition and our ability to successfully adapt to industry changes; - disruption in supply chains for our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division; - our dependency on certain information and technology systems, the risk of failure to effectively maintain, protect, develop or update these systems and the risk of cyber security attacks; - decrease in acceptance of or failure to improve our digital platforms and mobile applications; - damage to our inventory and vehicles held on behalf of others caused by extreme weather or other events outside our control; - complex taxation in multiple jurisdictions, in particular relating to valued-added taxes; - our ability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives; - our ability to successfully identify and acquire or integrate future acquisitions into our business; - our ability to provide financing in order to offer stock funding (trade finance) to registered dealers through BCA Partner Finance or to repossess the financed vehicles serving as collateral; - our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; - the risk of being accused of infringing on the intellectual property of third parties; - the risk of being adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations, in particular those governing the trading of used vehicles and the automotive industry in general; - the risk of unauthorized access to personal data or the processing of personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws; - laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate, some of which are unsettled and still developing; - material increases in our costs; ----- - our reliance on the strength of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness; - our ability to effectively communicate with our customers through email and other messages; - the risk of dissatisfaction with our customer service; - risks associated with currency fluctuations; - environmental, health and safety risks; - our ability to attract and retain skilled technical employees and management personnel; - our exposure to non-terminable long-term leases; - the risk of our standardized documents, contracts and terms and conditions to be held invalid; - risks associated with deficits in our pension schemes and plans; - risks associated with significant differences in accounting principles such as IFRS 16 and IAS 17; - the inclusion of certain unaudited adjusted data and other financial information not prepared in accordance with IFRS in this Offering Memorandum; and - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.” These risks and others described under the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive.

However, the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and has not been independently verified. Additionally, industry publications and such studies generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy or completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances the sources do not assume liability for such information. We have obtained certain of the market and industry data presented in this Offering Memorandum from reports produced by third-party industry specialists such as IHS, SMMT and Roland Berger. Unless for such reports that are publicly available, we have obtained consent from them to reproduce certain of their non-public data in this Offering Memorandum. We cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such data, and we have not independently verified such market data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment decision. We do, however, accept responsibility for the correct reproduction of this information. In light of the COVID 19 pandemic, the automotive industry in Europe has been adversely affected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, _a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.” Accordingly, the industry publications, surveys or_ studies by third-party data providers referred to in this Offering Memorandum may not accurately reflect certain aspects of the automotive industry in Europe as they may not contemplate the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic. Conversely, while some of the market or industry forecasts referred to in this Offering Memorandum take into account the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on the automotive industry in Europe, we cannot assure you that these forecasts will remain relevant, and will not be subject to change, as the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on the automotive industry become more apparent. Some of the information herein has been extrapolated from such market data or reports using our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements regarding the industry in which we operate and our position in this industry are based solely on our experience, internal studies and estimates, and our own investigation of market conditions. We believe that such information and statements are true and accurate, but there can be no assurance that is the case. Such information and statements have not been verified by any independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding such information, statements and any similar data presented herein, such information, statements or similar data are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors.” As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information or statements in this Offering Memorandum. Further, in this Offering Memorandum, we make statements about our market positioning relative to other companies in the vehicle remarketing business, other vehicle buying companies and other companies providing automotive services similar to ours. These statements are generally based on our experience and estimates, and our own evaluation of our competitors in the market. Where we present comparative data of certain of these peers, we have derived such data from the publicly available information of these companies or industry publications, surveys or studies by third-party data providers. We cannot guarantee that the comparative peer data that we present in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared or presented on a comparable basis to our own key operating information. We also cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such comparative peer data, and we have not independently verified or reviewed such peer data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or refraining from making, any investment decision.

The Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the applicable legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretation from the IFRS Interpretations Committee as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by our independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), and are collectively referred to as prepared in accordance with “IFRS.” Our fiscal year accounting periods typically run from the calendar day following the previous fiscal year end to a Sunday within seven days of March 31. For the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the relevant Sundays were March 28, 2021, March 29, 2020 and March 31, 2019. While the Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (from and including March 30, 2020 to and including March 28, 2021) and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 (from and including April 2, 2018 to and including March 31, 2019), respectively, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements only comprise the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 (from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020). As such, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements are not comparable to the other Consolidated Financial Statements since they only cover the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, representing the period from the incorporation date of the Parent on June 10, 2019. In addition, due to the CA Acquisition, which completed on November 6, 2019, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect our trading results during the period from April 1, 2019 to November 5, 2019. Below is an overview of the trading history covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements. - The Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of BCA Marketplace and its subsidiaries from and including April 2, 2018 to and including March 31, 2019. Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 52 weeks of trading, reflecting our results of operations prior to the CA Acquisition. - The Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent and Constellation Automotive (which were incorporated for the purpose of facilitating the CA Acquisition and, as such, are holding companies with no operations and no assets other than the shares held) from and including the date of incorporation of the Parent on June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020. During the period from June 10, 2019 to the completion date of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019, the Parent had no activities and had very limited financial results to report. Following the consummation ----- of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019, our financial results are consolidated at the Parent level. Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 145 days of trading, reflecting our results of operations after the CA Acquisition. - The Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent group from and including March 30, 2020 to and including March 28, 2021. Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 52 weeks of trading. _Application of IFRS 16_ IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and applies to the first full fiscal year commencing on or after that date. Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 since the fiscal year 2020. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective approach on April 1, 2019, with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 recognized on adoption as an adjustment to opening equity. Under this approach, comparative information for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not be comparable insofar as they relate to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases). Following the CA Acquisition, a purchase price allocation exercise was undertaken in order to identify the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired thereunder, in line with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations). IFRS 3 requires the revaluation of IFRS 16 right of use assets and lease liabilities using a revised incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). The IBR we used for these purposes increased significantly following the CA Acquisition as a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection therewith. Due to the significant change in IBR used for the valuation of right of use assets and lease liabilities resulting from the CA Acquisition, the full year IFRS 16 depreciation and interest included in our Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information represents the aggregation of (i) the pre-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and interest calculated with reference to the original, pre-CA Acquisition IBR and (ii) the post-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and interest calculated with reference to the revised, post-CA Acquisition IBR.

The financial information used in presenting the Fiscal Year 2020_ Aggregated Financial Information includes information for the Parent from June 10, 2019 (the date of incorporation of the Parent), which overlaps with information of BCA Marketplace from April 1, 2019. However, the Parent was formed on June 10, 2019 for the purposes of facilitating the CA Acquisition, which was consummated on November 6, 2019, and the Parent did not trade prior to November 6, 2019. Moreover, while both the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, they relate to different entities that have not prepared their financial information on a consistent basis. In particular, the discount rates applied in calculating the IFRS 16 related balances at original transition for the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements differ compared ----- to those used to calculate the IFRS 16 related balances following the CA Acquisition for the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We operate leading digital used vehicle marketplaces (both business to business (“B2B”) and consumer to business (“C2B”)) in the UK and B2B marketplaces in continental Europe and are a leading provider of associated automotive services, including vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. We have physical presence in 10 countries across the UK and continental Europe as well as unmatched sourcing, data, technology and logistics capabilities. As of March 28, 2021, our business comprises: - a leading B2B digital used vehicle marketplace across the UK and continental Europe, which facilitated the sale of approximately 1.5 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 1.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021; - a leading C2B digital used vehicle marketplace in the UK, WeBuyAnyCar, with sold volumes of 321,000 vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, reflecting the COVID 19 restrictions on the business that now has an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period); and - a leading automotive logistics service business in the UK, which moved more than 2.8 million vehicles in the UK in the fiscal year 2020 and 2.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021, and stored, refurbished and processed more than 950,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 675,000 in the fiscal year 2021. We estimate that for the fiscal year 2020 we came in contact with approximately one in every three vehicles in the UK (approximately 29 million touch points, of which approximately 13 million were unique vehicles out of a vehicle parc of approximately 41 million, and including approximately 24 million digital touch points). Through our digital used vehicle marketplaces (the “Marketplace”), we are a critical liquidity provider to the used vehicles market across the UK and continental Europe, matching the complex requirements of both vendors and buyers and also facilitating the purchase of individual vehicles from consumers. The Marketplace facilitates speedy disposal of high volumes of vehicles and offers a broad range of consistently graded vehicle stock, thereby providing efficiency, liquidity (i.e., fast disposal of vehicle stock) and choice. Moreover, we are the UK’s leading provider of automotive services solutions. By providing a full suite of auction and automotive services, we offer our customers solutions for almost all stages of the vehicle life-cycle, beginning as soon as the new car arrives at the port. Our scope of services provides synergistic benefits across our divisions, as our vehicle sales platforms, together with our automotive services solutions, generate vehicle and pricing data used in both our vehicle remarketing and vehicle buying operations. Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, we have accelerated our digital transition and now transact digitally almost 100% of our volumes through online channels. We integrate our digital and physical assets to provide innovative multi-service solutions, maximizing speed, intelligence and performance across our comprehensive offerings. In the fiscal year 2021, 100% (2020: 37%) of our auction volumes in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division and 96% (2020: 84%) of our auction volumes in the International Vehicle Remarketing division were transacted online, which is a testament to our successful shift towards a predominantly digital online business model moving forward. In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, we generated £253.1 million of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to £232.8 million, £204.1 million and £174.4 million in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. We operate through three main business lines: (i) the B2B Marketplace business line, which is comprised of our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, (ii) the C2B Marketplace business line, which is WeBuyAnyCar, our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, and (iii) the Automotive Services business line, which is accounted for in our Automotive Services division. ----- - B2B Marketplace: B2B Marketplace is our core business that facilitates the exchange of used vehicles between vendors and buyers through primarily digital auctions. As of March 28, 2021, our digital auctions are supported by 21 physical sites in the UK (23 as of June 1, 2021) and 30 physical sites in continental Europe at which vehicles are stored, inspected, repaired and refurbished. B2B Marketplace (which excludes WeBuyAnyCar) does not take title to the majority of vehicles that it sells, but instead serves as an agent between vendor and buyer and recognizes revenues through auction transaction fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical pre- and post- auction services such as inspections, appraisals, repairs, refurbishment, imaging, storage and handling. We also purchase vehicles directly from certain corporate vendors under outsourced remarketing contracts, whereby we directly buy our vendors’ inventory and have discretion over the remarketing channel through which we sell the vehicle. B2B Marketplace takes title to such vehicles until the time of resale and recognizes revenues for the full sale value of the vehicle less the cost of acquisition. Vehicles acquired pursuant to outsourced remarketing contracts are typically resold within 15 to 30 days of acquisition and in turn generate additional revenue above the auction fees. B2B Marketplace also includes our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, which is focused on purchasing batches of vehicles primarily from corporates in continental Europe. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division generated £90.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £116.3 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £109.4 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division sold approximately 867,000 vehicles (2020: 1,063,000 vehicles; 2019: 1,030,0000 vehicles). In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division generated £29.2 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £34.2 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £33.7 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division sold approximately 334,000 vehicles (2020: 401,000 vehicles; 2019: 388,000 vehicles). - C2B Marketplace: C2B Marketplace is our C2B vehicle buying business which operates in the UK through WeBuyAnyCar. WeBuyAnyCar purchases used vehicles directly from consumers, leveraging its proprietary online pricing quotation systems and efficient physical inspection processes to facilitate purchases from such consumers. WeBuyAnyCar has carried out a total of 2.2 million vehicle purchases since its inception in 2006, and in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar recorded more than 22 million unique visitors to its website and performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online. As of March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar operates in 357 locations across the UK, which are located within an average drive time of under 14 minutes to customers. In addition, WeBuyAnyCar offers swift services to its consumers, allowing them to obtain a quote in under 60 seconds and to then subsequently receive monies for the purchase of their vehicle within 30 minutes of the sale being concluded. C2B Marketplace remarkets the vehicles it purchases exclusively through B2B Marketplace within approximately 10 days and accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This allows us to actively manage the volumes and mix on the Marketplace, while helping to de-risk the supply of vehicles to the auction. C2B Marketplace’s consistent and growing profitability over the past years demonstrates our ability to generate “metal margin” (accounted for in our Vehicle Buying division) on C2B vehicles in addition to core auction buyer fees (accounted for in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division). Vehicles sourced via our C2B Marketplace therefore result in higher profitability per vehicle for the CA Group. Our sophisticated and proprietary pricing mechanism and real-time market data enable us to more accurately price the purchase of vehicles to generate a profitable onward sale. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Vehicle Buying division generated £44.0 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £27.7 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £24.1 million), which was predominantly generated through C2B Marketplace (i.e., WeBuyAnyCar). - Automotive Services: Automotive Services provides vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. With our refurbishment offering (which has a 250,000 yearly vehicle refurbishment capacity), we are able to bring vehicles to either wholesale standard or a “Retail Ready” standard (which refers to vehicles that are cosmetically and mechanically prepared to be immediately placed for sale to end consumers and are therefore particularly attractive to online car dealers). These standards increase prices achieved at auction and render it simpler for dealers to on-sell the vehicle to consumers. We seek to develop a relationship with vendors and endeavor to act as a one-stop shop for vehicles throughout the majority of their lifecycle, expanding our revenue ----- streams along the value chain and also positioning ourselves to be the preferred provider of remarketing services when the vehicles come off lease or roll out of the fleet. Our overall infrastructure and logistics network allow us to efficiently cover all key locations and major transport hubs in the UK. Automotive Services helps maximize the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies derived from the wide-ranging scope of services offered, benefitting both our customers as well as our own operations. Automotive Services generates revenue in the form of service fees. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, Automotive Services generated £12.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £22.6 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £19.1 million).",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Leadership across Markets,"We are a leading operator of digital used vehicle auctions in the UK and continental Europe and associated automotive services across the UK. From continental Europe, we serve over 40 countries, leveraging our ability to engage in cross-border activity across continental Europe. We believe our leading market positioning and scale enable us to better serve used car buyers and sellers compared to many of our competitors as we are able to price, source, inspect, refurbish, transport, service, market, arrange auctions and provide digital and physical services and solutions in an efficient, comprehensive and effective way. We believe our B2B Marketplace is the largest used vehicle auction operator across the UK and continental Europe combined, with approximately £10 billion in gross merchandise value in connection with sales for the fiscal year 2020. We believe that B2B Marketplace is the clear leader in the UK, having sold approximately 1.1 million vehicles in the UK in the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, as well as approximately 400,000 vehicles sold in continental Europe in the same period. These attributes mean that we can continuously meet the requirements of both professional vendors and buyers, including improved value, liquidity, efficiency and choice, and are a key part of the reason that more than 25,000 active buyers used the exchange in the fiscal year 2021. Through our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our Automotive Services offering in the UK and our brand WeBuyAnyCar, we come into contact with approximately one third of all vehicles exchanged in the UK each year. We believe that C2B Marketplace, through our brand WeBuyAnyCar, is the leading vehicle buying service in the UK, purchasing and selling over 321,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020. On an annualized basis based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period, we purchased and sold approximately 461,000 vehicles through WeBuyAnyCar. With greater than 22 million unique visitors to its website in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021 and having performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online and purchasing vehicles at 357 physical sites, each as of and for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, we believe that C2B Marketplace is significantly larger and has a significantly greater presence than any other vehicle buying service in the UK. C2B Marketplace’s leadership position is continuing to strengthen with an increase in the number of repeat customers in recent years, demonstrating consumers’ trust in the brand and satisfaction around the value attached to the vehicle disposal process. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, WeBuyAnyCar has over 100,000 Trust Pilot reviews with an average 4.6 rating. In Automotive Services, we operate one of the largest automotive vehicle movement, logistics, storage, predelivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment capability in the UK. As of March 28, 2021, we own the largest transporter fleet in the UK, comprising 901 trucks capable of providing bulk vehicle movements, thereby connecting the physical marketplace and increasing the integration between our divisions. We also offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through the process of vehicle delivery, handover and collection. In the fiscal year 2021, we moved 2.4 million vehicles (2020: 2.8 million), including 563,000 single vehicle movements, and our in-house and sub-contracted transporter fleet completed 94% of transport arranged for customers by the UK Vehicle Remarketing division. We offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through the process of vehicle delivery, handover and collection. We also operate one of the UK’s largest inspect and collect businesses with over 400,000 vehicle inspections made in the fiscal year 2021, are one of the UK’s leading new vehicle storage handling and preparation businesses and are among the UK’s leading de-fleet, refurbishment and alloy wheel businesses with more than 675,000 vehicles stored, refurbished and processed in the fiscal year 2021. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,Superior Business Model Addressing the Full Value Chain and Difficult to Replicate,"We operate under a marketplace model and benefit from self-reinforcing dynamics where each of our business lines feeds into and reinforces the others. Our business model enables us to extract intragroup efficiencies and synergies derived from operating across almost all stages of the vehicle life-cycle, at high volumes sufficient to provide a level of information, liquidity and market recognition that drives further volume growth. Our B2B Marketplace operates vehicle auctions that bring together vendors with a highly fragmented and diverse buyer base. Our large, robust and transparent digital platforms combined with our full suite of preand post-auction digital and physical value-added services provide an efficient marketplace to facilitate the exchange of used vehicles. B2B Marketplace sold approximately 1.5 million vehicles across the UK and continental Europe in the fiscal year 2020. This significant scale creates a virtuous business cycle by providing access to a wide variety and large volume of vehicles through our auctions, thereby attracting more buyers to our platform and enabling optimum pricing and quick throughput, which in turn attracts more sellers and provides more volumes. Moreover, we obtain valuable insights for our pricing engines based on the information we have available about a vehicle and its condition, color, auction sale price and bid levels. The B2B Marketplace benefits from multiple sourcing channels targeting different types of vendors. The C2B Marketplace creates a highly complementary and enhancing growth engine to that of the B2B Marketplace. The B2B Marketplace provides WeBuyAnyCar with a highly efficient route to dispose of the vehicles it purchases from consumers (typically within 10 days) and, through WeBuyAnyCar, we have the ability to purchase a greater volume and variety of vehicles, which directly helps supply the B2B Marketplace. The Vehicle Buying division provides significant volumes to the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, having accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold through the Marketplace in the UK in the fiscal year 2021. This synergistic model, which leverages WeBuyAnyCar’s market share within the framework of our wider marketplace, creates a platform which we believe would be difficult to replicate. Our ability to dynamically source used vehicles combined with our knowledge and insights on pricing and other demand side dynamics enable us to find an optimum and tailored match for buyers and sellers swiftly, which is key in driving profitability per vehicle. This is further strengthened by the additional services we offer, which increase consumer and vendor experience as well as help us generate greater profitability per vehicle. Our scaled B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace provides our pricing model with over six million relevant historic used vehicle transactions. This data enables us to accurately and efficiently price vehicles both upon sourcing and sale. This scale is further supported by our Automotive Services business line and our full suite of pre- and post-auction digital and physical value-added services. This completes the value chain allowing us to cover the full life-cycle, deepen relationships with vendors and customers and maximize profitability per vehicle. Moreover, our Automotive Services business line and our value-added services enable us to record information relating to vehicle condition, maintenance and upkeep, further contributing to the pricing model and further supporting the reliability of pricing decisions. With the launch of B2C Marketplace, outside the restricted group, we have further diversified our buyer and vendor base as cinch acts as another buyer through our auction channel, thereby generating auction fees for our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as additional income for our Automotive Services division. Furthermore, cinch also generates additional supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that are remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related _Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.”_ ----- As the scale of each of the business lines has grown and has reached greater volumes and touch points, it has contributed to the further growth of each of the business lines in a virtuous cycle. We believe we are the only operator of digital used vehicle auctions in the UK and continental Europe that offers the scale and the range of services we provide. Our advantages in scale, reputation, relationships, access to proprietary data as well as our established infrastructure and logistics network, which we believe would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation,"We believe that our scale, unique business model, reputation and robust financial policies have contributed significantly to our long-term financial resilience, attractive growth and cash flow generation profile. Despite turbulent times such as the global financial crisis of 2008, we were able to consistently maintain and grow volumes and our EBITDA metric (as defined and prepared on the basis of the accounting policies of the relevant parent entity at the time), with such metric having grown at a CAGR of 14.3% from the fiscal year ended December 2004 to fiscal year ended March 2020 and such metric divided by vehicle volumes sold in the respective trading year having grown from £37 per vehicle sold to £137 per vehicle sold over the same period, as shown in the following chart. Our business model’s resilience to market shocks can be further evidenced by our strong organic performance. For example, during the period between 2008 and 2010, we were able to grow volumes by 66,000 vehicles and the applicable EBITDA metric by £24 million in a market backdrop of reduced used car transactions in the UK, which fell from 8.3 million in 2008 to 8.0 million in 2009 before recovering to 8.1 million in 2010. Despite a market backdrop of reduced used vehicle transactions during the fiscal year 2021, our volumes between July 2020 and December 2020 were higher compared to the period between July 2019 and December 2019. In times of a consumer downturn and due to rate of loss in value generally associated with used vehicles, liquidity is of paramount importance to businesses as well as consumers. Our business is also highly cash generative, having generated £145.9 million, £175.1 million and £202.7 million of COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively. This strong cash generation is the result of our ability to grow our IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA while following a disciplined approach to capital expenditure with the majority of sites being held on long term leases (excluding WeBuyAnyCar retail locations) and most of our transporters and properties being refinanced through sale and leaseback. Adjusted cash conversion (measured by subtracting Underlying Cash CAPEX from IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA and comparing the result to IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA) was 84%, 86% and 87% in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,"Attractive, Resilient and Underpenetrated Market","We operate in the used vehicle market across the UK and continental Europe which has grown consistently since 2012, driven by a relatively stable vehicle parc churn and growing vehicle penetration rates. Vehicle ----- penetration rates are expected to continue to grow for most markets. In addition, the used car market is larger and more stable than the new car market. The chart below sets out the volumes of used car sales and new car sales in the UK between 2008 and 2020 as an example of the development of these market. The European vehicle parc has exhibited a CAGR of approximately 1.7% over 2012 to 2019, currently standing at approximately 320 million units as of 2020. As per projections from IHS, the European vehicle parc is expected to exhibit approximately 0.8% CAGR over 2021 to 2026, driven by growth in the penetration of vehicles per population. Assuming churn rates remain the same, this should support growth in the used car market. See “Industry—Overview—UK and Continental European Vehicle Parc.” In 2020, the European used car market was estimated to be worth €410 billion (Source: Roland Berger report _(Apr-21)). Significant fragmentation of buyers and vendors across the UK and continental Europe helps to_ make exchanges a critical channel for both vendors and buyers. For example, the largest used car dealership in the UK is limited to approximately 3% market share, while the largest continental European used car dealership has a market share of less than 1% (Source: IHS and ICDP). In addition, online vehicle buying services are still operating typically at low levels of overall market penetration (e.g., WeBuyAnyCar has ~4% share of total UK used vehicle sales volumes, as of 2020). The COVID 19 pandemic has also accelerated favorable structural trends affecting the markets in which we operate. In particular, consumers have recently begun placing increased emphasis on the importance of owning a car. This has been driven by a variety of different reasons, including people moving away from urban areas due to the ability to work from home and a reluctance to rely entirely on public transport. In addition, the lockdown measures imposed by governments and related closure of car dealerships has made digital channels a principal means of conducting used car auctions. In particular, by the start of 2021 almost all of our auctions were digital as the COVID 19 pandemic and related social distancing regulations accelerated our digitalization plans and encouraged the adoption of digital auctions by our customers. This digital shift allows us to reach a wider range of potential customers and has increased the amount of auctions being held, reducing our daily sales’ costs and allowing us and our customers to receive more vehicle data. Finally, we also benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push towards new technology, including tighter emission controls, encourages vehicle owners to renew their vehicles, driving more exchanges.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.5,Best-in-class Management Team with Successful Track Record of Delivery,"We operate with a management team that has significant experience in the automotive sector and has a proven track-record of executing value-accretive initiatives, whether organically or through acquisitions. Our Executive Chairman, Avril Palmer-Baunack, has over 25 years’ executive experience with leading businesses in the automotive, support services, industrial engineering and insurance services sectors, having previously served as Executive Chairman and Deputy CEO of Stobart Group and CEO of Autologic Holdings, where she joined from Universal Salvage and also held the position of CEO. Avril was the founder of Haversham Holdings plc in 2014 and led the acquisition and strategic build of the CA Group where she continues to lead as Executive Chairman. Tim Lampert, our Chief Financial Officer, joined Autologic Holdings in 1997. Tim joined Haversham Holdings plc in January 2015 for the purchase of the BCA Group from CD&R and the subsequent acquisitions prior to the group being de-listed and sold to TDR in November 2019 and has remained as CFO with the formation of the current CA Group. Together, our best-in-class management team brings over 30 years of relationships with major participants across every layer of the UK and continental European automotive sector both at the division and group levels, and more than 100 years of collective experience in the industry across four managing directors as well as legacy knowledge from some of our founders, who are still employed within our Vehicle Buying division. Thanks to its extensive experience, our management team has a proven track record of delivery, with applicable EBITDA growing from £86.0 million in the fiscal year 2014 to £200.8 million in the fiscal year 2020 ----- (as presented under “—Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation”) through, among others, the acquisition of multiple infrastructure and logistics businesses. During the same period, B2B Vehicle Volume increased from 999,000 to 1,463,000. Since the fiscal year 2014, C2B Vehicle Volume also increased from 144,000 to 321,000 vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, with an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period), reflecting the COVID 19 restrictions on the business. The track record of our senior management in delivering cost-effective organic scale growth and successfully integrating acquisitions, is one of our key strengths in a complex and continually evolving industry. In addition, our management is backed by TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm with an integrated investment and operation team of 46 professionals with an average of 15 years of relevant experience and a deep knowledge and track-record in the automotive industry via investments in LeasePlan, CarNext, EuroGarages and International Car Washing Group. The TDR Capital team, together with management, intends to continue our trajectory of consistent volume and profitability growth. We have also created a strong culture of innovation and transparency, winning a number of industry awards for technical innovation, including for BCA Dealer Pro and our website. We believe this has allowed us to maintain a high retention rate of key staff and develop a workforce that is dedicated to delivering high-quality services.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.6,Platform Ideally Positioned for Growth,"We believe our business platform is strategically positioned for growth in our markets through market share gain from the consumer to consumer (“C2C”) and part-exchange markets (whereby consumers “trade-in” their used vehicle directly to a dealer). The growth of C2B Marketplace supports the growth of our B2B channel as WeBuyAnyCar provides us with used vehicles that would otherwise go to C2C markets or partexchanges and allows us to supply a greater volume and variety of vehicles to our B2B Marketplace. We believe we can drive higher volumes through our auctions through continued market share gain and higher auction penetration in the UK and continental Europe. Our relationships with businesses such as LeasePlan or CarNext, including entering into exclusive service agreements that provide support for our multi-channel strategy, further enhance our sourcing capabilities and drive growth in the vehicle remarketing segment. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with LeasePlan.”Moreover, by leveraging our “One Europe” strategy via more seamless cross-border transactions, we believe we can create a truly pan-European B2B marketplace for future growth. In addition, COVID 19 restrictions have accelerated consumers’ willingness to adopt digital purchasing as a means to buy a car from current low levels, favoring the growth of online B2C retailers, such as cinch. Our relationship with cinch has increased supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that are remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related _Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Through cinch, we are also able to develop a B2C channel,_ which enhances our position as an end-to-end service provider. In particular, sales volumes for the B2C channel increased from approximately 4,000 in October 2020 (based on a 7-day rolling annual run-rate) to approximately 38,000 in May 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.1,Enhance our competitive advantage across the value chain as an integrated end-to-end service provider,"We plan to drive growth by increasing our B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace penetration to increase transaction volumes and scale across our geographies. The increase in scale will serve to provide even deeper access to vehicles, as well as more pricing and vehicle information, and is expected to continue to solidify our position as a leading operator of digital used vehicle auctions across the UK and the continental European countries in which we operate. We also expect to continue leveraging upon and investing in our UK and continental European network and infrastructure. ----- To further increase our scale, we intend to deepen our relationships with other participants in the used vehicle ecosystem, including OEMs, leasing companies, finance companies and dealers, to improve access to used vehicle supply and generate volumes. We plan to provide dealers with additional offerings that suit their business models, to leverage the strength of WeBuyAnyCar’s brand to capture additional supply volumes as consumers become increasingly willing to sell their vehicles through digital channels, and expand our reach to serve customers through partnerships with other B2C platforms. In order to maintain our competitive advantage across the value chain, we will leverage the close relationship between our C2B Marketplace and B2B Marketplace and work on integrating further the insights and data points we are able to collect at different stages, further supplemented by our data sharing agreement with cinch. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Multiplying our data touchpoints for vehicles entering our ecosystem will enable us to base our decisions on more precise and efficient processes and pricing input. We intend to continue to develop both our digital and physical service offerings to retain and grow the customer base and deliver enhanced profitability. By increasing the penetration of value-added services over time, we expect a compounding effect of fueling Marketplace growth by driving supply and buyer demand, as the comprehensive end-to-end solutions significantly enhance user loyalty.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategies,9.3.4,Capitalize on favorable structural industry trends to accelerate our growth,"Online penetration for sales of used vehicles has grown significantly, particularly in the UK, in recent years and the associated structural trends further accelerated during the COVID 19 pandemic. During the COVID 19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in online penetration for sales of used vehicles, as physical venues were shut for lockdown periods and social distancing restrictions and health concerns otherwise caused many consumers to avoid physical venues. Despite the recent acceleration in online penetration growth, we believe the online used car market remains underpenetrated relative to other mass retail markets such as markets for toys and games, consumer electronics and apparel. Further enhancing our digital presence will also allow us to capitalize on additional structural trends that could drive more volumes through our Marketplace and strengthen our positioning and market share on both the supply and demand sides of the ecosystem. In particular, we believe that on the demand side consumers will continue to favor used vehicles for individual transportation to avoid public transportation systems, and that more vehicles will be necessary as consumers move away from city centers to areas where public transportation is inconvenient or unavailable. On the demand side, we look to attract wider audiences via our digital auctions with no limitations linked to historical physical sites. Finally, we will seek to benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push towards new technology, including towards electric and other alternative fuel sources for vehicles, encourages vehicle owners to review their vehicles, driving more exchanges. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Recent Developments,9.4.2,Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions,"On April 22, 2021, we made a tactical acquisition of a third-party site in Corby, United Kingdom, for £12.0 million. On May 12, 2021, we completed the sale of another site in Corby, United Kingdom, for £23.4 million, having retained a lease with respect to such site and after previously purchasing the site for £19.7 million. On May 20, 2021, we acquired Rockingham (RT) Limited, Rockingham (GW) Limited and Rockingham (CP) Limited for a combined consideration of £80.0 million (the “Rockingham Acquisition”). Through the Rockingham Acquisition, we expect to be able to increase our specialist automotive reconditioning and logistics capabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Recent Developments,9.4.3,Impact of COVID 19,"Due to the unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers, leasing companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace were significantly reduced during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 with average weekly trading volume dipping to 4,000 at the start of the quarter, compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020. The changes in operating environment spurred by the COVID 19 pandemic have led us to accelerate our shift towards a fully digital online business model with increased focus on the functionality and usability of our digital platforms, as a result of which we were able to earn new contracts and increase our market share in spite of the challenging market conditions. The scale of the transformation is demonstrated by the fiscal year 2021 ending with 100% of UK auction sales having occurred online, compared to 37% in the fiscal year 2020. In addition to the enforced cessation of physical auctions in the UK, we faced restrictions such as site closures impacting the operation of the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate and recorded a reduction in the movement and inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. Our customers evolved their business models, for example by motor dealers operating a click-and-collect process during 2020 to be able to better deal with social distancing restrictions and, by August 2020, average weekly trading volumes bounced back up to 31,000. With the continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries, and the UK in particular, as well as governments lifting restrictions to public life, we expect the demand for our services to be increasing. The shift towards a more digital operation model has, to an extent, mitigated the impact of COVID 19 and the lifting of COVID 19 restrictions is expected to increase demand in the long term as dealers look to restock their inventory. _Impact on Operations_ We have been and actively continue to monitor the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our operations, and our priority has been the safety of our employees and other stakeholders. As governments in the jurisdictions where we operate introduced restrictions at the outset of the COVID 19 pandemic, we quickly ceased physical auctions and introduced social distancing and other modifications to our ways of working to remain compliant. In response to the closure of our physical auction sites, we adopted swift measures to significantly ----- reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of maximizing our liquidity position. Specifically, we adopted the following measures, which were only necessary during the time of the first lockdown in the UK during March 2020 to July 2020 and were not implemented during the subsequent second and third lockdowns: - successfully negotiated with debtors and creditors on payment terms; - put on hold all non-essential and discretionary spend within the business, including any growth, expansionary or investment capital expenditures and increased controls around the cash disbursement process, including sign off by senior members of the finance team for any payments in excess of certain reduced thresholds; - negotiated tax deferrals with HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of value-added taxes (“VAT”) and employment taxes; and - entered into arrangements with landlords to defer rent payments during the period of closure. We also made furlough arrangements for those staff unable to work in the UK where we furloughed as much as 80% of our staff at the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020 and, in parallel, applied for employee salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in continental Europe. Such schemes allow companies to place employees on paid leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s ordinary salary being partially reimbursed by the respective government. As of March 28, 2021, approximately 4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 furlough income across all jurisdictions totaled £35.5 million and rates relief totaled £8.3 million. As of March 28, 2021, remaining deferrals comprise VAT deferrals of £15.8 million, which are expected to be settled in full in instalments during the fiscal year 2022. As a result of the numerous cost-cutting and transitory measures taken at the beginning of the first lockdown in the UK, we came out of that lockdown with greater liquidity compared to our liquidity going into such lockdown. From the end of the first lockdown in the UK, we have managed to remain positive in terms of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA even in periods with government restrictions comparable with the first lockdown in the UK. Given the success of our digital offering with our clients and the level of profitability and efficiency achieved, we currently have no intention of reverting back to our previous predominantly physical auction model. _Impact on Results of Operations and Liquidity Update_ For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA were £190.1 million and £204.1 million, respectively, reflecting an estimated COVID 19 impact of £14.0 million in the fiscal year 2020. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA were £168.0 million and £232.8 million, respectively, reflecting an estimated COVID 19 impact of £64.8 million in the fiscal year 2021. For the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, we reported an operating profit of £100.2 million. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, we reported an operating loss of £224.5 million. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, we reported an operating profit of £47.4 million. We had cash and cash equivalents of £113.2 million and £247.2 million as of March 28, 2021 and March 29, 2020, respectively. We seek to maintain sufficient amounts of liquidity with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility. On April 29, 2020, we entered into the Existing Liquidity Facility Agreement, providing us with increased liquidity and capacity for future investment and vehicle buying. As of March 28, 2021, £110.7 million (2020: £2.3 million) was available for borrowing under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, in each case after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit. _Impairment Review_ As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including £938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA Acquisition. While goodwill impairment is tested annually, the COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business constituted an impairment indicator that we assessed with respect to all intangible assets as well as goodwill. The impairment review is performed on a “value-inuse” basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth rate. Any impairment charge is then recognized in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount. As a result of our impairment review conducted as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, we recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment relating to the CA Acquisition in the amount of £266.4 million in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge thereby specifically represented a change ----- in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our _Business—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain” and “Operating and Financial Review—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—COVID 19—Impairment Review.” We caution you that these impairment charges should not be_ regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding impairment charges for any future period.

See “Description of the _Notes—Additional Amounts.”_ Further Issuance of Notes . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer will be permitted to issue additional Notes. Additional Notes shall be treated, along with all other notes issued under the Indenture, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, additional Notes shall be deemed to form one series with any notes previously issued under the Indenture if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other notes. In the event that any ----- additional Notes issued after the date hereof and sold pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with any notes previously issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued notes under the Indenture. Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable series of notes previously issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. _Federal Income Tax Consequences”) considering the purchase of_ Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified. In the event additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests (as defined under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) in the Regulation S Global Notes (as defined under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) that form part of that series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (as defined under “Book-Entry, Delivery _and Form”), if any, representing Notes of that same series. Such_ a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our _Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes,” “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers” and “Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”_ Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer may be required to offer to redeem the Notes at 101% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any.

For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, this includes amortization of acquired intangible assets (£53.5 million), transaction costs relating to the CA Acquisition (£60.0 million), restructuring costs (£2.3 million), debt fees written off on refinancing (£0.4 million) and impairment of acquired intangibles relating to the longer term impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic (£266.4 million). For the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, this includes amortization of acquired intangible assets (£40.2 million), restructuring costs (£2.9 million), credit arising on a compulsory purchase order (£2.3 million), aborted transaction costs (£0.3 million) and pension costs in connection with a guaranteed minimum pension equalization adjustment (£2.2 million). (b) IFRS 16 (Leases) became effective on January 1, 2019 and we have adopted IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 recognized on adoption as an adjustment to opening equity. Under this approach, comparative information for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. For all other periods presented in the table above, we have made IFRS 16 adjustments representing the removal of IAS 17 operating lease costs previously reported within cost of sales and operating costs. Total financial indebtedness (excluding finance leases borrowings under the Receivables Facility) as presented under “Capitalization” excludes our financial lease obligations. (c) Represents the add back of start-up costs made in cinch, which was sold to an affiliate of a parent company of the Parent in September 2020. (d) For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£2.0 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£43.9 million) with the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£44.5 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£66.2 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by adding back an amount of £11.3 million (based on management forecasts using operating results for March 2020 immediately prior to lockdowns, reflecting restrictions on operating activities due to COVID 19) and an amount of £2.7 million (representing provisions relating to bad debt and inventory). For the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, no adjustments relating to COVID 19 were made.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.1,"The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.","In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID 19”) was identified in Wuhan, China. This COVID 19 outbreak has since spread and grown globally, including in each of the countries in which we operate, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Although the ultimate severity and impact of the COVID 19 pandemic remains uncertain, the COVID 19 pandemic and measures taken to combat it have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on the economy in the countries in which we operate and the automotive industry as a whole. The measures taken to combat COVID 19 include restrictions on public life, curfews, forced temporary business closures (including the closure of significant elements of our business) and lockdowns as well as social distancing protocols and the general advice to stay at home given the health risks associated with COVID 19. As a result, all aspects of our business have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially negatively impacted. In the used vehicle market, car registration agencies and car dealerships were temporarily closed, car dealers sought to reduce their inventory and some consumers chose to delay or abandon car purchases. Due to the unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers, leasing companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace, particularly at physical auction and logistics sites were significantly impacted during the fiscal year 2021 with average weekly trading volume dipping to 4,000 at the start of the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021, compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020. In a number of countries our physical auctions and other operating sites have been required to close as a result of government legislation, as have many WeBuyAnyCar sites for periods of varying length. Interruptions to the businesses of our customers (including OEMs, leasing companies, dealers and fleet providers) resulted in unpredictable and reduced volumes of vehicles being handled by our Automotive Services division and a negative impact on trading performance. A significant proportion of our workforce (such as those involved in the physical movement of vehicles) cannot work remotely and potentially face additional risks as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. In addition, some of our sites are visited by customers as part of their normal operations. We cannot guarantee that measures we take in order to limit the risks posed to such individuals will be sufficient and we may be subject to potential litigation or enforcement action as result of staff or customers alleging that our working practices are unsafe in this regard. Such litigation or enforcement action could result in material financial cost and damage to our reputation and brands. On July 10, 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we proactively and successfully negotiated certain covenant waivers with respect to certain of our existing debt facilities in order to mitigate the anticipated effects of the COVID 19 pandemic. These waivers were extended on January 22, 2021. However, a prolonged negative impact due to the COVID 19 pandemic or other factors may adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants included in the Senior Facilities Agreement or any other similar agreement, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully negotiate the covenant waivers with our lenders in such an event. The breach of a financial or other covenant or the failure to meet any of the obligations under our ----- financing agreements governing our debt may result in a default or event of default under such agreements, which in turn could result in a number of adverse consequences, including cross-defaults, the acceleration of the outstanding amounts requiring immediate repayment of the related debt in part or in whole, significant increases in interest rates and other financing and reputational costs. There is also no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. The COVID 19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. It cannot be assured that conditions in the credit lending, capital and other financial markets will not deteriorate as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained or expensive, or that the credit or capital markets will be available in the future to fund our obligations. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or make such debt unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. If we are unable to access the credit or capital markets in the longer term, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our ability to carry out growth and business development initiatives would be limited, thereby potentially limiting our future growth opportunities. We also carry significant intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including £938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA Acquisition. Pursuant to current accounting rules, we are required to assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends. If such events were to occur, the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we would be required to record an impairment charge. The COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business initially constituted an impairment indicator that we assessed and, accordingly, we recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment of £266.4 million in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge represented a change in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Summary—Recent _Developments—Impact of COVID 19—Impairment Review” and “Operating and Financial Review—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—COVID 19—Impairment Review.”_ As a matter of ordinary business operations, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our buyer finance services, BCA Partner Finance. The negative economic impact of the COVID 19 pandemic may increase such risk. While we maintain a well-established credit scoring matrix it cannot be assured that buyers repay their debt owed to us on a widespread and systemic basis over an extended period of time. We have participated in available government schemes designed to support businesses negatively impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic. These schemes include mechanisms to allow companies to place employees on paid leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s ordinary salary being partially reimbursed by the respective government. In the UK, we have furloughed as much as 80% of our staff at the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020, such number subsequently dropping below 60% by June 2020, and as of March 28, 2021, approximately 4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In addition, we have also applied for and made use of employee salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in the UK and continental Europe. While we are carefully tailoring our use of these COVID 19 prompted measures to ensure retention of the necessary knowledge and expertise to support the business going forward, as a result of these measures, there could be a loss of institutional knowledge, experience, and/or expertise which could limit our ability to manage the business effectively, react to external developments, retain vendors and make necessary technological developments. Similarly, these measures may negatively impact the morale of our workforce, leading to voluntary departures of additional employees. In addition, there can be no guarantee that similar schemes will be available in the future in the event of further COVID 19 or similar public health related disruption. In the event of future disruption and in the absence of similar support schemes, related costs may be significantly higher than experienced during the previous periods of COVID 19 restrictions with a negative impact on our ability to operate. The overall impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. These factors include, but are not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and the ultimate severity of the COVID 19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted and the ----- length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that the COVID 19 pandemic will not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To the extent the COVID 19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” including those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes. In addition, as a consequence of the significantly increased volatility and instability experienced during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, it is difficult for us to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future macroeconomic cycles. A decline in demand due to adverse macroeconomic conditions may also have an adverse impact on the business of the automotive industry and require us to substantially increase the amounts of financial assistance, to carry on our operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.2,"We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers.","We operate in the UK and in a number of continental European countries while selling vehicles to buyers in a wider geographic area. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by global economic conditions, such as instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, interest rates, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges such as uncertain or changing political or regulatory environments. A potential prolonged economic slowdown in the UK and continental Europe resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic poses a risk to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and the communities in which they and we operate. The current status of the COVID 19 pandemic around the world remains serious, and while there is cause for optimism (with the continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries and the UK in particular), there can be no assurance that vaccinations are effective and reopening will not be reversed in response to a resurgence in COVID 19 outbreaks. Negative economic developments, including due to global or local recessions, higher unemployment rates, diminished levels of consumer confidence, declines in income levels and the loss of wealth, have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in decreased demand in the automotive industry. The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic may be associated with further or continued decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels which may negatively impact the demand for vehicles from consumers and business users. Since we rely on strong demand for the used vehicle market, we are particularly dependent on consumer confidence and spending power, two factors that are strongly influenced by overall economic conditions. Moreover, national and local governments may impose limitations and restrictions on the operation of our business in response to any future COVID 19 resurgence, and the impact of those restrictions may have a detrimental effect on our ability to operate (including but not limited to social distancing and other health and safety related measures, and possibly preventing or restricting some elements of our business from trading at all). Compliance with such regulations requires the application of financial and human resources and increases costs to the potential detriment of our business. Failure by us to comply, or the perception of non-compliance, with any such regulations may lead to enforcement action against us with possible financial costs and could also damage our brands and reputation. Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, adverse economic conditions in the countries where we have operations may negatively impact our financial results, and that of our vendors and buyers. Activity levels in the automotive industry can be affected by such factors as the availability of consumer credit, the growth of average wages and the level of unemployment, among others, which in turn could impact the volume of vehicles we handle. In addition, if OEMs in the UK were to experience declining new vehicles sales, the used vehicle market could in turn be negatively impacted, which would affect our Vehicle Buying division and Vehicle Remarketing division. Due to the relative size of our UK operations, compared to our operations in continental Europe, we are more exposed to changes in the UK economic environment. ----- The wider geopolitical environment in the UK and continental Europe is also beyond our control. Our business and operations are adversely affected by unstable or deteriorating international trade conditions. For example, the withdrawal of the UK from the EU effective December 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) have resulted in substantial regulatory uncertainty regarding international trade and trade policy. Moreover, our international operations are subject to risks associated with the prevailing local political, economic and regulatory climate. For instance, it may be more difficult in certain jurisdictions for us to enforce contracts, collect receivables, terminate labor contracts, receive dividends and transfer funds. In addition, we may face risks associated with unexpected changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in relation to complexity of domestic and international customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on foreign trade or investment, currency exchange and capital controls, nationalization and expropriation and cancelation of our contractual relationships without full compensation for loss. Any of the aforementioned changes to general economic, political and regulatory conditions, and in particular any changes in the regulatory environment and potentially adverse tax consequences as a result thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.3,We are dependent on the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace.,"Our business is vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply of vehicles to our sales platforms, including our digital and physical auction sites (together, the “Marketplace”), which in turn depends on a variety of factors. For example, declines in demand in the automotive industry resulting from adverse macroeconomic conditions have historically adversely impacted used vehicle trade-ins to dealers, which has in turn reduced our auction volumes, as dealers represent a large proportion of our vendors. In addition, the supply of vehicles from corporate vendors, including contract hire, leasing and finance companies, can also be affected by adverse economic conditions if corporate vendors reduce the size of, or delay the renewal of, their fleets during an economic downturn. OEMs have also in the past reduced the number of vehicles manufactured during periods of macroeconomic decline, which, over time, can adversely affect the number of used vehicles in the market and thus the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace. Additionally, legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace. Furthermore, the supply of vehicles could also decrease if our vendors elect to sell their vehicles directly to our buyers, including private consumers. If, as a result of the foregoing factors or for any other reason, the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our ability to provide a large, attractive offering of used vehicles within our Vehicle Remarketing division depends on the number and quality of used vehicles we are able to purchase through WeBuyAnyCar, and the public’s willingness to tender their vehicles to our Vehicle Buying division. There can be no assurance that the supply of suitable vehicles at competitive prices will be sufficient to meet our needs and to continue to grow our offering. In addition, difficulties in sourcing a suitable inventory of used vehicles may arise, among others, due to errors from the proprietary pricing model we use to calculate purchase prices within WeBuyAnyCar, or a failure to adjust our pricing model in order to meet the most recent market trends. If we are unable to source a suitable inventory at competitive prices as a result of any of these factors, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.4,We depend on a limited number of vendors for a substantial portion of the vehicles we sell.,"Historically, a limited number of vendors have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of the vehicles sold through the Marketplace, notwithstanding the fact that WeBuyAnyCar (which sources vehicles from individual consumers) contributed 35% of all vehicles we remarketed in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, thereby partially de-risking our supply. The majority of sales arrangements with our vendors do not guarantee the provision of a minimum number of vehicles to us. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance that our largest vendors will continue to provide us with a supply of vehicles, or that we would be able to replace the volumes of vehicles provided by these vendors were they to materially decrease. In addition, if one or more of our vendors’ financial condition deteriorates, or if a vendor were to restructure its operations, our loss of access to the vendor’s vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.5,Our business is vulnerable to declines in demand for used vehicles.,"If the demand for new or used vehicles decreases in the markets in which we operate, the volumes of, and the prices paid for, vehicles sold through the Marketplace may decrease, which in turn could reduce our margins. Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, no assurance can be given that ----- such market remains stable in times of economic downturn. A decline in demand from our buyers could be caused by a variety of factors, including adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as stagnant growth, a decline in disposable income or consumer confidence and restricted access to consumer financing. High fuel prices may also disproportionately affect demand for vehicles with poor fuel-efficiency and lead to a reduction in the miles driven per vehicle, which could affect the number of vehicles sold through the Marketplace. Additionally, rising interest rates may depress sales of new or used vehicles because many purchasers finance their purchases. Furthermore, adverse changes in the credit quality of our buyers, arising from macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, could also lead to lower sales, as well as increase our counterparty risk. Any reduction in demand for used vehicles caused by these or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.6,We may be adversely affected by a general decline in vehicle ownership or sudden changes in demand for certain types of used vehicles.,"Demand for our used vehicles may be adversely affected by trends that lead to an overall decline in demand for vehicles. For example, environmental concerns surrounding certain types of vehicle (older diesel vehicles, for example) or a growing share of younger people choosing not to purchase or lease their own vehicles, opting for ride-hailing services, ride-sharing services, car rental services and public transportation instead. These trends may continue or even intensify, in particular as urbanization continues and a growing share of the population migrates to major cities. As a result, overall demand for vehicles, including for used vehicles, may decline, which could adversely affect our business prospects. Furthermore, demand for certain types of used vehicles may suddenly decline due to the introduction of innovative technologies for new vehicles (e.g., autonomous driving systems). There is no guarantee that we will be able to quickly source more innovative vehicles as it may take several years before they become available in the used vehicle market. Consequently, sourcing and selling such vehicles may be more complex. Likewise, actions by OEMs or car dealers may have a significant impact on demand in the used vehicle market. If these parties decide to offer greater incentives for the sale of new vehicles (e.g., discounts or attractive financing), or generally lower prices for new vehicles, this could make buying a new vehicle more attractive. As a result, prices for used vehicles and our associated fees may decline. Prices may also decline due to insolvencies of rental car companies or other companies with large fleets or an increased number of returns of leased vehicles, which could result in oversupply. Conversely, any significant increase in market prices due to a scarcity of used vehicles could impact our ability to source desirable inventory at acceptable prices and our volume turnaround, which could have a material adverse effect on our continued growth and margins.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The Vehicle Buying division and the Vehicle Remarketing division face competition from other vehicle buying and remarketing companies both in the UK and continental Europe. In the Automotive Services division, we face competition from a broad range of competitors. Due to the increasing use of the Internet and other technology as remarketing and distribution channels, we also face increasing competition from online wholesale and retail vehicle selling platforms as well as from our own vendors when they sell directly to end consumers rather than remarket vehicles through the Marketplace. Increased competition could result in reduced profitability and/or loss of market share. Our future success may be impacted by our ability to respond to evolving industry trends, changes in buyer and vendor requirements and new technologies. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources, may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry dynamics and changes in vendor or buyer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of new or emerging services and technologies. If we are unable to compete successfully or to successfully adapt to industry changes, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

These services expose us to supply chain risks, as we are dependent on the availability of certain automotive parts and skilled labor ----- to ensure that vehicles can move seamlessly along the automotive value chain, from collection through inspection, repairs and onwards sale. Any reduction, or any delays or disruptions, in the supply chains of the materials and components used by our Vehicle Remarketing division or Automotive Services division could result in a significant disruption to our operations and affect our ability to meet our commitments. Similarly, the lack of skilled labor to undertake inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage as well as handling services could result in a significant disruption to our operations. These disruptions may result from many reasons, including increasing demands for certain automotive parts, closures of suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical failures or breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions, political upheaval, competition for skilled labor as well as logistical complications resulting from severe weather or other natural disasters and delayed customs processing. Financial difficulties of our major suppliers may also lead to delays in the delivery of materials and components. The unavailability of any automotive parts or skilled labor required to deliver our inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage and handling services could cause our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division to incur significant delays. The risk of disruptions in the supply of materials and components that we use is heightened due to the greater political, economic and social instability created by Brexit, which may lead to further complications with respect to customs processing and/or may lead to limited transportation infrastructure and difficulties in finding alternative reliable, costefficient and qualified suppliers that can freely move between the UK and continental Europe. Brexit and the related restrictions on free movement of labor across the English Channel has also heightened the risk that skilled labor may be unavailable.

It is therefore essential that key systems, software and hardware are operational at all times. Substantially all of our remarketing buyers access our systems via websites and/or mobile applications to view vehicles coming to auction prior to participating in our auctions, and to participate in the various types of auctions and Bid Now/Buy Now sales themselves. In addition, our customers also use WeBuyAnyCar’s online vehicle pricing quotation system to obtain a valuation of their vehicle. We are therefore reliant on the operation of WeBuyAnyCar’s online platform, as well as a number of mobile applications, which offer vehicle search functions, bidding features and access to live information such as pricing, vehicle condition, and individual lot/auction timings. Our digital services are accessed by a large number of users, often at the same time, and if user traffic increases, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. The business is also reliant on the systems that power the Automotive Services division’s remote operations, such as transporters, inspect and collect operatives, appraisers and imaging. We rely on a large range of computer and other information systems which are essential to our operations and which became even more important during the COVID 19 pandemic, when our operating model shifted towards an online business. Accordingly, the continued and uninterrupted performance of those systems, along with their development and implementation, are vital factors in the operation of our business. We depend on our technical infrastructure for all aspects of the day-to-day management of our business and the delivery of our services. Any material disruption to the operation of such infrastructure, including as a result of legislative and regulatory changes regarding online sales and e-commerce, may materially and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors or physical or electronic break-ins, or other factors could affect the security or availability of our products and services on our websites or mobile applications and prevent or inhibit the ability of vendors and buyers to access our services. Electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks continue to increase in both prevalence and sophistication throughout the digital world with the potential to corrupt, affect or destroy key systems and data, including the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. Given that techniques used in these break-ins and attacks change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, it may be impossible to properly secure our systems. In addition, technical advances or a continued expansion and increased complexity of our digital offering could increase the likelihood of security breaches. The risk of electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also of those of our customers, employees, contractors, business partners, and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. ----- Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our customers and its customers. Furthermore, these risks will increase as we continue to shift of our operating model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Problems with the reliability, availability or security of our systems and digital service offerings could harm our reputation, result in a loss of vendors or buyers or necessitate additional costs, fines or penalties, any of which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Certain vendors, as a condition of operating through us, audit our information and technology systems. These audits may require significant management time to address and could result in costly changes to information and technology systems as a condition of continued operation. The loss of the supply of vehicles from a vendor or the cost of changes to our information and technology systems following an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Robust back office systems, including auction information systems, are also critical to our ability to attract visitors to our websites. These systems are also imperative for the operation of our website and mobile applications, pricing, third-party data feeds, customer service, internal and external communications, procurement, logistics, administration and financial reporting. In addition, we are dependent on certain third-party information and technology systems, particularly with respect to payment processing, vehicle licensing checks and fraud detection. In particular, we face liability risks in connection with online credit card fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems, despite using market-standard protocols designed to ensure enhanced security and strong identification for our customers when they use their debit or credit cards for vehicle purchases. The failure or unavailability of any of our information and technology systems to detect such type of fraud or other errors with respect to payment processing or vehicle licensing checks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Much of our physical information and technology infrastructure (including servers, website hosting, database storage and wide area networks) is supplied by service providers via managed services contracts. Technical or other service problems faced by our managed service providers could adversely affect the experience of our vendors and buyers. Any financial or operational difficulties faced by our managed service providers or any of the third-party service providers with whom they contract may have adverse effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Furthermore, any disruption of the distribution channels or networks used by our mobile applications could adversely affect the ability to access or update our mobile applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continued innovation and ability to provide features that make our websites and mobile applications user-friendly, particularly through the development of specific software and applications under a variety of new platforms and operating systems, which are generally expected by users to offer the same features or flexibility and to be as easily and intuitively operated as desktop interfaces. As technology improves and as our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, which may require substantial financial, operational and technical resources.

We are liable for the vehicles we own (the majority of which are purchased through the Vehicle Buying division) and, in many cases, we are liable for the vehicles supplied by vendors for auction through the Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as when we collect and deliver vehicles through our logistics services. Extreme weather, such as hail storms, fire and flooding, which has in the past damaged vehicles in our possession, natural disasters (such as extreme precipitation or extreme temperature) or other catastrophic events (such as terrorism and large-scale accidents) may adversely affect our physical facilities or damage vehicles awaiting sale or vehicles generally stored by us. Such risks are particularly prevalent in respect of our open air facilities. In addition, there is no assurance that used vehicles in our inventory will be properly protected (e.g., against theft or vandalism). This may result in an increase in costs, delay or cancelation of auction sales, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Our failure to meet vendors’ or buyers’ demands in such situations could further adversely affect our reputation, reduce customer satisfaction, damage relationships with both vendors and buyers and result in a loss of future business. We maintain insurance cover for risks including property damage, business interruption, employers and public liability, as well as for certain other claims consistent with customary practice in the industry in which we operate. However, claims not covered by our insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage may arise, such as from a natural disaster, theft or other causes outside our control. Moreover, we may be unable in future periods to obtain insurance coverage on acceptable terms, without substantial premiums increase or at all, particularly if there is deterioration in our claim experience history.

Because of the complex interplay between our business and the various taxation regimes to which we are subject, the provision made for taxes in the accounts involves a significant amount of judgement and uncertainty regarding the interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to existing tax laws or tax reporting obligations, or the introduction of new tax laws or obligations (for instance with regards to online sales), in any of these jurisdictions could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks associated to unforeseen changes to existing tax laws or tax reporting obligations are compounded by the uncertainty created by Brexit and legislatives changes in connection thereto (see “—We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in _the countries in which we have operations and customers”) and the shift of our operating model towards an_ online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will _continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”)._ Additionally, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in many countries involving VAT and other indirect taxes. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are responsible for collecting any VAT amounts due on the vehicles we sell, and we rely on our vendors to provide accurate and complete information relating to the VAT status of each vehicle to enable us to calculate the amount of any VAT due. We also rely on purchasers of our vehicles at auction to provide accurate information regarding their residency in order to assess appropriate treatment of VAT for sales invoices. If a vendor or buyer provides incorrect or incomplete VATrelated information, or if we fail to implement or fully comply with local VAT rules and regulations, we may be exposed to VAT claims and fines from relevant authorities. In the ordinary course of our business, we are frequently subject to VAT and other tax audits by relevant authorities throughout Europe, and these audits can relate to matters that arose many years in the past.

These initiatives are focused on enhancing our competitive advantage as an integrated end-to-end ----- service provider, further expanding internationally, strengthening our infrastructure and logistics network, capitalizing on favorable industry trends, continuing to enhance our data capabilities and improving our operational efficiencies, cash flow and leverage. These initiatives will require extensive planning and management attention and entail substantial execution risk. Notably, our strategy is focused on meaningful growth of vehicle volumes transaction through our marketplaces. Such volume growth requires simultaneous success in several different domains including: (i) commercial success with vendors, so they supply higher volume to our marketplaces; (ii) maintained data leadership in order for the marketplaces to provide efficient liquidity to all participants; (iii) digital product leadership to make our integrated services offering the most relevant in the market; and (iv) best-in-class logistics and services footprint to deliver an integrated end-to-end digital and physical service. Failure to maintain our competitive advantages in any of these dimension could have a material could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new digital platforms will also require substantial IT support and infrastructure and, as we grow, we will need to ensure our back-office IT systems are integrated across our operations. With respect to the Vehicle Buying division, our strategy places particular importance on expanding WeBuyAnyCar’s operations. However, there can be no assurance that WeBuyAnyCar will continue to grow in the UK. As we seek to expand car buying into new markets, we may also need to comply with unfamiliar regulatory regimes. In addition, because car buying involves purchasing vehicles and holding them as inventory until their sale (in contrast to our UK Vehicle Remarketing division and our International Vehicle Remarketing division, which do not include WeBuyAnyCar’s operations, and do not take title to the majority of vehicles that they sell), the expansion of such operations may increase our cash requirements and inventory risk, thereby increasing our depreciation and impairment charges. Similarly, recalls by OEMs are a common occurrence and have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. In case of such recalls, we may have to temporarily remove the affected used vehicles from our inventory and may be unable to liquidate such inventory in a timely manner or at all. The same may occur if regulatory changes (e.g., the introduction of stricter emission standards) prevent consumers from driving certain used vehicles in cities or at all, consequently reducing demand for the affected vehicles. If we are unable to sell the vehicles purchased at an appropriate price, or at all, we may incur write-downs or our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, the implementation of our strategic initiatives in certain international markets may not produce the benefits achieved in markets where we already have established operations. Each new market that we enter will require us to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with that new market, which may entail finding new partners, hiring and training new staff with local language skills and an understanding of the local market, and learning the customs and cultures of the new country. These processes can be difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Additionally, our business strategies may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business. Our inability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives could result in, among others, the loss of clients and personnel, the loss of market share, the impairment of assets and inefficiencies from operating in new markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Successful integration of future acquisitions will depend on our ability to effect any necessary changes in operations or personnel resulting from the acquisition. Acquisitions may also expose us to new risks, including difficulties in integrating and operating businesses in countries that are new to us, difficulties integrating acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, employment or other issues or expenses arising out of an acquisition, potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by acquisitions, including pressure on management’s time and resources, or an acquired business’ failure to meet our expectations or business plans.

Failure to take appropriate information security measures could result in personal data being processed in an unauthorized or potentially unlawful manner. The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 significantly change the data protection landscape in the EU and the UK. Such laws and regulations strengthen the rights of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes with associated response plans. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is relatively complex. We, or the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in the future into employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Moreover, our customers frequently require that we demonstrate our compliance with data protection laws as they deem appropriate with respect to any personal data we may process on their behalf. Failure to demonstrate such compliance to their satisfaction may result in action including, but not limited to, the loss of contracts with such customers. The failure to comply with our obligations under applicable data protection laws could potentially result in us being issued with undertakings, enforcement notices (the failure with which to comply would be a criminal offence) and fines, as well as suffer damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.20,"We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate, some of which are unsettled and still developing.","Our operations are subject to compliance with extensive laws and regulations, both in the UK and across continental Europe, including, but not limited to, laws relating to vehicle brokerages and auctions, currency ----- reporting obligations, data protection, competition, consumer protection, advertising, the Internet, property usage, money laundering, bribery and taxation. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, liability to third parties, license revocation and reputational damage, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as well as our profitability. Furthermore, if laws and regulations are not enforced equally against our competitors in a particular market, our compliance with laws and regulations may put us at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis non-complying competitors. Changes in laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to us may also increase the costs of providing services or limit our ability to expand our service offerings, any of which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. More stringent laws or regulations may impose additional burdens on us, and it is difficult to predict the impact of new or amended laws or regulations to which we may become subject. There is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws, regulations and court decisions pertaining to the Internet and online commerce, which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, local regulations impose restrictions on or prohibit credit and debit card operations in order to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. The growth and development of online commerce has also prompted calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts by regulatory authorities that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally. Because of our relatively large physical property portfolio, we are also subject to the risk that we could be compelled by government authorities to sell or vacate the property on which we operate or to make significant changes to the operations and activities we undertake to comply with changes to planning regulations. Furthermore, because of our international operations, the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another, thereby making compliance more difficult and increasing the costs of conducting our business. In addition, if we were to expand into new countries, we could face legal, regulatory or tax requirements with which we are not familiar. Compliance with current or future laws and regulations to which we are subject could place significant demands on our resources, as well as subject us to unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.21,Our costs could materially increase.,"Our largest cost is payroll, driven primarily by the number of our employees and their wages and salaries. If relationships with our employees were to deteriorate, we could experience strikes, unionization efforts or other types of conflicts, which could lead to interruption to our operations and increased costs. In addition, payroll costs could increase because we compete with other service providers to recruit and retain skilled employees, which has become more challenging as a result of Brexit and the related restrictions on free movement of labor across the English Channel. High employment levels can lead to scarcity of staff and a corresponding increase in the wages and salaries necessary to attract and retain suitable employees may be indispensable in the future. In addition, future legislative changes relating to the minimum wage could necessitate an increase in payroll costs. We also undertake significant marketing activities, in particular for our Vehicle Buying division, and any increase in television, radio and Internet advertising rates could increase our operating expenses. Moreover, we incur significant fuel, power and other consumable supply costs across our operations that may escalate and there can be no assurance that our costs will not grow at a faster rate than our revenue. If we are unable to pass on future cost increases to our vendors or buyers, our operating profit margin could be adversely affected, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.22,"We rely on the strength of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness may increase.","Our brands, corporate image and reputation constitute a significant part of our value proposition. Our success over the years has largely depended on our ability to develop our brands and corporate image as a leading vehicle auction company in the UK and continental Europe. In addition, the WeBuyAnyCar consumer brand in the UK is particularly important to the Vehicle Buying division, and the development of the WeBuyAnyCar brand historically has required significant financial expenditure, particularly on marketing and advertising. ----- In order to maintain WeBuyAnyCar’s reputation, we have to be able to respond to changes in marketing and advertising rules, consumer sentiment and consumer preferences, all of which may change rapidly and as a result of factors outside of our control. Our brands could be adversely affected by the actions of other companies that damage the reputation of our industry as a whole, in particular in relation to the Vehicle Buying division, as several companies operate under names similar to WeBuyAnyCar’s name. As we seek to expand our operations, maintaining and increasing the awareness and perceived quality of our brands and corporate image will be important to attract and expand our vendor and buyer base. We use Internet search engines, in particular Google, to generate traffic to our websites. The purchase of keywords consists of anticipating words and terms consumers will use to search on Internet search engines and then bidding on those words and terms in the applicable search engine’s auction system. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be adversely affected. Our positioning on a search engine’s search results depends on algorithms designed by the search engine provider and are based on various criteria including, in particular, the historical level of traffic on our websites. As a result, if search engine providers change their search algorithms in a manner that is competitively disadvantageous to us, our ability to generate traffic to our websites would be harmed. Furthermore, our mobile applications rely on app stores operated by third parties, in particular Apple, which make mobile applications available for download. The structure of these app stores may change and third-party operators may decide to exclude our mobile applications from their offering (e.g., if we do not agree to changes in terms and conditions), which may adversely affect the availability of our mobile applications. These operators may also charge us fees to list our mobile applications for download, which could adversely affect our margins or result in us discontinuing to offer our mobile applications through third-party app stores. We will continue to invest in, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as well as other efforts to preserve and enhance customer awareness of our brands. In particular, we expect to spend significant amounts on television, radio and Internet advertising to support WeBuyAnyCar, which is a purely customer brand. There can be no assurance, however, that our advertising campaigns will successfully maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands. Advertising campaigns may be ineffective and may even have adverse effects on website traffic and brand perception as a result of factors potentially out of our control, such as changes in consumer preferences and regulatory reforms impacting advertising and marketing rules. Even if we are successful in our branding efforts, significant costs are incurred in order to develop, deploy and update our advertising campaigns, and as a result our efforts may not be cost-effective because, among others, assumptions regarding required customer acquisition costs and resulting revenue prove to be incorrect. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our current marketing channels will continue to be effective, permissible and generally available to us in the future. For television marketing, the program during which we broadcast our commercials may not achieve the anticipated number of viewers. For our online marketing, the relevant partners may be unable to deliver the anticipated traffic to our website and mobile applications. In particular, the popularity of social media channels tends to fluctuate, making it difficult to predict which channels are best suited to reach a mass audience. Moreover, any negative publicity may be accelerated through social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) due to its immediacy and accessibility as a means of communication. Social media and websites immediately publish posts from users, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. New and existing customers value readily available information concerning digital offerings and often act on such posts without further investigation or authentication. Allegations against us may be posted on social media, in Internet chat rooms or on blogs or websites by anyone on an anonymous basis. Any negative publicity, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, or the failure to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner could damage our reputation, diminish the strength of our brands, undermine the trust and credibility we have established, have a negative impact on our ability to attract new or retain existing customers and require us to spend significant time and money to address such negative publicity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Our emails may, however, be shown as “spam”or given a lower priority, which could reduce the likelihood of addresses opening or responding positively to them. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on, or charge for the delivery of, emails and other messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing additional requirements, could impair our ability to communicate with customers. If we are not able to use unpaid marketing tools in the form of emails or other messages efficiently, this could impair our marketing efforts or make them more expensive if we have to increase spending on paid marketing channels. ----- Furthermore, malfunctions of our email and messaging services could result in erroneous messages being sent and customers no longer wanting to receive any messages from us. Furthermore, our process to obtain consent from visitors to our website and users of our mobile applications to receive newsletters and other messages from us and to allow us to use their data may be insufficient or invalid or become so as result of regulatory or legislative changes.

The satisfaction of our customers depends in particular on the effectiveness of our customer service, in particular our ability to deal with complaints (e.g., with respect to the quality of used vehicles, technical problems, payment and shipping, defects and invoicing) in a timely and satisfying manner. Any unsatisfactory response or lack of responsiveness (e.g., due to interruptions of our hotlines) could reduce customer satisfaction and loyalty and therefore adversely affect our revenue and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

However, we conduct operations in the UK and continental Europe, as a result of which approximately 11% of our revenue in the fiscal year 2021 was denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, with the significant majority of this denominated in euro. Our results of operations may therefore be affected by both the transaction and translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when we incur costs or earn revenue in a currency other than the pound sterling. For example, because we report in pound sterling, our consolidated results would be adversely affected by the depreciation of the euro relative to the pound sterling, as this would result in reduced euro-denominated earnings, an effect which could increase were our European operations to expand, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to additional taxation as a result of any foreign exchange gain arising in respect of the interest on our euro-denominated indebtedness, which could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.26,"Environmental, health and safety risks could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.","We operate from multiple locations across the UK and continental Europe. Large numbers of vehicles are stored and prepared for sale at these sites, and during that time releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. In addition, members of the public and our employees come into close contact with vehicles moving on or around our sites. Furthermore, our employed and contracted drivers collect and deliver large numbers of vehicles across both the UK and continental Europe and our fleet of vehicle transporters carries large numbers of vehicles annually. Consequently, our operations are subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as regulations requiring adequate precautions to prevent injuries arising from collisions and impacts with vehicles moving within our locations and on public roads. For example, governments increasingly introduce low emission zones in certain geographical areas, where the most polluting vehicles are regulated and vehicles with higher emissions, including vehicles in support of the Automotive Services division, cannot enter, thereby limiting our operations. We may incur expenditures relating to accidents causing injury to individuals, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could also subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.27,Failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees and management personnel could harm our business.,"Our success is in part driven by the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and by the efforts, ability and experience of key members of our management staff. The members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the industry in which we operate and have skills that are critical to the ----- operation of our business, including their relationships with, and understanding of the requirements of, the relevant regulatory authorities in the industry in which we operate. We have implemented policies and remuneration designed to retain and properly incentivize management; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain qualified candidates to replace or succeed members of senior management, should the need arise. The loss of services of any of our management staff could significantly weaken our management expertise and our ability to deliver our services efficiently and effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Because we operate in a rapidly changing and increasingly digitalized market, our success also depends to a significant extent upon our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified technical personnel. Our employees have specialized knowledge that is in high demand, and competition for suitably qualified individuals with the relevant technical expertise in our industry and in the locations in which we operate is intense and may further increase as more vehicle auction companies in the UK and continental Europe shift their operating model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. We have a dedicated team of data scientists and have been able to utilize our data pool to develop highly accurate pricing capabilities based on age, mileage and condition, which permit us to maximize margins in real time. If we are unable to identify, attract, develop, motivate, adequately compensate and retain well-qualified and engaged personnel, or if existing highly skilled and specialized personnel leave us and successors or adequate replacements are not readily available, we may not be able to manage our operations effectively, which could cause us to suffer delays in new service offerings, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our customers’ demands, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The difficulties in identifying, attracting and retaining suitable management personnel and employees are exacerbated as a result of Brexit and free movement complications in relation thereto, which make travel between the UK and continental Europe more difficult. In addition, we bear the risk that our key management and key personnel becomes infected with COVID 19, and the measures adopted in response to the COVID 19 pandemic could make the integration of newly hired personnel more challenging.

In addition, as we continue to shift our operations towards a fully digital business model, we may be required to adapt the use of some or all of our properties. We may also decide to dispose of certain of our properties or may seek to terminate certain of our leases. Similarly, if and when business operations resume and return to pre-pandemic levels (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse _effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”), we may also seek changes to our overall composition of portfolio of_ properties, or the related use thereof. Moreover, the current use of our properties may not necessarily be appropriate or cost efficient for future operations. However, there can be no guarantee that it will be legally permissible to change the use of our properties at such time or that we will be able to dispose of properties on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Standardized terms and conditions have to comply with the statutory laws on general terms and conditions in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, which means that in many jurisdictions they are subject to intense scrutiny by the courts. The standard is even stricter if such terms and conditions are used vis-à-vis private consumers, such as in our WeBuyAnyCar business. If standardized documents, contracts, or terms and conditions we use contain provisions which are interpreted in a manner disadvantageous to us, or if any clauses are held to be invalid and thus replaced by statutory provisions which are disadvantageous to us, a large number of our contractual relationships could be affected. This could provide our counterparties with ----- unexpected legal rights and remedies (e.g., withdrawal rights), cause us to incur unexpected expenses and prevent us from operating our business as currently operated.

Our cash funding obligations are set in accordance with applicable pension legislation, assessed on a triennial basis and required to be agreed between us and independent trustees. Our cash funding obligations are further subject to increases in life expectancy. Our total contribution to these defined contribution schemes in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 was £6.4 million. We cannot guarantee that our future cash contributions will not undermine our capacity to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. In addition, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK are in deficit. As of March 28, 2021, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK had a deficit of £12.4 million (2020: £15.1 million). Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the plan assets underperform such yield, then this will create a deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisors, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. However, the plans hold only a portion of assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) and we cannot guarantee that the level of investment risk is reduced appropriately as the maturity approaches for each plan. Moreover, while we have contractual caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation, our pension liabilities in deferment are linked and subject to inflation. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that an increase in inflation will not lead to an increase in our pension deficit. Furthermore, plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans. While such risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields, any decrease in interest rates has the effect of decreasing bond yields, which in turn increases plan liabilities. Accordingly, the materialization of any of these risks, if significant, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the SEC. Certain of these amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. We have also included certain unaudited financial information prepared in accordance with IAS 17 (Leases), which is an accounting standard that was superseded by IFRS 16. Such unaudited financial information has important limitations; in particular, it is prepared in accordance with a historic accounting standard, IAS 17 (Leases), and has not been audited. As such, it is not comparable to the audited results due to adjustments and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Moreover, some of the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is adjusted for the estimated impact of COVID 19 and/or for certain run rate adjustments based on our most recent three months of trading. In particular, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA and ratios derived therefrom seek to adjust IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for the impact of COVID 19. The adjustments made to calculate IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances but are included for illustrative purposes only and have not been audited. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA is not comparable to the audited results and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for COVID-impacted periods with prior non-COVID impacted periods, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£2.0 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£43.9 million) with the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£44.5 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£66.2 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by adding back an amount of £11.3 million (based on management forecasts using operating results for March 2020 immediately prior to lockdowns, reflecting restrictions on operating activities due to COVID 19) and an amount of £2.7 million (representing provisions relating to bad debt and inventory). Such information and adjustments are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period.

Financial information for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 is based on management accounts and is included for illustrative purposes only, has not been reviewed or audited and may not be reflective of the actual results for such periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for the audited consolidated financial data of the Parent or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. We have also included 52-week IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA as of May 30, 2021. IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is calculated on the basis of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA for ----- the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and applying additional adjustments to give effect increases in profitability and volume in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, the our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying division, as well as the decrease in IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for our Automotive Services division, in the period from February 22, 2021 to May 30, 2021. IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is included for illustrative purposes only and, as a run rate calculation giving full year effect to the most recent three month period, is likely to differ from actual results for the period.

The unaudited aggregated financial information is derived by adding together the unaudited consolidated income statement information of BCA Marketplace for the 219-day period from and including April 1, 2019 to and including November 5, 2019 and the consolidated income statement information of the Parent for the 42-week period from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020 (which includes the 145-day post-CA Acquisition trading result from November 6, 2019 up to and including March 29, 2020). The financial information used in presenting such information includes information for the Parent from June 10, 2019 (the date of incorporation of the Parent), which overlaps with information of BCA Marketplace from April 1, 2019. However, the Parent was formed on June 10, 2019 for the purposes of facilitating the CA Acquisition, which was consummated on November 6, 2019 and the Parent did not trade prior to November 6, 2019. Moreover, while both the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, they relate to different entities that have not prepared their financial information on a consistent basis. Such unaudited aggregated financial information is included for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our income statement would have been if the CA Acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2019 and is not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period. The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None of the adjustments, estimates or run rate calculations have been audited by any independent auditors and should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment, estimate or calculation been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

As of March 28, 2021, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, our primary financing arrangements will be the Notes, the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility, and we would have had £1,760 million of Adjusted Total Debt (which excludes finance leases and borrowing under the Receivables Facility). See “Capitalization”and “Description of Other Financial Arrangements.”In addition, as of March 28, 2021, we had borrowings in an amount of £148.3 million under the Receivables Facility. The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions, including an economic downturn due to the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and amortization costs on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund the payment of principal of indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; ----- - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Borrowings under the Second Lien Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to SONIA, subject to a zero floor, plus an agreed margin. SONIA, EURIBOR and LIBOR could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these benchmark interest rates in the future, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, to the extent not fixed by means of hedging arrangements, would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to be published as panel bank rates after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all currencies will cease as panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, a floating rate equal to compounding overnight Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve in the United States plus a spread adjustment, by not later than the time that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate, although other alternative rates may also be used. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our debt linked to such a benchmark. Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used for the benchmark; or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to such benchmark and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The Issuer will be dependent upon payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement and cash flow from our operating companies to meet its obligations under the Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes principally through payments made pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreement, the provisions of intercompany loans, dividends and other distributions.

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our finance facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.,"Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due. We also experience seasonal fluctuations in our cash flow. Due to seasonal trends influencing both vehicle supply and demand, our revenue and operating results have varied, and likely will continue to vary, from quarter to quarter. For example, used vehicle sales in the UK tend to increase during vehicle registration plate change periods in March and September of each year. In March, in particular, new vehicle sales traditionally peak in the UK, and as a result, dealer vendors of the Vehicle Remarketing division typically experience an increase in part-exchange volumes, which has a subsequent effect of increasing ----- sales through the Marketplace. Conversely, our revenue typically decreases during the summer and in December, a seasonality pattern that is followed by sales in both the Vehicle Buying division and the Automotive Services division. Seasonality can therefore have a negative effect on our cash flow, thereby impacting our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, including the Notes, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, that revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID 19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities. See “—Risks Relating to Our Business—The _COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain” and “Operating and Financial Review—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_ If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Indenture and the terms governing the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, and any future debt, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In particular, upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, subject to any applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the relevant facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the relevant facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors accelerate payment of amounts under the relevant facilities, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. We are also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement. In particular, we are required to comply with a financial covenant to maintain our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio for each period of twelve months ending on any financial quarter date (the first such financial quarter ending April 3, 2022) if utilizations thereunder exceed a certain threshold.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Furthermore, the Additional Guarantors are only required to guarantee the Notes within two business days of the Issue Date.

Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. Perfection of the security interests in the Collateral, especially the Post-Closing Collateral, after the Issue Date increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests become avoided or subject to the liens of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens.

There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, or at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must be applied to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Indenture and the Notes as well as borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, if any, and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or improper corporate distribution on other grounds, or that a court would not otherwise set aside such Guarantee. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to decide that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which remains valid and enforceable. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and a right to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Senior Term Loan Facility and the Second Lien Facility. The exercise of the right of holders of the Notes to require the repurchase of the Notes upon a change of control could cause a default under our debt documents, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from entities of our group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the ----- Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain third-party financing to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Additionally, there are certain exceptions to the definition of “Change of Control”which allow changes in the ownership of the Issuer if certain conditions are satisfied, including if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such Change of Control on one occasion. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of _Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or_ redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the Parent’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole.

In addition, an investment in the Notes by U.S. investors may have significant tax consequences. See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.” -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the recourse that investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have against PwC based on its reports or the directors’ reports and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which PwC may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against PwC for damages arising out of an investment in or purchase of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

As a result, TDR Capital is able to control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of our directors, our corporate and management policies, potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of TDR Capital may differ from yours in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of TDR Capital, as ultimate majority shareholder, may be in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the Notes. TDR Capital has no contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business if we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indenture permits us to pay management fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and TDR Capital may have an interest in our doing so. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” Furthermore, TDR Capital and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly and indirectly with us, or with which we conduct business. TDR Capital and their affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. You should consider that the interests of these holders may differ from yours in material respects.

We have physical presence in 10 countries across the UK and continental Europe as well as unmatched sourcing, data, technology and logistics capabilities. As of March 28, 2021, our business comprises: - a leading B2B digital used vehicle marketplace across the UK and continental Europe, which facilitated the sale of approximately 1.5 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 1.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021; - a leading C2B digital used vehicle marketplace in the UK, WeBuyAnyCar, with sold volumes of 321,000 vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, reflecting the COVID 19 restrictions on the business that now has an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period); and - a leading automotive logistics service business in the UK, which moved more than 2.8 million vehicles in the UK in the fiscal year 2020 and 2.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021, and stored, refurbished and processed more than 950,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 675,000 in the fiscal year 2021. We estimate that for the fiscal year 2020 we came in contact with approximately one in every three vehicles in the UK (approximately 29 million touch points, of which approximately 13 million were unique vehicles out of a vehicle parc of approximately 41 million, and including approximately 24 million digital touch points). Through our digital used vehicle marketplaces (the “Marketplace”), we are a critical liquidity provider to the used vehicles market across the UK and continental Europe, matching the complex requirements of both vendors and buyers and also facilitating the purchase of individual vehicles from consumers. The Marketplace facilitates speedy disposal of high volumes of vehicles and offers a broad range of consistently graded vehicle stock, thereby providing efficiency, liquidity (i.e., fast disposal of vehicle stock) and choice. Moreover, we are the UK’s leading provider of automotive services solutions. By providing a full suite of auction and automotive services, we offer our customers solutions for almost all stages of the vehicle life-cycle, beginning as soon as the new car arrives at the port. Our scope of services provides synergistic benefits across our divisions, as our vehicle sales platforms, together with our automotive services solutions, generate vehicle and pricing data used in both our vehicle remarketing and vehicle buying operations. ----- Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, we have accelerated our digital transition and now transact digitally almost 100% of our volumes through online channels. We integrate our digital and physical assets to provide innovative multi-service solutions, maximizing speed, intelligence and performance across our comprehensive offerings. In the fiscal year 2021, 100% (2020: 37%) of our auction volumes in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division and 96% (2020: 84%) of our auction volumes in the International Vehicle Remarketing division were transacted online, which is a testament to our successful shift towards a predominantly digital online business model moving forward. In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, we generated £253.1 million of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to £232.8 million, £204.1 million and £174.4 million in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. We operate through three main business lines: (i) the B2B Marketplace business line, which is comprised of our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, (ii) the C2B Marketplace business line, which is WeBuyAnyCar, our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, and (iii) the Automotive Services business line, which is accounted for in our Automotive Services division. - B2B Marketplace: B2B Marketplace is our core business that facilitates the exchange of used vehicles between vendors and buyers through primarily digital auctions. As of March 28, 2021, our digital auctions are supported by 21 physical sites in the UK (23 as of June 1, 2021) and 30 physical sites in continental Europe at which vehicles are stored, inspected, repaired and refurbished. B2B Marketplace (which excludes WeBuyAnyCar) does not take title to the majority of vehicles that it sells, but instead serves as an agent between vendor and buyer and recognizes revenues through auction transaction fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical pre- and post- auction services such as inspections, appraisals, repairs, refurbishment, imaging, storage and handling. We also purchase vehicles directly from certain corporate vendors under outsourced remarketing contracts, whereby we directly buy our vendors’ inventory and have discretion over the remarketing channel through which we sell the vehicle. B2B Marketplace takes title to such vehicles until the time of resale and recognizes revenues for the full sale value of the vehicle less the cost of acquisition. Vehicles acquired pursuant to outsourced remarketing contracts are typically resold within 15 to 30 days of acquisition and in turn generate additional revenue above the auction fees. B2B Marketplace also includes our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, which is focused on purchasing batches of vehicles primarily from corporates in continental Europe. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division generated £90.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £116.3 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £109.4 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division sold approximately 867,000 vehicles (2020: 1,063,000 vehicles; 2019: 1,030,0000 vehicles). In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division generated £29.2 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £34.2 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £33.7 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division sold approximately 334,000 vehicles (2020: 401,000 vehicles; 2019: 388,000 vehicles). - C2B Marketplace: C2B Marketplace is our C2B vehicle buying business which operates in the UK through WeBuyAnyCar. WeBuyAnyCar purchases used vehicles directly from consumers, leveraging its proprietary online pricing quotation systems and efficient physical inspection processes to facilitate purchases from such consumers. WeBuyAnyCar has carried out a total of 2.2 million vehicle purchases since its inception in 2006, and in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar recorded more than 22 million unique visitors to its website and performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online. As of March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar operates in 357 locations across the UK, which are located within an average drive time of under 14 minutes to customers. In addition, WeBuyAnyCar offers swift services to its consumers, allowing them to obtain a quote in under 60 seconds and to then subsequently receive monies for the purchase of their vehicle within 30 minutes of the sale being concluded. C2B Marketplace remarkets the vehicles it purchases exclusively through B2B Marketplace within approximately 10 days and accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This allows us to actively manage the volumes and mix on the Marketplace, while helping to de-risk the supply of vehicles to the auction. ----- C2B Marketplace’s consistent and growing profitability over the past years demonstrates our ability to generate “metal margin” (accounted for in our Vehicle Buying division) on C2B vehicles in addition to core auction buyer fees (accounted for in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division). Vehicles sourced via our C2B Marketplace therefore result in higher profitability per vehicle for the CA Group. Our sophisticated and proprietary pricing mechanism and real-time market data enable us to more accurately price the purchase of vehicles to generate a profitable onward sale. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Vehicle Buying division generated £44.0 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £27.7 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £24.1 million), which was predominantly generated through C2B Marketplace (i.e., WeBuyAnyCar). - Automotive Services: Automotive Services provides vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. With our refurbishment offering (which has a 250,000 yearly vehicle refurbishment capacity), we are able to bring vehicles to either wholesale standard or a “Retail Ready” standard (which refers to vehicles that are cosmetically and mechanically prepared to be immediately placed for sale to end consumers and are therefore particularly attractive to online car dealers). These standards increase prices achieved at auction and render it simpler for dealers to on-sell the vehicle to consumers. We seek to develop a relationship with vendors and endeavor to act as a one-stop shop for vehicles throughout the majority of their lifecycle, expanding our revenue streams along the value chain and also positioning ourselves to be the preferred provider of remarketing services when the vehicles come off lease or roll out of the fleet. Our overall infrastructure and logistics network allow us to efficiently cover all key locations and major transport hubs in the UK. Automotive Services helps maximize the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies derived from the wide-ranging scope of services offered, benefitting both our customers as well as our own operations. Automotive Services generates revenue in the form of service fees. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, Automotive Services generated £12.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £22.6 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £19.1 million).",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1742,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW,1742.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,1742.2.1,COVID 19,"_General Impact_ Due to the unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers, leasing companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace were significantly reduced during the fiscal year 2021 with average weekly trading volume dipping to 4,000 at the start of the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021, compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020. The changes in operating environment spurred by the COVID 19 pandemic have accelerated our shift towards a fully digital online business model with increased focus on the functionality and usability of our digital platforms, as a result of which we were able to earn new contracts and increase our market share in spite of the challenging market conditions. The scale of the transformation is demonstrated by the fiscal year 2021 ending with 100% of UK auction sales having occurred online, compared to 37% in the fiscal year 2020. In addition to the enforced cessation of physical auctions in the UK, we faced restrictions such as site closures impacting the operation of the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate and recorded a reduction in the movement and inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. Our customers evolved their business models, for example by motor dealers operating a click-and-collect process during 2020 to be able to better deal with social distancing restrictions and, by August 2020, average weekly trading volumes recovered to 31,000. With the continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries, and the UK in particular, as well as governments lifting restrictions to public life, we expect the demand for our services increase. The shift towards a more digital operation model has, to an extent, mitigated the impact of COVID 19 and the lifting of COVID 19 restrictions is expected to increase demand in the long term as dealers look to restock their inventory. ----- _Impact on Results of Operations_ For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA were £190.1 million and £204.1 million, respectively, reflecting an estimated COVID 19 impact of £14.0 million in the fiscal year 2020. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA were £168.0 million and £232.8 million, respectively, reflecting an estimated COVID 19 impact of £64.8 million in the fiscal year 2021. For the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, we reported an operating profit of £100.2 million. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, we reported an operating loss of £224.5 million. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, we reported an operating profit of £47.4 million. We had cash and cash equivalents of £113.2 million and £247.2 million as of March 28, 2021 and March 29, 2020, respectively. _Measures Taken in Response to the COVID 19 Pandemic_ We have been and actively continue to monitor the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our operations, and our priority has been the safety of our employees and other stakeholders. As governments in the jurisdictions where we operate introduced restrictions at the outset of the COVID 19 pandemic, we quickly ceased physical auctions and introduced social distancing and other modifications to our ways of working to remain compliant. In response to the closure of our physical auction sites, we adopted swift measures to significantly reduce cash outflows by reducing our operating cost and implementing cash control measures, with the aim of maximizing our liquidity position. Specifically, we adopted the following measures, which were only necessary during the time of the first lockdown in the UK during March 2020 to July 2020 and were not implemented during the subsequent second and third lockdowns: - successfully negotiated with debtors and creditors on payment terms; - put on hold all non-essential and discretionary spend within the business, including any growth, expansionary or investment capital expenditures and increased controls around the cash disbursement process, including sign off by senior members of the finance team for any payments in excess of certain reduced thresholds; - negotiated tax deferrals with HMRC in respect of VAT and employment taxes; and - entered into arrangements with landlords to defer rent payments during the period of closure and took rates relief where available. We also made furlough arrangements for those staff unable to work in the UK where we furloughed as much as 80% of our staff at the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020 and, in parallel, applied for employee salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in continental Europe. Such schemes allow companies to place employees on paid leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s ordinary salary being partially reimbursed by the respective government. As of March 28, 2021, approximately 4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 furlough income across all jurisdictions totaled £35.5 million and rates relief totaled £8.3 million. As of March 28, 2021, remaining deferrals comprise VAT deferrals of £15.8 million, which are expected to be settled in full in instalments during the fiscal year 2022. As a result of the numerous cost-cutting and transitory measures taken at the beginning of the first lockdown in the UK, we came out of that lockdown with greater liquidity compared to our liquidity going into such lockdown. From the end of the first lockdown in the UK, we have managed to remain positive in terms of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA even in periods with government restrictions comparable with the first lockdown in the UK. Given the success of our digital offering with our clients and the level of profitability and efficiency achieved, we currently have no intention of reverting back to our previous predominantly physical auction model. _Impairment Review_ As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including £938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA Acquisition. While goodwill impairment is tested annually, the COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business constituted an impairment indicator that we assessed with respect to all intangible assets as well as goodwill. The impairment review is performed on a “value-inuse” basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth rate. Any impairment charge is then recognized in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount. As a result of our impairment review conducted as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, we recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment relating to the CA Acquisition in the amount of £266.4 million ----- in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge thereby specifically represented a change in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our _Business—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain.” We caution you that these impairment charges should not be regarded as_ an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding impairment charges for any future period. See “Forward-looking Statements.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1742,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW,1742.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,1742.2.2,Seasonality,"Due to seasonal trends influencing both vehicle supply and demand, our revenue and operating results have varied, and likely will continue to vary, from quarter to quarter. For example, used vehicle sales in the UK tend to increase during vehicle registration plate change periods in March and September of each year. In March, in particular, new vehicle sales traditionally peak in the UK, and as a result, dealer vendors of the Vehicle Remarketing division typically experience an increase in part-exchange volumes, which has a subsequent effect of increasing sales through the Marketplace. Conversely, our revenue typically decreases during the summer and in December, a seasonality pattern that is followed by sales in both the Vehicle Buying division and the Automotive Services division. As a result of these fluctuations, our revenue tends to be lowest in the quarter ending in December and highest in the quarter ending March. In addition, there is a reduced level of activity during the Christmas and New Year holiday period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

However, we conduct operations in the UK and continental Europe, as a result of which approximately 11% of our revenue in the fiscal year 2021 was denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, with the significant majority of this denominated in euro. We also conduct a limited number of transactions in a small number of other currencies. Exchange rates between the pound sterling and the euro have ranged from €1.1605 per pound sterling on March 31, 2019 to €1.1176 per pound sterling on March 29, 2020 and €1.1691 per pound sterling on March 28, 2021. Typically, our costs in a currency other than the pound sterling are matched by corresponding revenue in that same currency. Our results of operations may nevertheless be affected by the translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on converting the results of these operations reported in currencies other than the pound sterling to sterling for group consolidation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

In addition, our revenue and profits are largely dependent on the supply of vehicles to the Vehicle Remarketing and Vehicle Buying divisions, the demand for vehicles sold by the Vehicle Remarketing divisions and the availability of vehicles which require services provided by the Automotive Services division.

As such, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements are not comparable to the other Consolidated Financial Statements since they only cover the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, representing the period from the incorporation date of the Parent on June 10, 2019. In addition, due to the CA Acquisition, which completed on November 6, 2019, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect our trading results during the period from April 1, 2019 to November 5, 2019. Below is an overview of the trading history covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements. - The Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of BCA Marketplace and its subsidiaries from and including April 2, 2018 to and including March 31, 2019. Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 52 weeks of trading, reflecting our results of operations prior to the CA Acquisition. ----- - The Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent and Constellation Automotive (which were incorporated for the purpose of facilitating the CA Acquisition and, as such, are holding companies with no operations and no assets other than the shares held) from and including the date of incorporation of the Parent on June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020. During the period from June 10, 2019 to the completion date of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019, the Parent had no activities and had very limited financial results to report. Following the consummation of the CA Acquisition on November 6, 2019, our financial results are consolidated at the Parent level. Accordingly, the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements represent 145 days of trading, reflecting our results of operations after the CA Acquisition. - The Fiscal Year 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations of the Parent group from and including March 30, 2020 to and including March 28, 2021.

Accordingly, we have applied IFRS 16 since the fiscal year 2020. We have adopted IFRS 16 under the modified retrospective approach on April 1, 2019, with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 recognized on adoption as an adjustment to opening equity. Under this approach, comparative information for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 is not restated and, as a result, no IFRS 16 adjustments have been made to the Fiscal Year 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements and the Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information, may not be comparable insofar as they relate to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases). Following the CA Acquisition, a purchase price allocation exercise was undertaken in order to identify the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired thereunder, in line with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations). IFRS 3 requires the revaluation of IFRS 16 right of use assets and lease liabilities using a revised incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”). The IBR we used for these purposes increased significantly following the CA Acquisition as a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection therewith. Due to the significant change in IBR used for the valuation of right of use assets and lease liabilities resulting from the CA Acquisition, the full year IFRS 16 depreciation and interest included in our Fiscal Year 2020 Aggregated Financial Information represents the aggregation of (i) the pre-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and interest calculated with reference to the original, pre-CA Acquisition IBR and (ii) the post-CA Acquisition IFRS 16 depreciation and interest calculated with reference to the revised, post-CA Acquisition IBR.

Revenue in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £762.9 million, from £546.0 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £1,308.9 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Revenue in the International Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £111.3 million, from £78.8 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £190.1 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Revenue in the Vehicle Buying division (excluding interdivision revenue) increased by £982.9 million, from £682.4 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £1,665.3 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Revenue in the Automotive Services division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £135.2 million, or 88.2%, from £153.3 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £288.5 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Each of these increases was primarily due to the longer trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition. In addition, while revenue was heavily ----- impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic with various levels of regional and national restrictions in the UK and our continental European locations, we have only seen a marginal impact on revenue from the COVID 19 pandemic during the fiscal year 2020. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by £1,747.1 million, from £1,260.7 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £3,007.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the longer trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition. _Operating Costs_ Operating costs decreased by £94.3 million, or 19.1%, from £493.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £398.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a significant goodwill impairment in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, offset by the longer trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by £22.6 million, from £0.4 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £23.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily due to foreign exchange profit primarily recognized on retranslation of euro-denominated indebtedness. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs increased by £44.5 million, or 75.6%, from £58.9 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £103.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the longer trading period in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition and the post-CA Acquisition financing structure. _Share of Loss of Equity-accounted Investments_ Share of loss of equity-accounted investments increased by £1.2 million, from £0.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £1.3 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the underlying trading performance of the relevant investments. _Income Tax Charge_ Income tax charge decreased by £30.3 million, from a tax charge of £16.7 million and an effective tax rate of (4.7%) for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to a tax credit of £13.6 million and an effective tax rate of 39.6% for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. The changes are primarily due to the underlying profit before tax in the respective periods. In addition: - Fiscal Year 2020: The £16.7 million tax charge, on a loss before tax of £351.8 million, arose predominantly as a result of: (i) the net non-deductible impairment of goodwill of £50.6 million; (ii) net non-deductible costs associated with the CA Acquisition of £10.0 million; (iii) an increase in the UK tax rate on our deferred tax assets of £17.6 million; and (iv) a net non-deductible foreign exchange movement of £4.6 million, which collectively increased the tax charge for the period when compared to the profit before tax at the UK statutory tax rate. Excluding the effect of these items would give an effective tax rate of 21.4% for the period. - Fiscal Year 2021: The £13.6 million tax credit, on a loss before tax of £34.3 million, arose predominantly as a result of: (i) a net non-taxable foreign exchange movement of £4.0 million and £3.8 million from the payment for group relief for less than 19.0% which increased the tax credit for the period. Excluding the effect of these items would give an effective tax rate of 13.4% for the period. _Reported Adjusted EBITDA_ Reported Adjusted EBITDA increased by £125.7 million from £89.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £214.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily ----- as a result of the shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days) compared to the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a result of the CA Acquisition. _IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA_ IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA increased by £145.6 million from £87.2 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020, 2019 to £232.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This increase was primarily as a result of the shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days) compared to the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a result of the CA Acquisition and underlying business growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Each of these decreases was primarily due to the shorter trading period in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales decreased by £1,293.4 million, or 50.6%, from £2,554.1 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £1,260.7 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the shorter trading period in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition. _Operating Costs_ Operating costs increased by £119.4 million, or 32.0%, from £373.7 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £493.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the shorter trading period in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 as described above as a result of the CA Acquisition and a significant goodwill impairment in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 relating to the COVID 19 pandemic. _Finance Income_ Finance income decreased by £0.1 million, or 20.0%, from £0.5 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £0.4 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs increased by £47.7 million from £11.2 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £58.9 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the post-CA Acquisition financing structure and the recognition of IFRS 16 interest costs. _Share of Loss of Equity-accounted Investments_ Share of loss of equity-accounted investments was £0.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. No share of loss of equity-accounted investments was recorded in the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019. _Income Tax Charge_ Income tax charge decreased by £4.2 million, from a tax charge of £20.9 million and an effective tax rate of 23.4% for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to a tax charge of £16.7 million and an effective tax rate of (4.7%) for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The changes are primarily due to the underlying profit before tax in the respective periods. In addition: - Fiscal Year 2020: The £16.7 million tax charge, on a loss before tax of £351.8 million, arose predominantly as a result of: (i) the net non-deductible impairment of goodwill of £50.6 million; (ii) net non-deductible costs associated with the CA Acquisition of £10.0 million; (iii) an increase in the UK tax rate on our deferred tax assets of £17.6 million; and (iv) a net non-deductible foreign exchange movement of £4.6 million, which collectively increased the tax charge for the period when compared to the profit before ----- tax at the UK statutory tax rate. Excluding the effect of these items would give an effective tax rate of 21.4% for the period. - Fiscal Year 2019: Our parent entity was a listed company and the financing structure and costs relating to significant or non-recurring items was substantially different to the period post the CA Acquisition. The effective tax rate of 23.4% therefore reflects these structural differences and the differences in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. _Reported Adjusted EBITDA_ Reported Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £82.8 million, or 48.2%, from £171.9 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £89.1 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. This decrease was primarily as a result of the shorter trading period captured in the results for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020 (i.e., 145 days) compared to the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 (i.e., 52 weeks) as a result of the CA Acquisition. _IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA_ IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £87.2 million, or 50.0%, from £174.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £87.2 million for the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020.

IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £22.1 million from £190.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £168.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA increased by £28.7 million from £204.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 to £232.8 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. We commenced the fiscal year 2021 with all markets operating under varying national government restrictions in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Swift actions were taken to reduce costs and preserve cash, including furloughing a significant number of employees and utilizing government initiatives to support employment costs for employees who were not able to contribute to the ongoing operation of the business. Management also negotiated with landlords to reduce or defer rental payments and temporarily ceased all consumer vehicle buying activity. Physical auctions and the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate closed with a resulting reduction in the movement and inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. During April 2021, all auctions took place on our online platforms initially populated with vehicles that had been imaged and graded before lockdown. At commencement of the restrictions, demand was greatest for vehicles at lower price points. Over 90% of the transporter fleet was taken off the road, with the remaining vehicle moves taking place to support key workers and provide services to organizations which were not able to cease operations, including for example the transportation of ambulances for the NHS. Vehicles continued to arrive into the UK by ship, and these vehicles were received and stored in line with working regulations. Trading was similarly impacted across continental Europe with differing lockdown restrictions impacting sales and cross-border movements. The magnitude of the COVID 19 impact on economic activity practically mitigated any post-Brexit trading impact on the business. As European countries began to ease restrictions and the UK government announced that car dealerships could reopen from June 1, 2020, we saw demand increase across our online platforms and were able to recommission our transport capabilities to support the vehicle logistics of vendors and buyers. Trading rebounded in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2021 as restrictions were lifted and the workforce largely returned from furlough. Strong stable pricing provided good operational efficiencies with predictable results for buyers and sellers. Refreshed versions of BCA Live Online and the BCA Buyer mobile application provide enhanced insight every time a buyer looks at, bids on or buys a vehicle. We were well placed to capitalize on pent-up demand with all UK auctions fully digital, utilizing BCA Live Online and the BCA Buyer mobile application. At the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year 2021, we launched the “Retail Ready” digital sales channel exclusively for trade customers to meet demand for high quality vehicles and to shorten inventory holding times. The channel offers vehicles prepared cosmetically and mechanically to a new industry retail standard allowing dealers to immediately place these vehicles onto their forecourt with little or no preparation and cost. ----- The momentum continued into the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021 despite ongoing restrictions across continental Europe and the introduction of tiered restrictions in the UK. Customers continued to develop their online as well as click and collect capabilities in order to continue trading at scale in this environment. It was not until the return of a stricter lockdown in the UK that spanned the whole of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021 that activity was again significantly suppressed. The impact on trading was far less than in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021, reflecting the adaptability and resilience of the used car sector and the incremental developments to our digital capability. The end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020 provided limited disruption in comparison to the impact of COVID 19 restrictions. _Divisional Review_ UK Vehicle Remarketing The division generated revenue of £1,308.9 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £90.5 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £1,377.1 million and £116.3 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. The division’s volumes, revenues and Reported Adjusted EBITDA were adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic restrictions during the fiscal year 2021. Our revenues are impacted by the mix of vehicles for which we take title, whereby the full auction price of vehicles sold is recognized as revenue, and those where we serve as an agent between vendor and buyer, for which revenues are recognized in relation to auction fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical pre- and post- auction services. To enable vendors and buyers to continue to trade with confidence, UK Vehicle Remarketing accelerated its digital transformation, trading fully online during the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 (2020: 37%). After the temporary cessation of physical auctions at the end of the fiscal year 2020, the division commenced first quarter trading using its existing online auction platforms, including BCA Buyer mobile application, BCA Live Online and BCA Buy Now with vehicles that had been imaged and prepared prior to the implementation of pandemic restrictions. Working practices were revised through April 2020 and May 2020, so vendor vehicles could be received and processed in line with working regulations. When automotive dealerships were allowed to reopen on June 1, 2020, the division saw strong demand and stable pricing which continued into the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021, with record sales volumes in September 2020 of over 25,000 units per week for four consecutive weeks. September 2020 saw the introduction of our “Retail Ready”sales channel. Utilizing our expertise in wholesale vehicle storage and refurbishment has enabled the division to introduce and define “Retail Ready” as a new vehicle condition standard. This digital channel hosts vehicles prepared cosmetically and mechanically, covering the repair of bodywork dents, stone chips, paint repairs, wheels, glass and lights, interior upholstery, and tire condition and compatibility checks. Once refurbished, the vehicles are fully retail valeted and come with a valid service for at least three months or 2,000 miles, a valid Ministry of Transport (MOT) certificate for at least 6 months and all auxiliary items such as Satellite Navigation SD cards and charging cables present. This enables customers to immediately place these vehicles onto their forecourt with no preparation time and cost required. The business has undergone significant changes to sales day operations, and during the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021, the UK Vehicle Remarketing division reorganized the workforce, resulting in redundancies of certain branch based roles. The tiered restrictions in the UK during November 2020 and December 2020, and the full lockdown across the UK in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021 did not impact the business as severely as the initial lockdown as our customers had evolved their ability to operate with social distancing and other restrictions in place. Outsourced remarketing contract volumes have been impacted, reflecting reduced lease churn and de-fleet activity throughout the fiscal year 2021. BCA Partner Finance continues to support buyer demand in our marketplace with penetration at 10.6% of UK Vehicle Remarketing sales funded by BCA Partner Finance (2020: 12.7%). The reduction in penetration has been due to dealers taking a more conservative position on their volumes and also the level of government support that has been available throughout the fiscal year 2021. International Vehicle Remarketing The division generated revenue of £190.1 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £29.2 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £201.0 million and £34.2 million for the unaudited ----- aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. Availability of volumes was suppressed across Europe as leasing companies and OEMs experienced delays in the return of financed vehicles and there was reduced availability of new vehicles following COVID 19 disruptions. This was partially offset by some additional international cross border buying activity undertaken in response to the various levels of supply and demand seen across different markets, supported by our transport network of accredited partners. Average profitability per vehicle increased driven by changes in country mix, in part reflecting the differing impacts of COVID 19 restrictions and increased export fee penetration. In June 2020, the International Vehicle Remarketing division commissioned its first automated inspection units in continental Europe, and at the end of the fiscal year 2021 were operating a number of automated units in Denmark, France and the Netherlands. These drive-through units assess vehicle condition, reducing the need for manual inspection and ensuring a consistent and accurate assessment. The division also established a new vehicle reconditioning center in France in partnership with Emil Frey, which began operation in August 2020. This facility offers refurbishment and grade enhancement to our vendors, maximizing sales performance at auction. Towards the end of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021, the division experienced renewed restrictions in some of the markets in which it operates across Europe as national governments address increased COVID19 infection levels. Vehicle Buying The division generated revenue of £1,665.3 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £44.0 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £1,529.8 million and £27.7 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. WeBuyAnyCar continues to maintain its place as a market leading C2B business in the UK online direct car buying market. Revenue and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA increased period-on-period driven by higher revenue per units sold partially offset by lower annual volume sold. Despite the significant disruption to the division’s retail estate during the fiscal year 2021, with long periods of enforced closure, the buying network continued to expand in order to provide convenience for consumers ending the year with 357 sites (2020: 315). Vehicles are sold from sites across the UK Vehicle Remarketing estate and now include three WeBuyAnyCar dedicated selling centers. The division supplies a controlled and diverse range of vehicles across all makes and marques, to support the UK Vehicle Remarketing division auction sales program. During the fiscal year 2021, WeBuyAnyCar delivered a new record volume week and purchased its 2 millionth vehicle 15 years after commencing trading and only four years after achieving the 1 millionth vehicle milestone. This accelerated volume is underpinned by the continued growth in brand recognition and consumer trust from the public. Our Christmas Day TV advertising campaign was met with strong consumer interest, with record festive period website visits. As the brand builds the division is expanding the marketing and advertising channels across digital platforms (Facebook, YouTube, etc.) to broaden engagement with a wider audience. The move to 100% online auctions in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, and the development of three dedicated selling hubs means we are better able to track and analyze customer demand and ensure we are servicing it appropriately. Inventory at March 28, 2021 was £107.0 million (March 29, 2020: £44.2 million), reflecting the continued growth in the business compared with a period of inventory reduction in the prior year as COVID 19 restrictions came into place. Within continental Europe, Vehicle Buying has increased 17.4% on prior year as we have improved our market intelligence enabling us to better identify vehicle demand. We continue to focus on opportunities to raise awareness of auction, purchasing batches of vehicles that enrich the remarketing programs for both vendors and buyers. Automotive Services The division generated revenue of £288.5 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £12.5 million for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 compared to £396.6 million and £22.6 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. During the fiscal year 2021, the division was adversely impacted by the COVID 19 restrictions in the UK, with the majority of vehicle movements restricted, most of the fleet off the road and employees furloughed. The division did maintain some activity during COVID 19 restrictions, especially supporting key workers and the emergency services, including through the movement of ambulances for the NHS. ----- Government initiatives were used to support employment costs, and rent deferrals were negotiated with landlords and finance companies. Activity began to recommence in June 2020, following the easing of restrictions and reopening of car dealerships, with all business areas returning to profitability and delivering higher margin work that could not be performed earlier in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021. The division continued to increase the penetration of internal moves and refurbishments for UK Vehicle Remarketing, utilizing an increased transporter fleet following the strategic acquisition of used transporters from some smaller distressed operators, driving increased internal efficiency and reduced costs. Logistics continued to see strong demand from leasing companies for inspections and collections following easing of lockdown restrictions, and vehicle flow efficiency returned to our Fleet Solutions and Vehicle Services sites as dispatches to customers returned to normal levels post-lockdown. During the fiscal year 2021, Fleet Solutions utilized the capability and expertise developed in preparing and refurbishing fleet vehicles to establish and support the newly developed “Retail Ready” industry vehicle standard. In order to support “Retail Ready,”we announced the development of the new 65-acre mega-center in Bristol. Leveraging our strong and well established integrated capability has enabled the division to accelerate the delivery of “Retail Ready” vehicles to support the new sales channel.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA increased by £15.7 million from £174.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £190.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA increased by £29.7 million from £174.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019 to £204.1 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. The period-on-period growth in revenue, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA has been driven by increased sales of vehicles by the Vehicle Buying division and strong performance in outsourced remarketing contracts (where we typically account for the full vehicle value within revenue), which continued to deliver growth in vehicle sold volumes. Increased sales, control over variable operating costs and overhead efficiency from greater volume throughput contributed to IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA growth. This strong trading performance has been delivered despite the disruption to trading during the latter half of March 2020 and after taking into account additional provisions against vehicle values as a result of COVID 19. During March 2020, national governments across Europe responded to the COVID 19 pandemic and implemented restrictions including social distancing lockdown arrangements, resulting in a cessation of physical auctions, the closure of the WeBuyAnyCar retail estate and a significant reduction in the movement and inspection of vehicles within Automotive Services. This had a significant impact on financial performance during March 2020, as a large element of our operating costs relate to payroll, property and transporter leases. Given the speed at which restrictions were imposed, it was not possible to reduce costs at the same rate as the reduction in operating activity. We furloughed over 80% of employees, and utilized government initiatives across Europe to support employment costs, retail premises rents and business rates. Management negotiated with landlords to reduce or defer rental payments, to maximize liquidity throughout the restrictions. At the end of the fiscal year 2020, management recognized an exceptional COVID 19 related goodwill impairment. This reflected the impact of the time value of money on earnings and growth, following the suppression of our operational activities as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. _Divisional Review_ UK Vehicle Remarketing The division generated revenue of £1,377.1 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £116.3 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £1,242.5 million and £109.4 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The division traded strongly during the fiscal year 2020 despite the impact of the temporary cessation of physical auctions in March 2020 as a result of government restrictions in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Revenue increased as a result of increased volumes including an extended sales program during the Christmas period. Auction activity throughout the fiscal year 2020 was driven by strong volumes from the Vehicle Buying division (WeBuyAnyCar) and outsourced remarketing contracts. This was supported by BCA Partner Finance penetration, which continues to increase. The BCA Partner Finance proposition, which includes branded auctions, part-exchange financing ----- and funding 100% of the hammer price plus fees and transport of purchases, continues to support dealer customers through the liquidity it provides. International Vehicle Remarketing The division generated revenue of £201.0 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £34.2 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £184.3 million and £33.7 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The division performed strongly in the period with continued growth in remarketing volumes. Revenue for the fiscal year 2020 was driven by increased fees and including a higher proportion of cross border sales. Strong performance in Denmark and the Netherlands along with volume growth in Germany and France, contributed to an increase in revenue, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA and IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA. Our Danish auction successfully transitioned to a fully online auction program in fiscal year 2020. BCA Norway, which commenced trading in April 2019, generated good volumes focusing on remarketing of electric vehicles, due to the high penetration of electric vehicles in this region. Demand for cross-border sourcing of vehicles in Europe continued to rise period-on-period and is supported by our transport network of accredited partners. From the second week of March 2020, national restrictions for COVID 19 were implemented across Europe, starting with Italy and France, which were amongst the first to implement full lockdown. While all European countries were impacted, those with lighter social distancing measures, for example Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and Germany, allowed trading at greater scale through March 2020. Vehicle Buying The division generated revenue of £1,529.8 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £27.7 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £1,219.8 million and £24.1 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. WeBuyAnyCar maintained double-digit volume growth with an expanded network of 315 sites providing increased convenience for consumers. During the fiscal year 2020, a record 10,200 vehicles were purchased in a single week by WeBuyAnyCar. The division supplied a controlled and diverse range of vehicles across all makes and marques, to support the UK Vehicle Remarketing division auction sales program. Inventory as of March 29, 2020 was £44.2 million (March 31, 2019: £29.3 million), reflecting the continued growth in the business, offset by the impact of COVID 19 restrictions. In line with government guidelines WeBuyAnyCar closed its retail estate from March 23, 2020, preventing the purchase of vehicles from consumers. The online channels of the UK Vehicle Remarketing division have continued to sell vehicles that were already held by WeBuyAnyCar. At the period end management made additional provisions against inventory given the price uncertainty as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic and associated restrictions. European car buying operations were paused as the impact of COVID 19 became evident, resulting in an operating loss due to costs associated with holding vehicles, and the impact of vehicles sold below purchase price due to temporarily reduced demand. Automotive Services The division generated revenue of £396.6 million and IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £22.6 million for the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 compared to £381.4 million and £19.1 million for the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The division continued to increase the penetration of internal moves and refurbishment completed for UK Vehicle Remarketing and WeBuyAnyCar, driving increased internal efficiency and reducing costs. In the period since the CA Acquisition, the services business performed well with increased demand for manufacturer accredited refurbishment capability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Revenue in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £155.8 million, or 23.1%, from £675.3 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £831.1 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to growth in outsourced remarketing contracts and increased supply of vehicles, particularly from the Vehicle Buying division. Revenue in the International Vehicle Remarketing division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £21.0 million, or 20.8%, from £101.2 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £122.2 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased sold volumes and an increase in transport and export services. Revenue in the Vehicle Buying division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £159.0 million, or 23.1%, from £688.4 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £847.4 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased volume of vehicles purchased and the continuing refinement of the valuation process. Revenue in the Automotive Services division (excluding inter-division revenue) increased by £31.9 million, or 15.1%, from £211.4 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £243.3 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the supply of vehicles returning to expected levels, increased opportunities for higher value refurbishment services and the continuing efficiencies resulting from providing integrated services to the wider CA Group. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by £336.1 million, or 24.0%, from £1,402.8 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £1,738.9 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in activity, as seen in revenue, over the same period. _Operating Costs_ Operating costs increased by £21.7 million, or 10.1%, from £214.7 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £236.4 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by £0.8 million from £0.3 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £1.1 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs increased by £11.3 million from £5.8 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £17.1 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the recognition of IFRS 16 interest costs. ----- _Income Tax Charge_ Income tax charge decreased by £1.8 million, or 14.3%, from a tax charge of £12.6 million and an effective tax rate of 22.7% for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to a tax charge of £10.8 million and an effective tax rate of 20.5% for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019. The changes are primarily due to a net tax credit in relation to significant or non-recurring items including in relation to amortization of acquired intangible assets. Despite a lower effective tax rate for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019, the income tax charge increased primarily as a result of an increased profitability. _Reported Adjusted EBITDA_ Reported Adjusted EBITDA increased by £37.1 million, or 37.2%, from £99.6 million for the 210-day period ended October 28, 2018 to £136.7 million for the 219-day period ended November 5, 2019.

A variety of factors influence our financial condition and liquidity, including: - a reduction in cash flows from operating activities due to, for instance, volume fluctuations in our business and pricing pressures we face from our competitors; - adverse working capital developments, including increases in non-collectible receivables (to the extent we do not receive recourse through a vehicle held a security) and changes in supplier payment terms; ----- - our inability to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and - higher capital expenditures and funding requirements. If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay business activities, fixed costs and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. As of March 28, 2021, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, our primary financing arrangements will be the Notes, the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility, and we would have had £113 million of Adjusted Cash. See “Capitalization.” Although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs for the foreseeable future, no assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. No assurance can be given that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes and the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Second Lien Facility, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.1,UK and Continental European Vehicle Parc,"We operate in the UK and continental Europe used vehicle market. The number of vehicles in operation (the “vehicle parc”) across the UK and continental Europe has grown consistently since 2012, driven by a relatively stable vehicle parc churn and growing vehicle penetration rates. Vehicle penetration rates, defined as number of vehicles in circulation per capita in a country, are expected to continue to grow for most markets. The European light vehicle parc grew at a CAGR of approximately 1.7% between 2012 and 2019, and currently stands at approximately 320 million units (for the year 2020). According to IHS, the European light vehicle parc is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 0.8% between 2021 and 2026, driven by growth in the penetration of vehicles per population, with new additions to the vehicle parc in particular of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Since the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, the importance of vehicle ownership for consumers has been strengthened (see “—Key Trends”.) The below chart shows the evolution of the European light vehicle parc between 2012 and 2020, and projections between 2021 and 2026: _Source: IHS database[(1)]._ (1) “Other Europe” represents Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Romania, Ireland, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia and Estonia. Sales of new cars eventually translate into used car transactions through used car churn. Used car churn, which is used as a measure of annual turnover in the ownership of cars in operation, varies by geography. In the UK market, for the fiscal year 2019, used car churn stood at approximately 23%, compared to approximately 13% in the continental European market, in line with customary trends. As a result, used car transaction volumes as a proportion of the total vehicle parc are higher in the UK than in continental Europe. We believe that the growing popularity of PCP (Personal Contract Purchase) plans among new car sales has contributed to an increased visibility and rates of churn in the UK. An increasing amount of cars coming off PCP plans offers a stream of supply for the used car market, many of which are transacted via exchanges such as Constellation’s B2B Marketplace. In addition, used car churn across the UK and continental Europe is impacted by a number of key factors. These include: - Maturing leases and other finance agreements; - Changing consumer preferences; ----- - Necessary cost of repairs as vehicles age, as well as warranty expirations; - Tax and regulatory changes such as low emission restrictions and fees related thereto; - Dealer and OEM finance offers and promotions; - Rental and car sharing fleets, which typically churn vehicles at a faster rate than vehicles in private ownership, according to IHS; - Insurance cost, safety, recalls, reliability and technological improvements Used vehicle churn is a key factor of our business model. Given the graduated auction fee structure is relatively insensitive to vehicle price, the business model is more dependent on the volume of vehicles going through the marketplace than the overall value of the vehicles.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.2,UK and Continental European Used Car Market,"The continental European used car market was estimated by Roland Berger to be valued at €410 billion for the year 2020. The total volume of used car sales in Europe amounted to approximately 45 million cars during the same period, of which approximately 84% were derived from continental Europe and the remainder from the UK, according to IHS. Moreover, annual sale volume movements in the used car market have been proportionally lower than in the new car market, as the used car market is far less sensitive to economic downturns than the new car market, due in part to the greater size of the used car market and the fact that certain periods of economic stress can be a driver of used car transactions, such as de-fleeting of underutilized car rental fleets or consumers trading down cars. For example, new car sales in the UK were more volatile between 2008 and 2020 than used car sales, with a peak-to-trough maximum variance of approximately 39% compared to approximately 13% for used car sales during the same period. _Source: IHS._",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.3,Impact of the COVID 19 Pandemic on the Used Car Market,"From the end of the first quarter of 2020, the UK and continental European used car markets were impacted by the temporary closure of bricks and mortar dealerships as a result of lockdown measures and forced temporary business closures resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic. Following the introduction of these lockdown measures, the used car markets in the UK, France, Germany and Italy recorded a significant decline through March and April 2020. However, volumes began to recover strongly from early June 2020, as lockdown restrictions gradually started to ease in these regions. The German market suffered from another sharp downturn as a result of the renewed lockdown imposed in December 2020, but the latest data from Indicata indicates that volumes have recovered close to pre-COVID levels. In France, despite a recovery from a trough in April 2020, French used car sale volumes have remained below pre-COVID 19 levels. The latest trading data from Indicata indicates that used car volumes in Italy and the Netherlands have recovered to pre-COVID levels. In our largest market, the UK, used car sales suffered a year-on-year decline of approximately 11% in the fiscal year 2020, to approximately 7.4 million in 2020 from approximately 8.3 million in 2019, according to IHS, driven by mandatory retail closures during periods of lockdown. Despite the ongoing global pandemic, the UK recorded periods of strong recovery when such restrictions were subsequently lifted and retailers ----- reopened, driving monthly used car transaction volumes from July to October 2020 above those for the same period in 2019 and demonstrating the continued strong demand for used cars by end consumers. The continued strength of demand for used cars throughout this period is also evidenced by the fact that average transaction prices remained above pre-pandemic levels from July to October 2020, during which retailers were open. The impact on the used car market of the varying forms of lockdown from November 2020 to April 2021 was less severe than the initial lockdown from March 2020 to June 2020, primarily due to the increased use by dealers of click-and-collect channels, which they were able to develop and improve during the periods of mandatory closures from March 2020. Following the easing of COVID 19-related restrictions and the reopening of retailers on April 12, 2021 in the UK, used car transactions have bounced back strongly, as evidenced by the chart below: _Source: Indicata Market Watch (Edition 16, May 2021), SMMT._ The used car market, especially in the UK, is expected to remain strong in the near-term, supported by renewed appetite for individual vehicle ownership (Source: Roland Berger). Moreover, an increased amount of household savings accumulated through the COVID 19 pandemic bolsters the consumption outlook (Source: _HSBC)._ Vehicle parc growth rates in key markets across Europe are expected to grow at CAGR ranging from 0.5% to 1.8% between 2021 and 2026 (Source: IHS).",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Used Vehicle Market Ecosystem,18.2.1,,"Our UK Vehicle Remarketing and International Vehicle Remarketing divisions, which trade under the BCA brand name, as well as WeBuyAnyCar, our C2B Marketplace business line which represents our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, constitute significant parts of the value chain within which we are active, as illustrated by the below chart: _Source: Management Information._ Market participants include: - Vendors, who are looking to dispose of vehicles, and are divided into the below groups: - Corporate fleet, including finance and leasing companies (looking to dispose over-age or overmileage vehicles, repossessed vehicles, off-lease vehicles, including vehicles after PCP plans); ----- - Dealers and car supermarkets (looking to move unwanted part-exchange stock or liquidate aged inventory); - OEMs (looking to dispose vehicles after corporate fleet or other ownership); and - C2B marketplaces or vehicle buying platforms (consumer-facing companies that seek to liquidate stock purchased directly from consumers). - Marketplaces and exchanges, which comprise of firms looking to enable vendors to sell used vehicles to a variety of buyers, as well as to provide a logistics solution from sellers to buyers; - Classifieds, which comprise of online automotive classified websites that generate leads for traditional dealers, car supermarkets and consumers looking to dispose of used vehicles, and provide purely advertising and lead-generation services without end-to-end transaction capabilities; - Trade Buyers, who comprise of mainly professional players, including traditional dealers, car supermarkets and online B2C players; and - Consumers, who comprise of private individuals looking to buy or dispose of vehicles, and who may also trade vehicles amongst themselves (C2C transactions), in addition to the other channels described above. Marketplaces and exchanges are at the center of the used car value chain, offering transparency, speed, certainty and liquidity for both vendors and buyers. They form a key part of the fleet management infrastructure for vendors by outsourcing non-core competencies and helping to extract maximum value quickly, as well as representing a significant channel for buyers, driven by their ability to offer on-market pricing and maximum choice of vehicles on used vehicle marketplaces. A significant fragmentation of buyers and vendors across the UK and continental European markets enhances the prominence of used car marketplaces as a critical channel for transactions. By way of illustration, the largest used car dealership in the UK has a market share of approximately 3%, while the largest European used car dealership has a market share inferior to 1%. Leading marketplaces could be seen to benefit from self-reinforcing dynamics whereby as they grow in both scale and geographic breadth, their attractiveness to both buyers and vendors increases, which in turn reinforces their leadership position. By adding ancillary services such as logistics, vehicle refurbishment and buyer financing, among others, an automotive marketplace can also strengthen the attractiveness of its services to its customers and thereby increase customer stickiness, while also growing the level of profit achieved per vehicle transacted through its platform. A key success factor for a leading automotive marketplace is also having a reliable and diverse source of vehicles flowing through its platform. Our Marketplace is a key participant in the used car market value chain throughout both the UK and continental Europe. Notably, in the UK, we came into contact with approximately 13 million unique vehicles in the fiscal year 2020, representing approximately one in three of all registered cars in the UK. WeBuyAnyCar, our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, is a leading online C2B used vehicle buying company, with more than 2.2 million cars bought since its inception and 461,000 vehicles purchased and sold annually, on an annualized run-rated basis based on March, April and May 2021. WeBuyAnyCar provides UK Vehicle Remarketing with used vehicles that would otherwise go to C2C markets or partexchanges. Once acquired on the WeBuyAnyCar platform, the purchased vehicles are sold through the auctions conducted by UK Vehicle Remarketing, with an acquisition to sale cycle of approximately 10 days, on average (fiscal year 2020, which is representative of our ordinary course business operations in a steady state). WeBuyAnyCar provided approximately 35% of the UK Vehicle Remarketing sale volumes in the fiscal year 2021. Our integrated suite of services, both transactional (such as auctioning and vehicle buying) and transactionenabling (such as refurbishment, transport, valuation and other services) places us at the center of the automotive value chain.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Key Trends,18.3.1,Increased consumer perception of the importance of car ownership,"Partly as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, consumers now place an increased emphasis on the importance of car ownership. This has been driven by a variety of different reasons, including a demographic move away from urban areas due to the ability to work from home and a decline in the use of public transport and shared ----- mobility (Source: BCG report). According to the OC&C survey (2021), the number of non-drivers who definitely expect to own a car in the future has risen by 21% in the UK since 2019, and 40% of drivers in the UK and Italy also stated that the COVID 19 pandemic has increased the importance they place on car ownership. This is also true of younger drivers, with the proportion of drivers aged 18 to 29 against car ownership falling from 11% to 5% during the same period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Key Trends,18.3.2,Digitalization of the used car value chain,"The used car value chain has long been reliant on physical transactions via bricks and mortar institutions, and has also had a very low digital penetration relative to other industries. However, the change towards an online business model has been accelerated, in particular as a result of and in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, which forced businesses and consumers to resort to online channels while traditional retailers were closed. This trend towards an increased digitalization has impacted both the B2B and B2C channels: _B2B Channels_ The changes in operating environment spurred by the COVID 19 pandemic have led us to accelerate our shift towards a fully digital online business model with increased focus on the functionality and usability of our digital platforms, with a 100% online penetration in UK Vehicle Remarketing and an online penetration in excess of 90% in International Vehicle Remarketing, in each case in the fiscal year 2021. Increasing online penetration of auctions presents a unique opportunity to increase the cost efficiency of used car marketplaces and facilitates a more flexible utilization of real estate. In addition, digitalization also increases businesses’ resilience in the event of further lockdowns as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic or other adverse economic conditions by continuing to trade largely online. Lastly, the digitalization of the used car value chain also bolsters operators’ data collection and analytics capabilities thanks to the higher number of transactions concluded online. This trend is likely to disproportionately benefit large players, such as ourselves, for two reasons. Firstly, because of their broader geographical presence, as digital auctions increase the scope to pair buyers and sellers that are located far away from one another, and such pairing requires significant logistical capabilities. Secondly, because of their overall scale and data infrastructure, since small players are less likely to have the digital expertise and scale to support the costs of digital investments. _B2C Channels_ Trends resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic have also accelerated consumers’ willingness to accept digital purchasing as a means to buy a car, which has historically been at very low levels according to Roland Berger. This trend has facilitated the growth of online B2C retailers, such as cinch, with an increase in transparency and convenience for consumers buying used cars, thereby potentially helping increase used car churn over time, as well as an increase in the demand for the sourcing of high quality used cars from vehicle exchanges such as ours, and in turn the demand for high quality used cars from vehicle buying platforms.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

As the growth of platforms such as WeBuyAnyCar in the UK and other C2B sourcing businesses in parts of continental Europe have shown, such vehicle buying platforms offer a convenient, transparent and efficient way for consumers to sell their cars. With consumers becoming increasingly comfortable using online channels for car transactions (Source: Roland Berger) and with such vehicle buying services still typically operating at low levels of overall market penetration, we believe that leading vehicle buying platforms can continue to exhibit structural growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

A confluence of technological changes, such as more cost efficient batteries and advancement of automotive sensors, and regulatory measures, such as EU-wide fleet emission legislation to reduce light vehicle CO2 emissions has resulted in the rapid advancement of light vehicle technology on offer to consumers. In addition, other car technologies, such as autonomous driving features and advanced car connectivity, are rapidly evolving.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.5,BUSINESS Overview,18.5.1,,"We operate leading digital used vehicle marketplaces (both business to business (“B2B”) and consumer to business (“C2B”)) in the UK and B2B marketplaces in continental Europe and are a leading provider of associated automotive services, including vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. We have physical presence in 10 countries across the UK and continental Europe as well as unmatched sourcing, data, technology and logistics capabilities. As of March 28, 2021, our business comprises: - a leading B2B digital used vehicle marketplace across the UK and continental Europe, which facilitated the sale of approximately 1.5 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 1.2 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021; - a leading C2B digital used vehicle marketplace in the UK, WeBuyAnyCar, with sold volumes of 321,000 vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, reflecting the COVID 19 restrictions on the business that now has an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period); and - a leading automotive logistics service business in the UK, which moved more than 2.8 million vehicles in the UK in the fiscal year 2020 and 2.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year 2021, and stored, refurbished and processed more than 950,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020 and 675,000 in the fiscal year 2021. We estimate that for the fiscal year 2020 we came in contact with approximately one in every three vehicles in the UK (approximately 29 million touch points, of which approximately 13 million were unique vehicles out of a vehicle parc of approximately 41 million, and including approximately 24 million digital touch points). Through our digital used vehicle marketplaces (the “Marketplace”), we are a critical liquidity provider to the used vehicles market across the UK and continental Europe, matching the complex requirements of both vendors and buyers and also facilitating the purchase of individual vehicles from consumers. The Marketplace facilitates speedy disposal of high volumes of vehicles and offers a broad range of consistently graded vehicle stock, thereby providing efficiency, liquidity (i.e., fast disposal of vehicle stock) and choice. Moreover, we are the UK’s leading provider of automotive services solutions. By providing a full suite of auction and automotive services, we offer our customers solutions for almost all stages of the vehicle life-cycle, beginning as soon as the new car arrives at the port. Our scope of services provides synergistic benefits across our divisions, as our vehicle sales platforms, together with our automotive services solutions, generate vehicle and pricing data used in both our vehicle remarketing and vehicle buying operations. Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, we have accelerated our digital transition and now transact digitally almost 100% of our volumes through online channels. We integrate our digital and physical assets to provide innovative multi-service solutions, maximizing speed, intelligence and performance across our comprehensive offerings. In the fiscal year 2021, 100% (2020: 37%) of our auction volumes in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division and 96% (2020: 84%) of our auction volumes in the International Vehicle Remarketing division were transacted online, which is a testament to our successful shift towards a predominantly digital online business model moving forward. In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, we generated £253.1 million of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to £232.8 million, £204.1 million and £174.4 million in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 31, 2019, respectively. We operate through three main business lines: (i) the B2B Marketplace business line, which is comprised of our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, (ii) the C2B Marketplace business line, which is WeBuyAnyCar, our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in the UK, and (iii) the Automotive Services business line, which is accounted for in our Automotive Services division. - B2B Marketplace: B2B Marketplace is our core business that facilitates the exchange of used vehicles between vendors and buyers through primarily digital auctions. As of March 28, 2021, our digital auctions are supported by 21 physical sites in the UK (23 as of June 1, 2021) and 30 physical sites in continental Europe at which vehicles are stored, inspected, repaired and refurbished. ----- B2B Marketplace (which excludes WeBuyAnyCar) does not take title to the majority of vehicles that it sells, but instead serves as an agent between vendor and buyer and recognizes revenues through auction transaction fees as well as fees for a suite of value-added digital and physical pre- and post- auction services such as inspections, appraisals, repairs, refurbishment, imaging, storage and handling. We also purchase vehicles directly from certain corporate vendors under outsourced remarketing contracts, whereby we directly buy our vendors’ inventory and have discretion over the remarketing channel through which we sell the vehicle. B2B Marketplace takes title to such vehicles until the time of resale and recognizes revenues for the full sale value of the vehicle less the cost of acquisition. Vehicles acquired pursuant to outsourced remarketing contracts are typically resold within 15 to 30 days of acquisition and in turn generate additional revenue above the auction fees. B2B Marketplace also includes our Vehicle Buying division’s operations in continental Europe, which is focused on purchasing batches of vehicles primarily from corporates in continental Europe. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division generated £90.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £116.3 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £109.4 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our UK Vehicle Remarketing division sold approximately 867,000 vehicles (2020: 1,063,000 vehicles; 2019: 1,030,0000 vehicles). In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division generated £29.2 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £34.2 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £33.7 million). In the fiscal year 2021, our International Vehicle Remarketing division sold approximately 334,000 vehicles (2020: 401,000 vehicles; 2019: 388,000 vehicles). - C2B Marketplace: C2B Marketplace is our C2B vehicle buying business which operates in the UK through WeBuyAnyCar. WeBuyAnyCar purchases used vehicles directly from consumers, leveraging its proprietary online pricing quotation systems and efficient physical inspection processes to facilitate purchases from such consumers. WeBuyAnyCar has carried out a total of 2.2 million vehicle purchases since its inception in 2006, and in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar recorded more than 22 million unique visitors to its website and performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online. As of March 28, 2021, WeBuyAnyCar operates in 357 locations across the UK, which are located within an average drive time of under 14 minutes to customers. In addition, WeBuyAnyCar offers swift services to its consumers, allowing them to obtain a quote in under 60 seconds and to then subsequently receive monies for the purchase of their vehicle within 30 minutes of the sale being concluded. C2B Marketplace remarkets the vehicles it purchases exclusively through B2B Marketplace within approximately 10 days and accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. This allows us to actively manage the volumes and mix on the Marketplace, while helping to de-risk the supply of vehicles to the auction. C2B Marketplace’s consistent and growing profitability over the past years demonstrates our ability to generate “metal margin” (accounted for in our Vehicle Buying division) on C2B vehicles in addition to core auction buyer fees (accounted for in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division). Vehicles sourced via our C2B Marketplace therefore result in higher profitability per vehicle for the CA Group. Our sophisticated and proprietary pricing mechanism and real-time market data enable us to more accurately price the purchase of vehicles to generate a profitable onward sale. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Vehicle Buying division generated £44.0 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £27.7 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £24.1 million), which was predominantly generated through C2B Marketplace (i.e., WeBuyAnyCar). - Automotive Services: Automotive Services provides vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment in the UK. With our refurbishment offering (which has a 250,000 yearly vehicle refurbishment capacity), we are able to bring vehicles to either wholesale standard or a “Retail Ready” standard (which refers to vehicles that are cosmetically and mechanically prepared to be immediately placed for sale to end consumers and are therefore particularly attractive to online car dealers). These standards increase prices achieved at auction and render it simpler for dealers to on-sell the vehicle to consumers. We seek to develop a relationship with vendors and endeavor to act as a one-stop shop for vehicles throughout the majority of their lifecycle, expanding our revenue streams along the value chain and also positioning ourselves to be the preferred provider of remarketing services when the vehicles come off lease or roll out of the fleet. Our overall infrastructure and logistics network allow us to efficiently cover all key locations and major transport hubs in the UK. Automotive Services helps maximize the benefit of operational leverage and intragroup efficiencies derived from the wide-ranging scope of services offered, benefitting both our customers as well as our own operations. ----- Automotive Services generates revenue in the form of service fees. In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, Automotive Services generated £12.5 million of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA (aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020: £22.6 million; 52-week period ended March 31, 2019: £19.1 million).",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

We believe our leading market positioning and scale enable us to better serve used car buyers and sellers compared to many of our competitors as we are able to price, source, inspect, refurbish, transport, service, market, arrange auctions and provide digital and physical services and solutions in an efficient, comprehensive and effective way. We believe our B2B Marketplace is the largest used vehicle auction operator across the UK and continental Europe combined, with approximately £10 billion in gross merchandise value in connection with sales for the fiscal year 2020. We believe that B2B Marketplace is the clear leader in the UK, having sold approximately 1.1 million vehicles in the UK in the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, as well as approximately 400,000 vehicles sold in continental Europe in the same period. These attributes mean that we can continuously meet the requirements of both professional vendors and buyers, including improved value, liquidity, efficiency and choice, and are a key part of the reason that more than 25,000 active buyers used the exchange in the fiscal year 2021. Through our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, our Automotive Services offering in the UK and our brand WeBuyAnyCar, we come into contact with approximately one third of all vehicles exchanged in the UK each year. We believe that C2B Marketplace, through our brand WeBuyAnyCar, is the leading vehicle buying service in the UK, purchasing and selling over 321,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2020. On an annualized basis based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period, we purchased and sold approximately 461,000 vehicles through WeBuyAnyCar. With greater than 22 million unique visitors to its website in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2021 and having performed approximately 15.6 million valuations online and purchasing vehicles at 357 physical sites, each as of and for the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, we believe that C2B Marketplace is significantly larger and has a significantly greater presence than any other vehicle buying service in the UK. C2B Marketplace’s leadership position is continuing to strengthen with an increase in the number of repeat customers in recent years, demonstrating consumers’ trust in the brand and satisfaction around the value attached to the vehicle disposal process. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, WeBuyAnyCar has over 100,000 Trust Pilot reviews with an average 4.6 rating. In Automotive Services, we operate one of the largest automotive vehicle movement, logistics, storage, predelivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment capability in the UK. As of March 28, 2021, we own the largest transporter fleet in the UK, comprising 901 trucks capable of providing bulk vehicle movements, thereby connecting the physical marketplace and increasing the integration between our divisions. We also offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through the process of vehicle delivery, handover and collection. In the fiscal year 2021, we moved 2.4 million vehicles (2020: 2.8 million), including 563,000 single vehicle movements, and our in-house and sub-contracted transporter fleet completed 94% of transport arranged for customers by the UK Vehicle Remarketing division. ----- We offer the full range of single vehicle movement services to support customers through the process of vehicle delivery, handover and collection. We also operate one of the UK’s largest inspect and collect businesses with over 400,000 vehicle inspections made in the fiscal year 2021, are one of the UK’s leading new vehicle storage handling and preparation businesses and are among the UK’s leading de-fleet, refurbishment and alloy wheel businesses with more than 675,000 vehicles stored, refurbished and processed in the fiscal year 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Strengths,18.7.2,Superior Business Model Addressing the Full Value Chain and Difficult to Replicate,"We operate under a marketplace model and benefit from self-reinforcing dynamics where each of our business lines feeds into and reinforces the others. Our business model enables us to extract intragroup efficiencies and synergies derived from operating across almost all stages of the vehicle life-cycle, at high volumes sufficient to provide a level of information, liquidity and market recognition that drives further volume growth. Our B2B Marketplace operates vehicle auctions that bring together vendors with a highly fragmented and diverse buyer base. Our large, robust and transparent digital platforms combined with our full suite of preand post-auction digital and physical value-added services provide an efficient marketplace to facilitate the exchange of used vehicles. B2B Marketplace sold approximately 1.5 million vehicles across the UK and continental Europe in the fiscal year 2020. This significant scale creates a virtuous business cycle by providing access to a wide variety and large volume of vehicles through our auctions, thereby attracting more buyers to our platform and enabling optimum pricing and quick throughput, which in turn attracts more sellers and provides more volumes. Moreover, we obtain valuable insights for our pricing engines based on the information we have available about a vehicle and its condition, color, auction sale price and bid levels. The B2B Marketplace benefits from multiple sourcing channels targeting different types of vendors. The C2B Marketplace creates a highly complementary and enhancing growth engine to that of the B2B Marketplace. The B2B Marketplace provides WeBuyAnyCar with a highly efficient route to dispose of the vehicles it purchases from consumers (typically within 10 days) and, through WeBuyAnyCar, we have the ability to purchase a greater volume and variety of vehicles, which directly helps supply the B2B Marketplace. The Vehicle Buying division provides significant volumes to the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, having accounted for 35% of the vehicles sold through the Marketplace in the UK in the fiscal year 2021. This synergistic model, which leverages WeBuyAnyCar’s market share within the framework of our wider marketplace, creates a platform which we believe would be difficult to replicate. Our ability to dynamically source used vehicles combined with our knowledge and insights on pricing and other demand side dynamics enable us to find an optimum and tailored match for buyers and sellers swiftly, which is key in driving profitability per vehicle. This is further strengthened by the additional services we offer, which increase consumer and vendor experience as well as help us generate greater profitability per vehicle. Our scaled B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace provides our pricing model with over six million relevant historic used vehicle transactions. This data enables us to accurately and efficiently price vehicles both upon sourcing and sale. This scale is further supported by our Automotive Services business line and our full suite of pre- and post-auction digital and physical value-added services. This completes the value chain allowing us to cover the full life-cycle, deepen relationships with vendors and customers and maximize profitability per vehicle. Moreover, our Automotive Services business line and our value-added services enable us to record ----- information relating to vehicle condition, maintenance and upkeep, further contributing to the pricing model and further supporting the reliability of pricing decisions. With the launch of B2C Marketplace, outside the restricted group, we have further diversified our buyer and vendor base as cinch acts as another buyer through our auction channel, thereby generating auction fees for our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as additional income for our Automotive Services division. Furthermore, cinch also generates additional supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that are remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related _Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.”_ As the scale of each of the business lines has grown and has reached greater volumes and touch points, it has contributed to the further growth of each of the business lines in a virtuous cycle. We believe we are the only operator of digital used vehicle auctions in the UK and continental Europe that offers the scale and the range of services we provide. Our advantages in scale, reputation, relationships, access to proprietary data as well as our established infrastructure and logistics network, which we believe would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Strengths,18.7.3,Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation,"We believe that our scale, unique business model, reputation and robust financial policies have contributed significantly to our long-term financial resilience, attractive growth and cash flow generation profile. Despite turbulent times such as the global financial crisis of 2008, we were able to consistently maintain and grow volumes and our EBITDA metric (as defined and prepared on the basis of the accounting policies of the relevant parent entity at the time), with such metric having grown at a CAGR of 14.3% from the fiscal year ended December 2004 to fiscal year ended March 2020 and such metric divided by vehicle volumes sold in the respective trading year having grown from £37 per vehicle sold to £137 per vehicle sold over the same period, as shown in the following chart. Our business model’s resilience to market shocks can be further evidenced by our strong organic performance. For example, during the period between 2008 and 2010, we were able to grow volumes by 66,000 vehicles and the applicable EBITDA metric by £24 million in a market backdrop of reduced used car transactions in the UK, which fell from 8.3 million in 2008 to 8.0 million in 2009 before recovering to 8.1 million in 2010. Despite a market backdrop of reduced used vehicle transactions during the fiscal year 2021, our volumes between July 2020 and December 2020 were higher compared to the period between July 2019 and December 2019. In times of a consumer downturn and due to rate of loss in value generally associated with used vehicles, liquidity is of paramount importance to businesses as well as consumers. Our business is also highly cash generative, having generated £145.9 million, £175.1 million and £202.7 million of COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively. This strong cash ----- generation is the result of our ability to grow our IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA while following a disciplined approach to capital expenditure with the majority of sites being held on long term leases (excluding WeBuyAnyCar retail locations) and most of our transporters and properties being refinanced through sale and leaseback. Adjusted cash conversion (measured by subtracting Underlying Cash CAPEX from IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA and comparing the result to IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA) was 84%, 86% and 87% in the 52-week period March 31, 2019, the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Strengths,18.7.4,"Attractive, Resilient and Underpenetrated Market","We operate in the used vehicle market across the UK and continental Europe which has grown consistently since 2012, driven by a relatively stable vehicle parc churn and growing vehicle penetration rates. Vehicle penetration rates are expected to continue to grow for most markets. In addition, the used car market is larger and more stable than the new car market. The chart below sets out the volumes of used car sales and new car sales in the UK between 2008 and 2020 as an example of the development of these market. The European vehicle parc has exhibited a CAGR of approximately 1.7% over 2012 to 2019, currently standing at approximately 320 million units as of 2020. As per projections from IHS, the European vehicle parc is expected to exhibit approximately 0.8% CAGR over 2021 to 2026, driven by growth in the penetration of vehicles per population. Assuming churn rates remain the same, this should support growth in the used car market. See “Industry—Overview—UK and Continental European Vehicle Parc.” In 2020, the European used car market was estimated to be worth €410 billion (Source: Roland Berger report _(Apr-21)). Significant fragmentation of buyers and vendors across the UK and continental Europe helps to_ make exchanges a critical channel for both vendors and buyers. For example, the largest used car dealership in the UK is limited to approximately 3% market share, while the largest continental European used car dealership has a market share of less than 1% (Source: IHS and ICDP). In addition, online vehicle buying services are still operating typically at low levels of overall market penetration (e.g., WeBuyAnyCar has ~4% share of total UK used vehicle sales volumes, as of 2020). The COVID 19 pandemic has also accelerated favorable structural trends affecting the markets in which we operate. In particular, consumers have recently begun placing increased emphasis on the importance of owning a car. This has been driven by a variety of different reasons, including people moving away from urban areas due to the ability to work from home and a reluctance to rely entirely on public transport. In addition, the lockdown measures imposed by governments and related closure of car dealerships has made digital channels a principal means of conducting used car auctions. In particular, by the start of 2021 almost all of our auctions were digital as the COVID 19 pandemic and related social distancing regulations accelerated our digitalization plans and encouraged the adoption of digital auctions by our customers. This digital shift allows us to reach a wider range of potential customers and has increased the amount of auctions being held, reducing our daily sales’ costs and allowing us and our customers to receive more vehicle data. Finally, we also benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push towards new technology, including tighter emission controls, encourages vehicle owners to renew their vehicles, driving more exchanges.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Strengths,18.7.5,Best-in-class Management Team with Successful Track Record of Delivery,"We operate with a management team that has significant experience in the automotive sector and has a proven track-record of executing value-accretive initiatives, whether organically or through acquisitions. Our Executive Chairman, Avril Palmer-Baunack, has over 25 years’ executive experience with leading businesses in the automotive, support services, industrial engineering and insurance services sectors, having previously served as Executive Chairman and Deputy CEO of Stobart Group and CEO of Autologic Holdings, where ----- she joined from Universal Salvage and also held the position of CEO. Avril was the founder of Haversham Holdings plc in 2014 and led the acquisition and strategic build of the CA Group where she continues to lead as Executive Chairman. Tim Lampert, our Chief Financial Officer, joined Autologic Holdings in 1997. Tim joined Haversham Holdings plc in January 2015 for the purchase of the BCA Group from CD&R and the subsequent acquisitions prior to the group being de-listed and sold to TDR in November 2019 and has remained as CFO with the formation of the current CA Group. Together, our best-in-class management team brings over 30 years of relationships with major participants across every layer of the UK and continental European automotive sector both at the division and group levels, and more than 100 years of collective experience in the industry across four managing directors as well as legacy knowledge from some of our founders, who are still employed within our Vehicle Buying division. Thanks to its extensive experience, our management team has a proven track record of delivery, with applicable EBITDA growing from £86.0 million in the fiscal year 2014 to £200.8 million in the fiscal year 2020 (as presented under “—Resilient Financial Profile and Strong Cash Flow Generation”) through, among others, the acquisition of multiple infrastructure and logistics businesses. During the same period, B2B Vehicle Volume increased from 999,000 to 1,463,000. Since the fiscal year 2014, C2B Vehicle Volume also increased from 144,000 to 321,000 vehicles and 300,000 vehicles in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively, with an annualized run rate of 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period), reflecting the COVID 19 restrictions on the business. The track record of our senior management in delivering cost-effective organic scale growth and successfully integrating acquisitions, is one of our key strengths in a complex and continually evolving industry. In addition, our management is backed by TDR Capital, a leading private equity firm with an integrated investment and operation team of 46 professionals with an average of 15 years of relevant experience and a deep knowledge and track-record in the automotive industry via investments in LeasePlan, CarNext, EuroGarages and International Car Washing Group. The TDR Capital team, together with management, intends to continue our trajectory of consistent volume and profitability growth. We have also created a strong culture of innovation and transparency, winning a number of industry awards for technical innovation, including for BCA Dealer Pro and our website. We believe this has allowed us to maintain a high retention rate of key staff and develop a workforce that is dedicated to delivering high-quality services.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Strengths,18.7.6,Platform Ideally Positioned for Growth,"We believe our business platform is strategically positioned for growth in our markets through market share gain from the consumer to consumer (“C2C”) and part-exchange markets (whereby consumers “trade-in” their used vehicle directly to a dealer). The growth of C2B Marketplace supports the growth of our B2B channel as WeBuyAnyCar provides us with used vehicles that would otherwise go to C2C markets or partexchanges and allows us to supply a greater volume and variety of vehicles to our B2B Marketplace. We believe we can drive higher volumes through our auctions through continued market share gain and higher auction penetration in the UK and continental Europe. Our relationships with businesses such as LeasePlan or CarNext, including entering into exclusive service agreements that provide support for our multi-channel strategy, further enhance our sourcing capabilities and drive growth in the vehicle remarketing segment. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship with LeasePlan.”Moreover, by leveraging our “One Europe” strategy via more seamless cross-border transactions, we believe we can create a truly pan-European B2B marketplace for future growth. In addition, COVID 19 restrictions have accelerated consumers’ willingness to adopt digital purchasing as a means to buy a car from current low levels, favoring the growth of online B2C retailers, such as cinch. Our relationship with cinch has increased supply for the B2B Marketplace via part-exchange vehicles that are remarketed by us and allow us to generate additional auction fees. See “Certain Relationships and Related _Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Through cinch, we are also able to develop a B2C channel,_ which enhances our position as an end-to-end service provider. In particular, sales volumes for the B2C channel increased from approximately 4,000 in October 2020 (based on a 7-day rolling annual run-rate) to approximately 38,000 in May 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Strategies,18.8.1,Enhance our competitive advantage across the value chain as an integrated end-to-end service provider,"We plan to drive growth by increasing our B2B Marketplace and C2B Marketplace penetration to increase transaction volumes and scale across our geographies. The increase in scale will serve to provide even deeper access to vehicles, as well as more pricing and vehicle information, and is expected to continue to solidify our position as a leading operator of digital used vehicle auctions across the UK and the continental European countries in which we operate. We also expect to continue leveraging upon and investing in our UK and continental European network and infrastructure. To further increase our scale, we intend to deepen our relationships with other participants in the used vehicle ecosystem, including OEMs, leasing companies, finance companies and dealers, to improve access to used vehicle supply and generate volumes. We plan to provide dealers with additional offerings that suit their business models, to leverage the strength of WeBuyAnyCar’s brand to capture additional supply volumes as consumers become increasingly willing to sell their vehicles through digital channels, and expand our reach to serve customers through partnerships with other B2C platforms. In order to maintain our competitive advantage across the value chain, we will leverage the close relationship between our C2B Marketplace and B2B Marketplace and work on integrating further the insights and data points we are able to collect at different stages, further supplemented by our data sharing agreement with cinch. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements with cinch.” Multiplying our data touchpoints for vehicles entering our ecosystem will enable us to base our decisions on more precise and efficient processes and pricing input. We intend to continue to develop both our digital and physical service offerings to retain and grow the customer base and deliver enhanced profitability. By increasing the penetration of value-added services over time, we expect a compounding effect of fueling Marketplace growth by driving supply and buyer demand, as the comprehensive end-to-end solutions significantly enhance user loyalty. We also intend to further deepen the penetration of services provided by Automotive Services to continue to improve relationships with vendors, both to provide additional vehicle information to benefit our other divisions and to become the preferred choice for vehicle remarketing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Strategies,18.8.4,Capitalize on favorable structural industry trends to accelerate our growth,"Online penetration for sales of used vehicles has grown significantly, particularly in the UK, in recent years and the associated structural trends further accelerated during the COVID 19 pandemic. During the COVID 19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in online penetration for sales of used vehicles, as physical venues were shut for lockdown periods and social distancing restrictions and health concerns otherwise caused many consumers to avoid physical venues. Despite the recent acceleration in online ----- penetration growth, we believe the online used car market remains underpenetrated relative to other mass retail markets such as markets for toys and games, consumer electronics and apparel. Further enhancing our digital presence will also allow us to capitalize on additional structural trends that could drive more volumes through our Marketplace and strengthen our positioning and market share on both the supply and demand sides of the ecosystem. In particular, we believe that on the demand side consumers will continue to favor used vehicles for individual transportation to avoid public transportation systems, and that more vehicles will be necessary as consumers move away from city centers to areas where public transportation is inconvenient or unavailable. On the demand side, we look to attract wider audiences via our digital auctions with no limitations linked to historical physical sites. Finally, we will seek to benefit from increasing sales of used vehicles as government support and a push towards new technology, including towards electric and other alternative fuel sources for vehicles, encourages vehicle owners to review their vehicles, driving more exchanges.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Operations,18.9.1,Vehicle Remarketing,"Vehicle Remarketing is comprised of the UK Vehicle Remarketing division and the International Vehicle Remarketing division. Together, these divisions operate close to accessible transport routes and facilitate the exchange of used vehicles, having sold 1.2 million, 1.5 million and 1.4 million vehicles in the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively (with fiscal year 2021 being the period most adversely affected by the COVID 19 pandemic). In the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, Vehicle Remarketing sold 1.4 million vehicles. Vehicle Remarketing generated IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £119.7 million in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021. Vehicle Remarketing operates primarily on an agency basis (in such role, taking no title or inventory risk to the vehicles it transacts), except for our outsourced remarketing contracts which allow us to selectively secure batches of supply. Vehicle Remarketing generates its revenue through a mix of vehicle transaction fees and value-added service fees. During the fiscal year 2020, approximately 37% of UK auctions were transacted online, however, by the start of the fiscal year 2021 all our UK auctions were digital as the COVID 19 pandemic and related social distancing regulations accelerated our digitalization plans and encouraged the acceptance of digital auctions by our customers. While we retain the option to conduct one-off physical auctions for certain customers, we will continue to focus on digital auctions. As a result, many of our physical sites are now being used for the provision of storage and refurbishment services to our customers in support of our digital auctions. In addition, the digital shift has increased auction capacity, reduced our daily sales’ costs and provides us with more data. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Operations,18.9.2,Auctions,"Auctions are our core business activity. We auction vehicles of all ages and types, principally cars and light commercial vehicles (“LCVs”), selling 1.4 million vehicles in the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, a period adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, compared to 1.5 million in the fiscal year 2020. As part of our auctions, transaction fees are charged per vehicle sold through the Marketplace and are received from both buyers and vendors, with the vast majority generated from buyers. Vehicle Remarketing does not take title to the majority of vehicles (with title instead passing from the vendor directly to the buyer). Online auctions are conducted as real time online auction sales with the auctioneer providing descriptions to the buyers and coordinating the auction. We also offer “eBay-style” longer-term online auctions in which users can either purchase vehicles from our online catalogue at a pre-determined asking price (a “Buy Now” service) or bid on vehicles during auctions that run for pre-set periods of time (a “Bid Now”service). Auctions are conducted daily and both vendors and buyers benefit from their 24/7 access to online bidding and the ability to search and compare vehicles from multiple locations and in multiple languages. Auctions can be accessed using BCA Live Online or the BCA Buyer mobile application. _BCA Live Online_ BCA Live Online broadcasts live video and audio to remote bidders via the Internet using technology developed in-house, allowing online bidders to compete in real time. Buyers can pre-plan their auction activity using our catalogue previews and the vehicle tracking functionality on our BCA Buyer mobile application, allowing buyers to track in real-time when a vehicle will be up for live auction. During a sale, a live messaging service allows buyers to engage directly with the auctioneers and there is capability to follow up to four auction sales simultaneously. If buyers are unable to attend a given auction, they are also offered the option to place concealed proxy bids, allowing them to place a set bid for a particular vehicle in advance, prior to the end of the relevant auction. BCA Live Online also allows potential buyers to view, bid on and ultimately purchase vehicles at auctions across Europe from one location, eliminating the need to travel to physical auction sites. _BCA Buyer Mobile Application_ Our BCA Buyer mobile application integrates with BCA Live Online to allow industry buyers to manage their selections and bidding across platforms. Simple vehicle tracking takes the guesswork out of auction timings, with prompted notifications automatically sent to buyers whose targeted vehicle is ten lots away. The use of our BCA Buyer mobile application has increased over the past two years and it now offers the same functionalities as BCA Live Online, including full bidding, buying, delivery, collection and payment journeys.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Operations,18.9.3,Vendors,"The UK Vehicle Remarketing division’s vendors are divided into five main groups: (i) dealers, comprising 23% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021, (ii) vehicle buying, comprising 35% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021, (iii) OEMs, comprising 7% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021, (iv) corporates, which include leasing companies and OEM finance companies, comprising 21% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021 and (v) trade and others, comprising 15% of our volume for the fiscal year 2021. The majority of used vehicles in the wholesale market in key European geographies is generated by OEMs and corporates, although there are some country-specific differences. The majority of our sales arrangements with our vendors are framework agreements, renewed annually and provide only pricing and service levels. The framework agreements do not guarantee the provision of a minimum number of vehicles to us and typically do not commit the vendor to exclusively supply vehicles to us. Nevertheless, we have a track record of vendor retention. As of March 28, 2021, we held long-term client relationships with an impressive track record of retention of our customers; by vehicles sold, 13 of our top 18 vendors (excluding WeBuyAnyCar) have each worked with us for five or more years and ten of them have worked with us for over ten years. In particular, for the fiscal year 2021, of the top 18 vendor relationships (excluding WeBuyAnyCar) 77% of volume was contributed by vendors with a relationship over ten years. _Dealers_ Dealer vendors are comprised of a large number of franchised and non-franchised dealers. Dealers typically sell vehicles obtained through part-exchanges from consumers, as well as over-age stock that is no longer suitable for their retail showrooms. As a result, dealers sell vehicles through us that typically are more than five years old. ----- _WeBuyAnyCar_ WeBuyAnyCar sells all of its vehicles through the Marketplace. See “—Vehicle Buying.” The age of vehicles we sell varies widely. _OEMs_ OEMs typically use the Marketplace to dispose of demo fleets, buy-backs from rental companies and management vehicles. As a result, the vehicles sold by OEMs through us tend to be among the youngest sold through the Marketplace and usually are less than two years old. _Corporates_ Corporate vendors, including contract hire, leasing and finance companies, typically dispose of end-of-lease or repossessed vehicles through the Marketplace. Leasing company vendors in particular typically seek to liquidate vehicles that they no longer seek to lease (and thus view as liabilities) as quickly as possible through the Marketplace. The supply of vehicles from corporate vendors is affected by the number of vehicles that have reached the end of the life of their relevant underlying contracts (which are typically three to five years in duration), and reflects the number of vehicles taken onto contract by such corporate vendors’ customers in preceding years. _Trade and others_ Trade and others are comprised of other companies that do not fall into the other main categories, such as public sector suppliers, owned fleet and various other independent sellers of vehicles.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Our trade buyers are divided into two main groups: (i) franchised dealers, who use the Marketplace and vehicles obtained from part-exchanges as a source to supplement inventory, and (ii) independent dealers and wholesale traders. Our independent dealer buyers will make use of remarketing companies for a constant supply of vehicles. Wholesale traders are dispersed through a large number of individual and small companies which source vehicles from auctions and act as middlemen on behalf of other buyers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Operations,18.9.5,Value-Added Services,"In addition to our core auction business, Vehicle Remarketing provides a wide spectrum of supplemental, value-added digital and physical pre- and post-auction services to both vendors and buyers, ranging from upstream services to pre-auction preparation and marketing products to post-auction logistics services. These services enable vendors to select from a range of services to enhance the marketability of vehicles, thereby facilitating their disposal process, while also improving the information available to buyers. Value-added services have the additional benefit of enhancing customer retention rates within Vehicle Remarketing, as our customers are able to obtain the wide range of services from a single source, as opposed to having to turn to different providers for each service which results in additional costs and lead times to disposal. Value-added service fees are charged depending on the particular type of service sold by Vehicle Remarketing. Some of the value-added services within Vehicle Remarketing are also offered on a standalone basis as part of our Automotive Services division, thereby affording us flexibility as to whether these services should be offered as part of our remarketing offering or separately and allowing us to offer more bespoke solutions to our customers based on their specific needs. The chart below shows our services across the post-factory automotive market value chain. ----- _Upstream Services_ In order to help dealers manage their part-exchanges, we have developed BCA Dealer Pro, an online application that organizes and improves various stages of the part-exchange process. BCA Dealer Pro also assists dealers in disposing of their vehicles through the Marketplace quickly and seamlessly, as the data captured by BCA Dealer Pro is easily integrated into our auction platforms. The key services addressed by BCA Dealer Pro are: - data capture facilitating valuation—identifying the vehicle, conducting an appraisal, capturing retail-quality images and obtaining an accurate valuation; - stock management—managing dealer stock and inter-dealer allocations, providing data analysis tools and retail inventory data feeds and assisting in stock liquidation and stock replacement; - remarketing services—managing logistics, sales preparation and demand data; - buyer services—providing transparent pricing, logistics and vehicle preparation; and - merchandising—offering digital content upload, key retailing data, imaging and video. In continental Europe, we have developed MarketPrice, a service that provides dealers with a valuation for their part-exchange vehicles. MarketPrice is available at no charge to dealers, in exchange for a commitment to sell part-exchange vehicles through the Marketplace. While BCA Dealer Pro and MarketPrice generate relatively low revenue and are offered prior to any decision to sell a vehicle through the Marketplace, we believe these online tools help to develop our relationship with vendors and incentivize them to provide vehicles to the Marketplace for sale. We believe that vendors using these online applications are more likely to subsequently provide a greater proportion of their vehicles to the Marketplace for sale, thus increasing the number of vehicles sold through the Marketplace. _Pre-auction Services_ Once a vendor has decided to sell a vehicle through the Marketplace, we provide vendors with a fully integrated vehicle pre-auction service. We offer vehicle collection and transportation services, primarily in the UK, to move vendors’ vehicles to the Marketplace (or, if requested, to third-party de-fleeting locations). We also provide vendors with storage services prior to the auction. Moreover, we organize both single and multiple vehicle collections, varying pricing depending on the distance and number of vehicles moved. We utilize a combination of our own fleet of transporters and contracted plate drivers, as well as third-party companies (that provide their own transporters and plate drivers). When a vehicle arrives at our facilities, we undertake a standardized appraisal of the vehicle’s condition to help the vendor set an appropriate reserve price and ensure an accurate and consistent vehicle description is provided to auction participants. Depending on a vehicle’s condition, Vehicle Remarketing offers a range of services to vendors designed to improve a vehicle’s condition and maximize its resale value, as many buyers seek ready-to-retail vehicles. For more extensive repair needs, Vehicle Remarketing offers Smart Repair, our repair service that includes cosmetic improvements, body work, dent repair, light mechanical repair, glass repair and tire replacement. Following any valet or repair services performed on a vehicle, we are able to capture high-quality photographs and video for display on BCA Auction View, the online search tool used by buyers across the Marketplace. ----- BCA Auction View provides our buyers with free access to the search capability, including all vehicles scheduled for sale through the Marketplace. We have organized our search function to allow potential buyers to search and view vehicles by make, age, grade, fuel, color, transmission and several other criteria. In addition, BCA Auction View provides users with comprehensive vehicle data, including images, videos and appraisal reports. Our video streaming and software development subsidiary, AutosOnShow, further enhances our offering by providing imaging services to dealers following the sale of a vehicle, thereby allowing such dealers to market the vehicle with their own branding prior to taking physical delivery of the vehicle. Through BCA Assured, we provide buyers with additional comfort on the condition of vehicles that would typically be sold “as seen” at our auctions. BCA Assured is a 40+point mechanical appraisal carried out by certified technicians on all vehicles within certain mileage and ownership conditions. During the appraisal, our technicians asses each vehicle in accordance with a comprehensive auction grid that takes into account a number of cosmetic and technical requirements and produce an imaging suite, following which our dedicated algorithm grades each vehicle for valuation purposes. The BCA Assured check is offered as an additional service that accompanies a bid and is designed to give potential buyers confidence to buy despite an inability to road test vehicles. The BCA Assured inspection covers a wide range of checks from condition of tires, to engine performance and brake checks. Buyers of BCA Assured-covered vehicles have the earlier of 48 hours or 500 miles to contact us if a vehicle’s condition has been misreported, with our dispute resolution team working with buyers to resolve any claims. _Post-auction Services_ Following a vehicle’s sale, we provide buyers with both storage and delivery services to the vehicle’s final destination. Through BCA Partner Finance, we offer stock funding (trade finance) to certain registered dealers in the UK, which incrementally enhances the liquidity of the buyer base, thereby stimulating further demand within the Marketplace. For eligible customers, our buyer finance services can be used to fully fund vehicle purchases of all grades, including auction costs and ancillary fees. Typically, we provide finance support to established buyers that are pre-approved and have a specified credit limit. As a result, and due to our close relationship with these buyers and the use of our proprietary credit scoring process, we are well-positioned to assess the credit risk of our borrowers and as such default rates and bad debt for BCA Partner Finance is low. Financing is provided for an initial period of 60 days, with a possible 60-day extension, and is secured by the financed vehicle (in the form of a security marker on such vehicle) as well as personal guarantees. If a dealer defaults on its interest or principal payment, we have the right to recover the financed vehicle. However, typically, we receive repayment once a vehicle is re-sold by the buyer. Part-funding for BCA Partner Finance is provided by the Receivables Facility, as defined in and described under “Description of Other Financial Arrangements—Receivables Facility Agreement.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Operations,18.9.7,WeBuyAnyCar,"In the UK, we conduct our Vehicle Buying operations through our trusted digital brand, WeBuyAnyCar. The service has over 100,000 Trust Pilot reviews, and an overall “Excellent” rating, which is testament to the strength and reputation of the WeBuyAnyCar brand. WeBuyAnyCar purchases and thereby provides us with used vehicles owned by private consumers that would otherwise be destined for the consumer-to-consumer or part-exchange markets. Through our online pricing quotation system and our 357 physical locations across the UK as of March 28, 2021, we purchase any used vehicle owned by a private consumer, irrespective of vehicle make, model, age or condition after having done our customary vehicle inspections. In the fiscal year 2021, a period adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic, WeBuyAnyCar purchased and sold 300,000 vehicles from consumers in the UK. Run-rate total number of vehicles purchased and sold through WeBuyAnyCar are estimated to be approximately 461,000 vehicles (based on trading in March, April and May 2021, which was the most recent three-month period). ----- Our Vehicle Buying division targets sellers who are seeking a fast, safe and convenient alternative to sell their used vehicles at a competitive price. We also provide sellers with a quick source of liquidity. _WeBuyAnyCar Sale Process_ WeBuyAnyCar’s website (www.webuyanycar.com) is the first point of interaction for most of the Vehicle Buying division’s sellers. We have built and continue to maintain the WeBuyAnyCar brand through television, radio and Internet advertising campaigns. WeBuyAnyCar’s website attracted approximately 22.7 million unique visitors in the fiscal year 2021. The website’s key feature is its ability to use a proprietary pricing engine that analyzes various vehicle parameters to provide an initial valuation of a vehicle virtually instantly. As a result, we believe that WeBuyAnyCar is able to provide competitive valuations to its sellers. In the fiscal year 2021, WeBuyAnyCar provided a total of 15.6 million valuations. Having obtained an initial valuation of their vehicle online, potential sellers are invited to schedule an appointment at one of WeBuyAnyCar’s 357 retail branches located across the UK, with appointments available as early as the same day. Potential sellers may also bring their vehicles direct to a WeBuyAnyCar branch, without first accessing its website, to obtain a quote on their vehicle. WeBuyAnyCar’s branches are open for both online appointments and walk-in valuations up to seven days a week, and on average a WeBuyAnyCar customer lives within a 14-minute drive of a WeBuyAnyCar branch. At the in-branch appointment, a WeBuyAnyCar representative inspects the vehicle to confirm that the online description and specifications provided by the potential seller (if applicable) were accurate and checks for other mechanical and cosmetic damage to the vehicle. The WeBuyAnyCar representative then issues a final offer price to the potential seller to buy the vehicle. The entire in-person sale process is typically completed within 30 minutes. After a seller accepts WeBuyAnyCar’s offer price, WeBuyAnyCar cross-checks the vehicle against vehicle databases and confirms the seller’s ownership. WeBuyAnyCar then arranges for the transfer of ownership and payment of the agreed purchase price for the vehicle is made by bank transfer. For an additional fee, WeBuyAnyCar will make an expedited payment transfer of the net purchase payment to the seller. WeBuyAnyCar deducts a transaction fee from the final sale price paid to the sellers of the vehicles it purchases. All of the vehicles purchased by WeBuyAnyCar are sold through the UK Vehicle Remarketing division. WeBuyAnyCar is the UK Vehicle Remarketing division’s largest vendor, providing 35% of the vehicles sold through us in the fiscal year 2021. In the fiscal year 2020, which is representative of our ordinary course business operations in a steady state, vehicles in the UK were onwards sold within approximately 10 days through the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, while in the fiscal year 2021, as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, onwards sales took place at an average of approximately 20 days.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

These business lines are interlinked, with the Vehicle Remarketing divisions re-selling all of the vehicles acquired by the Vehicle Buying division and the Automotive Services division providing vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting services and refurbishment services. Our divisions are also interlinked through end-to-end data flows, in order to optimize the platform. At each vehicle touch point throughout the value chain, data on the vehicle is collected which informs decisions on value, condition and refurbishment requirements. We have a dedicated team of data scientists and have been able to utilize their data pool to develop highly accurate pricing capabilities based on multiple vehicle parameters, including age, mileage, color and condition, which enables us to maximize margins in real time. Today, more than 6 million historic used vehicle transactions feed our pricing model, which empowers the broader platform. We have physical sites spanning the UK and across nine continental European countries, including in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, Italy and Norway, but serve customers across an even wider region. In the fiscal year 2020, we exported more than 70,000 vehicles from our International Vehicle Remarketing division, to over 40 different countries.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Automotive Services,18.10.1,,"In the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the Automotive Services division generated IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA of £12.5 million. With a national network of sites, the Automotive Services division brings together our automotive vehicle movement, logistics, storage, pre-delivery inspections, fleet management, de-fleeting and refurbishment services, providing a comprehensive suite of services in an integrated manner. The division continues to increase the penetration of internal moves and refurbishment completed for the UK Vehicle Remarketing division and WeBuyAnyCar, driving increased internal efficiency and reducing costs. Under our Automotive Services division, we aim to act as a one-stop shop for the passage of vehicles throughout their life and capture auction volumes earlier in the life-cycle by working directly with specific vendors, such as fleet providers and OEMs. By locking in a relationship with vendors at the start of the car’s life cycle, we not only expand our opportunity for revenue streams along the value chain but also place ourselves to be a potential route of remarketing when the vehicle comes off lease or rolls out of the fleet. As part of the Automotive Services division, we handle bulk vehicle movements to and from ports, manufacturing centers, pre-delivery inspection facilities, storage and refurbishment centers, auction sites and dealerships, on behalf of our third party customers, the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, BCA Partner ----- Finance customers and WeBuyAnyCar. Collected vehicles are driven on transport vehicles to secure central hub locations and the movement between hubs is performed by the transporter fleet. This hub and spoke network reduces driver hours, the risks to vehicles, general wear and tear and allows us to maximize the use of capacity in under-utilized or empty return legs. In addition, movement between hubs can occur overnight when the road network is less congested and external customers’ sites are not operational. Continued investment has resulted in a modern and efficient fleet of transporters, improving operational comfort for our employees and reliability for our customers. As of March 28, 2021, we operated a leading UK transporter fleet, comprising 901 trucks capable of providing bulk vehicle movements, thereby connecting the physical marketplace and increasing the integration between our divisions. In the fiscal year 2021, our in-house transporter fleet and sub-contractors organized by us moved 1.8 million vehicles in bulk and accounted for 94% of transport arranged by the UK Vehicle Remarketing division. We also offer single vehicle movements, customer handover specialists and vehicle inspection and collection services as well as trade plate movements for LCVs. In the fiscal year 2021, our single vehicle movements amounted to a further 563,000 vehicles moved. Furthermore, as part of our Automotive Services offering, we provide new vehicle support to customers from factory gate or port of entry to fleet or retail availability. Such services include reception, customs management and handling at port or factory gate, pre-delivery inspection and new vehicle preparation, accessory fitment and customization, warranty and servicing as well as storage and compound management. We also offer specialist services in fleet management, de-fleet and refurbishment. Our fleet management expertise gives us the capabilities to offer customers full service fleet management solutions, providing consistently high levels of customer service and peace of mind for fleet customers, including (i) booking, management and administration, (ii) preparation, maintenance and storage, (iii) document management and reporting and (iv) handover, inspection and collection services. Our de-fleet and refurbishment services include (i) inspection and estimation services, (ii) refurbishment, (iii) service and warranty, (iv) studio quality imaging, (v) valet and secure storage and (vi) wheel refurbishment. These services are delivered to consistent standards, at scale, and cost-effectively. In the fiscal year 2021, we utilized the capability and expertise developed in preparing and refurbishing fleet vehicles to establish and support the newly-developed “Retail Ready”industry vehicle standard. “Retail Ready”vehicles are cosmetically and mechanically prepared to be immediately placed for sale to consumers and are therefore particularly attractive to online car dealers. Some of our services within the Automotive Services division are also cross-sold to our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, thereby affording us flexibility as to whether these services should be directly offered to the customer or cross-sold to another division and allowing us to offer more bespoke solutions to our customers based on their specific needs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

and (h) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, any Senior Lender, Second Lien Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, except that each of them shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the making by it of that transfer.

The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Guarantee is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_ The Note Guarantee provided by the Parent (together with the Subsidiary Guarantees, the “Guarantees”) and the Subsidiary Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate upon: (1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor or of a Holding Company thereof, such that such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture; (2) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance”and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;” (4) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only (other than a Subsidiary Guarantee issued on the Issue Date), to the extent that the relevant Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees and _Collateral,” upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge of Indebtedness referred to in such_ paragraph; (5) in the case of any Note Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity, pursuant to the provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown;” (6) upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes; or (7) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our secured Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Parent, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of any future Subsidiaries of the Parent that do not become Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to release a security interest created by the Security Documents at the direction of the Trustee that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Parent in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the _Guarantees—The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted or will be granted as security for the Notes, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.”_ The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement and the Trustee for the Notes have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited, as Security Agent, in each case to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which the security agent is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which the Security Agent is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date on which the applicable Notes are issued, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or, in the case of a Successor Company, on or after the date of assumption by the Successor Company of the Issuer’s obligations hereunder). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is emailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; ----- (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly wire to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in an aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least £100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the Change of Control Payment will be no earlier than 30 days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is emailed. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the applicable series of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the applicable series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of the applicable series, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. ----- A Change of Control will result in a right to require repayment of outstanding loans under the Senior Facilities and the Second Lien Facility. Future debt of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer, may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Parent or the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s and the Parent’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.”_ In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or _substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change_ of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the preceding paragraph, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the difference will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Parent elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of £33.0 million and 13.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Parent will be required to make an offer (or procure an offer is made) (an “Asset _Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Parent so elects, to all holders or lenders of other_ outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to prepay or purchase (as applicable) the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be prepaid or purchased (as applicable) out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of prepayment or purchase (as applicable), in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable.

If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered by Holders and Pari Passu Indebtedness of its holders or lenders prepaid in any Asset Disposition Offer, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness to be prepaid or purchased (as applicable) on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool-factor on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be prepaid or purchased (as applicable), or by such other method as (i) the Trustee and (ii) the trustee, agent or similar representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, after consultation with the Parent, deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal, depositary and exchange requirements). For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in pound sterling, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Parent that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined herein).

No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Parent will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it so elects, any Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be prepaid or purchased (as applicable) pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered by the Holders or accepted by holders or lenders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness, for prepayment or purchase (as applicable), the Notes and all Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or accepted (as applicable) in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered by the Holders or accepted by holders or lenders of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness for prepayment or purchase (as applicable) and ----- not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered or accepted (as applicable) and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered or accepted (as applicable) and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Parent or the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Parent will comply (or procure compliance), to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Parent will comply (or procure compliance) with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 90 days after being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate signed by an authorized representative of the Parent indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status and what action the Parent is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note (including any foreign tax withheld and additional amounts paid in respect thereof) will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You generally will be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. Interest on the Notes will be payable in pound sterling. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the pound sterling received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollar. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the pound sterling so received). If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or ----- - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election. In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the pound sterling received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above).",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Your adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note with pound sterling, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the pound sterling paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable disposition for pound sterling, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the pound sterling received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the Notes are traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, pound sterling paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollar at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you may elect the settlement date treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Except with respect to foreign currency gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in pound sterling on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchases and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: - a broker or dealer in securities or currencies; - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a real estate investment trust; - a tax-exempt organization; - an insurance company; - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle; - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for his securities; - a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement (or an investor in such an entity or arrangement); - a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or - a U.S. expatriate. This summary is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any ----- rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, the alternative minimum tax or the effects of any U.S. state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

The Exchange is a recognized stock exchange for these purposes. The Notes will be treated for these purposes as listed on the Exchange where they are admitted to trading on the Exchange and are included in the Official List of the Exchange in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in countries in the EEA. Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK tax where the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes at the time the payment is made that (i) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a UK resident company, (ii) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a non-UK resident company that carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment and the payment is one that the non-UK resident company is required to bring into account when calculating its profits subject to UK corporation tax or (iii) the person to whom the payment is made is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out in Sections 935-937 of the Income Tax Act 2007, provided that in each case HMRC has not given a direction, the effect of which is that the payment may not be made without that withholding or deduction. In most other cases, interest will generally be paid by the Issuer under deduction of UK tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) unless the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HMRC in respect of such relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty. If interest were paid under deduction of UK tax (e.g., if the Notes are not or cease to be listed on the Exchange and no other relief or exemption is available), holders of the Notes who are not resident in the UK may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty.

However, interest and premium, if any, paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK tax will not be assessed to UK tax in the hands of holders (other than certain trustees) who are not resident for tax purposes in the UK, except where (a) the holder of the Notes carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency, or in the case of a corporate holder, carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the UK, and (b) the interest and premium, if any, is received in connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that branch, agency or permanent establishment. There are exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers). Holders of the Notes should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in “Description of the Notes-Additional Amounts” above would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled to the relevant interest to UK tax.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1743,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND LOCAL LAW LIMITATIONS,1743.1,England and Wales,1743.1.1,United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU,"Following a national referendum in June 2016, the UK exercised its right pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on the EU to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU and ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“Exit Day”). As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the Recast Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under that EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA. On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a member state of the EU, including for the purpose of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a member state of EU. The Recast Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019) (the “Insolvency _Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings_ under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, providing for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the Recast Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the Recast Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings. The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP Day Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and: - the center of the debtor’s main interests is in the UK; or - the center of the debtor’s main interests is in a Member State and there is an establishment in the UK. These tests are consistent with the Recast Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the UK court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there ----- to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (A) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (B) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its center of main interests is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its center of main interests in a Member State, to enter into administration.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The courts of England and Wales would have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company. In addition, the UK Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in Great Britain and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. On the Issue Date, the obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantees and the Notes will be secured by security interests over the Initial Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1743,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND LOCAL LAW LIMITATIONS,1743.1,England and Wales,1743.1.3,Administration,"The Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended, the “Insolvency Act”) and the onshored version of the Recast Insolvency Regulation (which pursuant to the Insolvency Amendment Regulations has been substantially amended) provide that an administrator may be appointed (whether in or out of court) in respect of an English company or Scottish company, a company incorporated in an EEA state, a company not incorporated in an EEA state but with its COMI in a member state of the EU (other than Denmark), a company (wherever incorporated) having its COMI in the UK or a company (wherever incorporated) with its COMI in a member state of the EU and an “establishment” in the UK. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is ----- likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow”basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable or if the following would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined herein) granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (see further below). If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, or the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1743,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND LOCAL LAW LIMITATIONS,1743.1,England and Wales,1743.1.4,Administration and Floating Charges,"As set out above, the Insolvency Act empowers the English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the ----- company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument) as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a firstranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/ 3226)), as set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1743,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND LOCAL LAW LIMITATIONS,1743.1,England and Wales,1743.1.5,Fixed and Floating Charges,"There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and, where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which include the administrator’s remuneration and can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets (provided the fixed charge holder has no notice of any restrictions); (c) provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable ----- out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security may be subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (see “—Grant of floating charge”); and (f) where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims, certain unpaid pension contributions, and VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC) and (ii) as noted above, subject to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) for unsecured creditors; and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court approval but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings; and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors would be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not ----- participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration. A scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the shareholders should prevail.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1743,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND LOCAL LAW LIMITATIONS,1743.1,England and Wales,1743.1.8,Liquidation/Winding-up,"As noted above (see “—United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU”), the Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) provides that, in addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, a company which has its center of main interests in the UK, or which has its center of main interests in a Member State and an establishment in the UK, may be subject to compulsory liquidation or (with confirmation by the court) a creditors’ voluntary liquidation in the UK. In the case of compulsory liquidation, even if a foreign company has neither its center of main interests or an establishment in the UK, it may be wound up as an unregistered company if the court considers there to be (i) a sufficient connection with England and Wales, (ii) a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (iii) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise a jurisdiction. Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of windingup: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. ----- However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined herein). Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. As a result of certain temporary changes introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, the impact of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act has been altered such that the relevant date for considering whether a disposition of property is void is no longer the date on which the petition was presented, but instead, the date on which the winding-up order was granted. Once the temporary changes cease on September 30, 2021 (or such later date as may be imposed), the relevant date is expected to return to the date on which the petition is presented. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or debt as a debt in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1743,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND LOCAL LAW LIMITATIONS,1743.1,England and Wales,1743.1.9,Priority on Insolvency,"One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as at the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies). ----- The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only; - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge; - Seventh ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. ----- See “Administration and Floating Charges” above for a description of the Prescribed Part.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company.

A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the English company enters into liquidation or administration within two years from the date on which the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings. In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the English company enters into liquidation or administration within six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date on which the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. .

Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of “financial instruments”includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under loans made by credit institutions.

Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following: _(a) Moratorium_ The Act introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements, including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). From October 1, 2021 (which may be extended by the UK government), ineligible companies will also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. From October 1, 2021 (which may be extended by the UK government), directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among other things) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern or (until October 1, 2021 (which may be extended by the UK government)) would do so were it not for any worsening of the financial position of the company for reasons relating to coronavirus. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern even if (until October 1, 2021 (which may be extended by the UK government)) one were to disregard any worsening of the financial position of the company for reasons relating to coronavirus and/or meet its financial obligations. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration and _floating charges,” “—Grant of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)_ ----- _Regulations 2003”above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted._ In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: i. pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; ii. pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; iii. automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and iv. at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). _(b) Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_ The Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new prohibition. _(c) Restructuring Plan_ The Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). ----- Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties”test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether more the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: i. the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and ii. the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette). _(d) Modification of Wrongful Trading_ The Act provided for a temporary modification to the application of liability for wrongful trading by directors with retrospective effect from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020. While this temporary modification lapsed after September 30, 2020, it was revived in the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Liability for Wrongful Trading and Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020 and thereafter extended pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2021, so that it applied from November 26, 2020 until June 30, 2021. Wrongful trading provisions create a civil offence where a director of a company that enters insolvent liquidation or administration has caused the company to continue to trade when they ----- knew or ought to have known prior to the commencement of the insolvent liquidation or administration that there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding insolvent liquidation or administration. The court may declare that such a director is liable to make a contribution to the company’s assets unless they have taken every step with a view to minimizing the potential loss to the company’s creditors as a whole. These temporary measures were intended to protect directors from personal liability where they made decisions to continue trading at a time when the risk of insolvency as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic was high. Pursuant to these provisions, the court was required to assume that a director was not responsible for any worsening of the financial position of the company or its creditors that occurred during the relevant period. There was no requirement to show that the company’s worsening financial position was due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Other provisions aimed at preventing director misconduct (such as fraudulent trading under Section 213 of the Insolvency Act, general duties of directors under the Companies Act 2006 and common law fiduciary duties) continued to apply. This temporary modification to the application of liability for wrongful trading by directors did not apply to directors of certain entities, including insurers, banks, securitization companies, parties to capital markets arrangements and overseas entities with functions corresponding to these. _(e) No winding up petitions or orders_ The Act, in tandem with the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) (No. 2) Regulations 2021, has temporarily suspended the ability of creditors to present a winding up petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and September 30, 2021 (subject to extension) on the basis of a company’s inability to pay its debts, unless the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that the COVID 19 pandemic did not have a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have existed even if the COVID 19 pandemic had not had a financial effect on the company. With regards to petitions that have been presented during this period but before the Act came into force, the court can make such order as it thinks appropriate to restore the position to what it would have been if the petition had not been presented. This could lead to the voiding of winding up orders made in respect of such petitions. Similarly, no winding up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis of an inability to pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that the COVID 19 pandemic had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the inability to pay debts would have existed even if the COVID 19 pandemic had not had a financial effect on the company. Any winding up orders made during this period but before the Act came into force will be void and the court can give directions to the insolvency official to restore the company to its “pre-petition” position. _(f) Statutory demands_ Under the Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) (No. 2) Regulations 2021), as from April 27, 2020 the presentation of a winding up petition will not be permitted on the basis of a statutory demand served during the period between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021 (subject to extension). This applies whether or not the COVID 19 pandemic had an impact on the company’s failure to discharge the demand. _(g) So-called “Henry VIII” powers_ The Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Change of Expiry Date) Regulations 2021) further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations until April 29, 2022. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person’s corporate duties and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. ----- Where an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount proved between the date on which such English obligor goes into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled.

Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole.

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of H.I.J. Limited insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: “désastre” and winding up (including just and equitable winding up and creditors’ winding up). The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey (the “Royal Court”) under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en _désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of “désastre,” title and possession of the property of the debtor_ ----- vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt. Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding up of an insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the winding up, no action can be taken or continued against the company except with the leave of the Royal Court. The shareholders must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence the creditors’ winding-up. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the secured party has no other remedy against the company without leave of the Royal Court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding up if (among other things) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate. Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of the declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract. A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the company/ debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/ Viscount from all liability in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal Court think fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. ----- In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. The Royal Court’s position may also not be in accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the EU for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the Recast Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of center of main interests does not apply. Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preferences, extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey. Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law. The Jersey situs assets of H.I.J. Limited will be secured pursuant to Jersey law governed security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take certain ancillary actions, including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement, to the extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest unless, in each case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give certain persons, any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order of the court on application by a person entitled to the surplus. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client (as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II) or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in the Prospectus Regulation); - it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the UK. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA) or (iii) not a qualified investor (as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation); and - it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK. The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Issuer and Guarantors have also agreed that neither they, nor any of their affiliates or any other person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchaser), will (i) solicit offers for, or offer or sell, the Notes by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Regulation D or in any manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the ----- U.S. Securities Act or (ii) engage in any directed selling efforts within the meaning of Regulation S, and all such persons will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S. Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes _and the Guarantees—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ The Initial Purchasers may engage in over allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In connection with the Offering, a stabilizing manager, or person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, a stabilizing manager, or person acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. A stabilizing manager may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, a stabilizing manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. A stabilizing manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile, Our Structure, the Notes and the Guarantees—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking (including hedging) and/ or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Each of Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc and Banco Santander, S.A., or their respective affiliates are mandated lead arrangers, original lenders and/or bookrunners under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. HSBC Bank plc is the agent and HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited is the security agent under these agreements. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates (including the ----- Notes). The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy; - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognized); - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983); - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. With respect to the Strategic eport and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below. _Strategic Report and irectors’ report_ In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report for the year ended 28 March 2021 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.19,Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit,145.19.1,,"_Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements_ As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. _Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_ Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. ----- Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the financial reporting requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and tax regulatory compliance in the UK and other jurisdictions, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to a potential breach of the financial reporting requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and non-compliance with regulation or laws relating to tax. Audit procedures performed included: - Financial statement review procedures against Companies Act 2006 requirements; and - Audit of corporation tax and VAT including tax disclosures within the financial statements and uncertain tax positions There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. _Use of this report_ This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. Vehicle auction revenue represents vendor and buyer fees for vehicles sold by the Group together with fees for related services including transportation, inspection, valeting and mechanical checks. Revenue is recognised at the time the service is provided, which is predominantly at the point the vehicle is sold at auction. Revenue represents the fees for the auction service not the value of the vehicle sold, as the Group does not control the vehicle before being transferred from vendor to buyer, and does not incur the significant risks and rewards of ownership as part of the transaction. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The subsequent resale vehicle proceeds are recognised in full as takeover revenue on the date of resale. Revenue from outsourced remarketing contracts, where the Group obtains control and takes legal title to certain vehicles based on contractual agreements, represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Where the Group does not obtain control, revenue represents the fees for the outsourced remarketing services provided and not the value of the vehicle sold. Interest and loan origination fees earned in respect of the provision of Partner Finance loans are recognised over the term of the funding and are included within revenue. Fees charged by Partner Finance are recognised evenly over the period that the relevant service is provided. Vehicle buying revenue represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Transaction fees charged to customers are recognised on the purchase invoice date and treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory and therefore in the cost of sales. Revenue for other services, including logistics and automotive services, is recognised once the contracted service has been provided. For transportation or delivery services this is deemed to be when the customer has received the vehicle; for storage services this is deemed to be once an activity has been completed, such as receiving and parking a vehicle, and generally on a daily basis for storage charges; for vehicle repair and vehicle enhancement work this is deemed to be when work has been completed to a stage that can be invoiced to the customer; and for fleet services management this is deemed to be over the period the service is provided on a straight line basis. _Loans and receivables_ Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that arise principally through the provision of services to customers. These loans and receivables do not contain a significant financing component and are initially recognised at the transaction price. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. _Impairment of financial assets_ Impairment provisions are recognised under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the receivable. The expected credit loss model is calculated using the simplified approach as there is no significant financing component. This approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised based on an expected default rate. For trade receivables, which are reported net of any provisions, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within operating costs in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision. impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows (‘cash generating units’), which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. _Assets under construction_ The costs of assets that are being constructed are capitalised as described in the Owned assets paragraph above. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is deemed to be available for use. For the asset to be available for use it has to be in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Once the asset is available for use it is no longer classified as an asset under construction and is instead depreciated like any other item of property, plant and equipment. _Depreciation_ Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The rates of depreciation are as follows: Land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2–10 years Plant, machinery and motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . 3–25 years Assets acquired through business combinations are depreciated over the remaining useful life at acquisition. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. For the Group’s impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets. Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. The costs are included in the related right of use asset, unless those costs relate to assets which are accounted for as short term assets. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. The Group has elected to not apply IFRS 16 to leases of intangibles. _The Group as a lessor_ The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its properties. These are classified as operating leases unless the terms of the lease substantially transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Changes to the retirement benefit obligation or asset due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, presented as remeasurements of the defined benefit scheme in full in the period in which they arise. Where scheme assets exceed the defined benefit obligation the net asset is only recognised to the extent that an economic benefit is available to the Group in accordance with the terms of the scheme and where consistent with relevant statutory requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to taxes payable in respect of prior periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely outcome method, in line with the interpretation issued in IFRIC 23. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of other assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are unlikely to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner and timing of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

These are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment loss. Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 are met. Costs incurred before this point are expensed as incurred and are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. The assessment identifies unique software products that are controlled by the Group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year.

The Group recognises a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position and is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset) whenever: - the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. - the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used). - the lease payments substantially change or other rent concessions are agreed with the lessor during the lease term. - a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs.

Vehicle auction revenue represents vendor and buyer fees for vehicles sold by the Group together with fees for related services including transportation, inspection, valeting and mechanical checks. Revenue is recognised at the time the service is provided, which is predominantly at the point the vehicle is sold at auction. Revenue represents the fees for the auction service not the value of the vehicle sold, as the Group does not control the vehicle before being transferred from vendor to buyer, and does not incur the significant risks and rewards of ownership as part of the transaction. In the ordinary course of business at vehicle auctions, in certain circumstances BCA will purchase a vehicle from a vendor in order to honour a sale where, for example, a buyer has reneged on the purchase or there was an error in the sales process. The subsequent resale vehicle proceeds are recognised in full as takeover revenue on the date of resale. Revenue from outsourced remarketing and other contracts where the Group obtains control and takes legal title to certain vehicles based on contractual agreements, represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Where the Group does not obtain control, revenue represents the fees for the outsourced remarketing services provided and not the value of the vehicle sold. Interest and loan origination fees earned in respect of the provision of Partner Finance loans are recognised over the term of the funding and are included within revenue. ees charged by Partner Finance are recognised evenly over the period that the relevant service is provided. Vehicle buying revenue represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Transaction fees charged to customers are recognised on the purchase invoice date and treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory and therefore in the cost of sales. Revenue for other services, including logistics and automotive services, is recognised once the contracted service has been provided. For transportation or delivery services this is deemed to be when the customer has received the vehicle; for storage services this is deemed to be once an activity has been completed, such as receiving and parking a vehicle, and generally on a daily basis for storage charges; for vehicle repair and vehicle enhancement work this is deemed to be when work has been completed to a stage that can be invoiced to the customer; and for fleet services management this is deemed to be over the period the service is provided on a straight line basis. in bringing each product to its present location and condition. In the Vehicle Buying division the vehicle cost is net of any administration fees paid to the Group by the seller of the vehicle. Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred on completion of the sale and disposal. non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. the asset to its working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and when the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement. _Assets under construction_ The costs of assets that are being constructed are capitalised as described in the Owned assets paragraph above. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is deemed to be available for use. For the asset to be available for use it has to be in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Once the asset is available for use it is no longer classified as an asset under construction and is instead depreciated like any other item of property, plant and equipment. _Depreciation_ Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The rates of depreciation are as follows: Land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 years or the unexpired lease term if shorter Fixtures, fittings and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 – 10 years Plant, machinery and motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 25 years Assets acquired through business combinations are depreciated over the remaining useful life at acquisition. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. For the Group’s impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets. - the lease payments substantially change or other rent concessions are agreed with the lessor during the lease term. - a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The Group elects not to remeasure the lease liability when a significant change or rent concession has occurred as a direct consequence of the covid-19 pandemic, provided: the revised consideration is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration immediately preceding the change, any reduction in lease payments only affects payments originally due on or before 30 June 2022; and there is no other substantive change to the lease terms. The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. The costs are included in the related right of use asset, unless those costs relate to assets which are accounted for as short term assets. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. The Group has elected to not apply IFRS 16 to leases of intangibles. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.

Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to taxes payable in respect of prior periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely outcome method, in line with the interpretation issued in IFRIC 23. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of other assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are unlikely to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner and timing of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

These loans and receivables do not contain a significant financing component and are initially recognised at the transaction price. hey are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. _Impairment of financial assets_ Impairment provisions are recognised under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the receivable. The expected credit loss model is calculated using the simplified approach as there is no significant financing component. This approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised based on an expected default rate. For trade receivables, which are reported net of any provisions, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within operating costs in the income statement.

The SONR items that are excluded from EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA are as follows: - Income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business closure costs, restructuring costs and share based payment related charges; - Impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill; - Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition; - Acquisition expenses and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership. The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and are not reflective of underlying business performance. Share based payment related charges are excluded as the initial implementation and ongoing costs are significant or non-recurring and are not reflective of underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence may not be directly comparable. All non-GAAP measures are reconciled back to statutory equivalents. They are provided with the clear intention to aid understanding of performance. Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions. Management has identified that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The Board of Directors consider the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. Group Costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments. Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is therefore not disclosed. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

On 3 March 2021 it was announced that the UK’s main rate of corporation tax is due to increase from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023. The increase in the rate was not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and therefore is not reflected in the tax charge for the year. The future increase in the tax rate would result in an additional deferred tax charge of approximately £39.0m in the year of enactment. The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. Where points are investigated, the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds a provision in respect of the potential tax liability which may arise. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely outcome method, in line with the interpretation issued in IFRIC 23. There are no provisions that are individually or collectively material.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are considered as not impaired. Cash flow forecasts use the budget, future Strategic plan forecasts and future growth rates. These form the basis of the cash flow projections for each CGU, and are the basis for the remaining forecast financial years. The forecast reflects management’s expectations of the medium term operating performance of each CGU and growth prospects in the CGU’s markets and regions, and are based on the Strategic plan.

The discount rate is estimated by the Group using a range of equity costs for similar companies and external market data, with samples chosen where applicable from the same markets or territories as the CGU. The assumptions applied in the calculation of value in use for goodwill have been sensitised as follows: - 10% reduction to long term operating cash flow - 0.25% increase in discount rate The Directors have reviewed the key assumptions used in the impairment calculations and have considered the impact of reasonably possible changes in these assumptions, including those sensitivities identified above. Based on this review, the Directors have identified that these reasonably likely changes could give rise to a material change to the recoverable amount of the assets, but would not give rise to an impairment. _Software impairment_ During the year, the Group recognised an impairment charge in operating costs of £0.7m. This was recognised in full in Vehicle Remarketing UK. The cash generating unit is a reportable segment as defined in IFRS 8. The impairment charge represents the total carrying value for a specific piece of software for which the Group no longer expects to receive any future benefit. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The term loan was drawn down in full and £90m of the revolving facility was initially drawn down, net of transaction costs of £2.9m, and used to repay the previous debt facility held within the Group. During the year the Group extended the facility for a further 12 months to 6 February 2022, with no repayment of the term loan due before that time. The extension has been accounted for as a modification of the existing multi-currency facility. Carrying amounts are stated net of unamortised transaction costs. The transaction costs, together with the interest expense, are being allocated to the income statement over the term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying amount. The fair value of bank borrowings is equal to the nominal value of the bank loan as the impact of discounting is not significant. The fair value of gross bank borrowings is £348.0m (2018: £328.9m) which is equal to the nominal value. The effective interest rate including the impact of non-utilisation fees on the revolving facility and the utilisation fees for the letters of credit drawn down from the revolving facility, as well as the amortisation of debt issue costs is 2.4% (2018: 2.3%). The Group’s principal bank loans at 31 March 2019 were denominated in Sterling £296.3m (2018: £276.3m) and Euros €60.0m (2018: €60.0m), and bear variable interest based on LIBOR and EURIBOR respectively. They were secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Group’s present and future assets. At 31 March 2019, the Group had issued letters of credit in the ordinary course of business of £4.3m (2018: £4.4m) and had drawn down £90.0m (2018: £70.0m) of the revolving facility, leaving the following as undrawn borrowing facilities:",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The Group’s share based payments were valued at inception by independent valuation experts. The share based incentives were assumed to be equity-settled and have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. The value of the services received in exchange for the share based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of the incentives at their grant date. The fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Group. At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest due to non-market conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders’ equity. At the year end, there were no outstanding share based incentives. During the year, no charge has been recognised in the consolidated income statement as a charge in relation to the share based incentives (year ended 1 April 2018: £2.0m). 2,245,554 treasury shares were issued in April 2018 in respect of the Performance based scheme.

The plan is closed to new members. The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out as of 5 April 2017 and updated to the year end date by Capita, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance with IAS 19. The Automotive Plan provides benefits based on final pensionable salary. The plan closed to future accrual from 1997. The valuation used for these accounts is based on the results of an actuarial valuation carried out as of 5 April 2016 and updated to the year end date by JLT, independent consulting actuaries, in accordance with IAS 19. The defined benefit plans are registered with HMRC and comply fully with the regulatory framework published by the UK pensions regulator. Benefits are paid to the members from a separate fund administered by independent trustees. The BCA Pension Plan has five trustees, three of whom are appointed by the Group and two chosen by scheme members. The Automotive Plan has four trustees, two of whom are appointed by the Group and two chosen by scheme members. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the members and are responsible for making funding and investment decisions in conjunction with the Group. On 26 October 2018 the English High Court ruling in Lloyds Banking Group Pension Trustees Limited v Lloyds Bank plc and others held that UK pension schemes with Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs) accrued from 17 May 1990 must equalise for the difference in GMPs between men and women. Consequently the Group incurred a non-recurring pension cost of £2.2m in the year reflecting the initial estimate of applying the ruling. Changes in the fair value of the defined benefit asset in the Automotive pension plan are as follows: Asset volatility. . . . . . . ._ Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the plan assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisers, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. Currently the plans hold approximately 40% of assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) with the intention of mitigating significant changes in yields. As each plan matures, the level of investment risk is reduced by investing more in government and corporate bonds that better match the liabilities. However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long-term investment strategy. In respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’) obligations, the strategy has the objectives of achieving an overall rate of return that is sufficient to meet pensioners’ reasonable expectations, reduce investment return volatility over the short-term period to retirement where this is possible and to invest in assets that are liquid such that they enable switching between asset classes. In order to achieve these objectives, the strategy is to invest in a mixture of on-risk assets (including equities) and off-risk assets (including bonds, gilts and cash), with the proportionate allocation of the latter increasing according to an agreed profile as members approach their normal retirement date. Inflation . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’pension liabilities in deferment are linked to inflation. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation. The BCA Pension Plan holds approximately 5% of the plans’ assets in index-linked bonds to partially hedge against this risk. The remainder of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, and so an increase in inflation can lead to an increase in the plan deficit. Mortality . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’ obligation is to provide a pension for the life of their members, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ benefit payments. Whilst future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty the plans adopt up to date mortality assumptions and review the overall risk as part of the triennial actuarial valuations. Bond yields . . . . . . . . . ._ Plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans. This risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields. An increase in interest rates has the effect of increasing bond yields, which in turn decreases plan liabilities. If interest rates decrease the opposite is true for both plan liabilities and assets. Salary changes . . . . . . ._ The calculation of the BCA Pension Plan liabilities uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants. Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the plan liabilities. The Automotive Plan is closed to future accruals, so is not exposed to this risk.

These assumptions may be different to the actual outcome. The potential impact of equalisation on each scheme has been estimated, taking into account the proportion of liabilities affected, the proportion of males and females and the potential cost of equalisation for members. The impact on the BCA Automotive Plan is relatively large because of the high proportion of benefit obligations that are affected and the high proportion of males in the scheme.

The investment policies of each scheme are described below: Asset volatility. . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the plan assets under perform this yield, then this will create a deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisers, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. Currently the plans hold approximately 35% of assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) with the intention of mitigating significant changes in yields. As each plan matures, the level of investment risk is reduced by investing more in governmentand corporate bonds that better match the liabilities. However, the Group believes that due tothe long term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is anappropriate element of the long term investment strategy. In respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’) obligations, the strategy has the objectivesof achieving an overall rate of return that is sufficient to meet pensioners’ reason able expectations, reduce investment return volatility over the short term period to retirement where this is possible and to invest in assets that are liquid such that they enable switching between asset classes. In order to achieve these objectives, the strategy is to invest in a mixture of on-risk assets (including equities) and off-risk assets (including bonds, gilts and cash), with the proportionate allocation of the latter increasing according to an agreed profile as members approach their normal retirement date. Inflation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’ pension liabilities in deferment are linked to inflation. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation. The BCA Pension Plan holds approximately 5% of the plans’ assets in index-linked bonds (including government bonds) to partially hedge against this risk. The remainder of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, and so an increase in inflation can lead to an increase in the plan deficit. Mortality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The plans’obligation is to provide a pension for the life of their members, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ benefit payments. Whilst future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty the plans adopt up to date mortality assumptions and review the overall risk as part of the triennial actuarial valuations. Bond yields . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ Plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans. This risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields. An increase in interest rates has the effect of increasing bond yields, which in turn decreases plan liabilities. If interest rates decrease the opposite is true for both plan liabilities and assets. Salary changes . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ The calculation of the BCA Pension Plan liabilities uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants. Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the plan liabilities. The Automotive Plan is closed to future accruals, so is not exposed to this risk. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we ----- identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below. _Strategic Report and Directors’ report_ In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report for the period ended 29 March 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ report.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. _Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_ Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. _Use of this report_ This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and are not reflective of underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence may not be directly comparable. All non-GAAP measures are reconciled back to statutory equivalents. They are provided with the clear intention to aid understanding of performance.

Management has identified that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

The effective tax rate has therefore been referenced to the UK corporation tax rate of 19.0% for the period. _Effective tax rate_ The effective tax rate for the period of (4.7%) is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK principally as a result of the following differences: - Permanently disallowable expenditure incurred in relation to the acquisition of BCA Marketplace plc in the period and on the impairment of goodwill on consolidation; - The revaluation of deferred tax liabilities in respect of acquired intangibles arising from the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 17.0% to 19.0% from April 2020; and - Non-deductible foreign exchange losses arising on the Group’s external Euro borrowings. Excluding the impact of significant or non-recurring items in the period and the revaluation of deferred tax balances, the Group has an underlying tax rate of 199.4%. Excluding the impact of the hedged foreign exchange movements results in an adjusted underlying effective tax rate of 21.4%. The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. Where points are investigated, the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds a provision in respect of the potential tax liability which may arise. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that the Group operates, and are measured as appropriate on an expected value or most likely outcome method, in line with the interpretation issued in IFRIC 23.

The total outstanding BCAM share capital was acquired by BBD Bidco Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, for cash consideration of £2.3635 per share. The acquisition was completed through a Court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006. Following the acquisition, BCAM reregistered from a public company to a private limited company. This has resulted in the acquisition of a number of identified intangible assets including existing brands and customer relationships and goodwill arising due to the unique position that BCAM has in the automotive sector, including the value of the geographical presence and assembled workforce in place, significant barriers to entry for competitors, and access to significant automotive market data and knowledge.

The discount rate is estimated by the Group using a range of equity costs for similar companies and external market data, with samples chosen where applicable from the same markets or territories as the CGU. The calculation of value in use for goodwill is sensitive to the following key assumptions: - Operating cash flow - Discount rate _Covid-19 related goodwill impairment_ During the period, the Group recognised an impairment charge in operating costs of £266.4m. This was spilt across two cash generating units: Vehicle Remarketing UK (£154.6m) and Vehicle Buying (£111.8m). These cash generating units are reportable segments as defined in IFRS 8. In March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of covid-19 a global pandemic and the governments of many of our markets entered into social distancing lockdown arrangements, which significantly impacted the Group’s ability to operate as usual. The impairment charge represents a change in the timing of vehicle volumes expected to flow through the marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. The Group has tested goodwill in reference to its value in use, which is based on forecasts of the Group in its current condition and therefore does not include inflows expected from improving or enhancing the performance of its assets that was expected to arise following the acquisition, to which the Group is not yet committed. The used vehicle marketplace, particularly auctions, is historically resilient in periods of economic turbulence. Management does not consider the markets in which the Group operates to be significantly impacted in the long run by the outbreak of covid-19. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS (continued) Risk management,1765.10.1,,"These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as mortality risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk. The investment policies of each scheme are described below: Asset volatility . . . ._ Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the plan assets underperform this yield, then this will create a deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisers, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. Currently the plans hold approximately 40% of assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) with the intention of mitigating significant changes in yields. As each plan matures, the level of investment risk is reduced by investing more in government and corporate bonds that better match the liabilities. However, the Group believes that due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the long term investment strategy. In respect of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (‘GMP’) obligations, the strategy has the objectives of achieving an overall rate of return that is sufficient to meet pensioners’ reasonable expectations, reduce investment return volatility over the short term period to retirement where this is possible and to invest in assets that are liquid such that they enable switching between asset classes. In order to achieve these objectives, the strategy is to invest in a mixture of on-risk assets (including equities) and off-risk assets (including bonds, gilts and cash), with the proportionate allocation of the latter increasing according to an agreed profile as members approach their normal retirement date. Inflation . . . . . . . ._ The plans’ pension liabilities in deferment are linked to inflation. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in the majority of cases there are caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation. The BCA Pension Plan holds approximately 6% of the plans’ assets in index-linked bonds (including government bonds) to partially hedge against this risk. The remainder of the plans’ assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, and so an increase in inflation can lead to an increase in the plan deficit. Mortality . . . . . . ._ The plans’ obligation is to provide a pension for the life of their members, so realised increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ benefit payments. Whilst future mortality rates cannot be predicted with certainty the plans adopt up to date mortality assumptions and review the overall risk as part of the triennial actuarial valuations. Bond yields . . . . . ._ Plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans. This risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields. An increase in interest rates has the effect of increasing bond yields, which in turn decreases plan liabilities. If interest rates decrease the opposite is true for both plan liabilities and assets. Salary changes_ . . . . The calculation of the BCA Pension Plan liabilities uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants. Increases in the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the plan liabilities. The Automotive Plan is closed to future accruals, so is not exposed to this risk.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

LIST OF GROUP UNDERTAKINGS,1768.31,"Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud",1768.31.1,,"Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to, but were not limited to, the Listing Rules, pensions legislation and UK and European tax legislation, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to manipulating financial performance to achieve targeted results through posting inappropriate journal entries, management bias in accounting estimates or judgement in selecting accounting policies. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included: - Discussions with management, internal audit and the Group’s legal advisors, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud; - Evaluation of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities, in particular their antibribery controls; - Assessment of matters reported on the group’s whistleblowing helpline and the results of management’s investigation of such matters; - Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to impairment of intangible fixed assets (see related key audit matter below); - Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations or posted by senior management There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

As a result of the acquisitions made over the past We performed a detailed review of management’s 4 years, significant goodwill of £950.1m and acquired year end impairment assessment and ensured the intangibles comprising £498.9m of brand and calculations were mathematically accurate. In customer relationships, and £8.4m of software fair performing this review we have agreed the underlying value uplift have been recognised on the balance data on which the assessment is based to other sheet. There is a risk that these assets are no longer audited information or to approved budgets or deemed to be recoverable and hence should be forecasts. impaired. Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, all Cash Generating Units (‘CGUs’) containing goodwill must be tested for impairment annually. To fulfil this requirement, management perform an impairment review on an annual basis for each of its CGUs, along with additional impairment reviews whenever an indication of impairment exists. The impairment reviews performed by management contain a number of significant judgements and estimates including revenue growth rates and discount rates. A change in these assumptions can result in a material change in the valuation of the assets, and as a result there is a risk that goodwill is no longer deemed to be recoverable and hence should be impaired. As a result, assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a significant risk due to the quantum of the balance and the level of estimation involved. _Partner Finance debtors may not be recoverable Refer to page 124 (note 15) for management’s disclosure_ At 31 March 2019, £171.8m of trade receivables were due from customers under Partner Finance arrangements. We have assessed the reasonableness of growth assumptions used in management’s forecasts by comparing them to historical performance. We considered all assumptions used by management to be reasonable. We performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment assessment to understand the extremity of assumptions required in order to “break the model”. We did not identify any CGUs requiring an impairment. We have also assessed the adequacy of disclosures made and assessed compliance with IAS 36. For a sample of significant debtors we have tested the outstanding customer balance at the year end to subsequent cash receipt to prove the recoverability of the year end balance, with no issues noted. In addition we have tested a sample of the remaining population of subsequent receipts to cash and performed the following procedures over the remaining balance. We reviewed the quantum of aged debt and tested the aging of the debtor report on which management’s provision is based. We also reviewed debtor balances due from customers considered to be at higher risk of ----- irrecoverability and note that all balances had either been provided against or recovered since year end.

We have reviewed a sample of significant projects developed during the year through review of budgets, expected use and distinguishable product.

BCA Marketplace delivers a comprehensive range of linked services in the automotive industry. The Group owns and operates the UK’s and Europe’s largest used vehicle exchange and is the UK’s leading provider of vehicle buying services. The Group operates from a number of distinct legal entities across the UK and Europe which are split across four main divisions generating revenue being UK Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. These represent the Group’s operating segments together with Group costs. Central Group services and financial reporting procedures are performed by the UK HQ. Our scoping considerations for the Group audit were based both on financial information and risk. British Car Auctions Limited and We Buy Any Car Limited represent the majority of the trading results for the ----- Group and are individually financially significant based upon the adjusted profit before tax they contribute to the overall trading results. As a result we performed an audit of the complete financial information of both entities providing coverage of 74% of the Group’s adjusted profit before tax. In addition we performed an audit of the complete financial information of BCA Central Limited, BCA Vehicle Finance Limited and BCA Outsource Solutions Limited as a result of the number of individually significant financial statement line items within each of these entities. To provide further coverage on an individual financial statement line item level, we also performed specific audit procedures over property, plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents for Walon Limited and trade receivables for BCA Fleet Solutions Limited and Paragon Fleet Solutions Limited, both within the Automotive Services segment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

How we determined it** 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles and significant or non-recurring items. Rationale for benchmark applied** Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report, profit before tax is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark. Profit before tax has been adjusted for items which are not representative of the underlying results of the business and which are therefore adjusted in the reconciliation presented below the income statement. 5% of loss before tax adjusted for significant or non-recurring items and intercompany recharges. We believe that loss before tax is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the entity, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark. For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £313,000 and £6,270,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £ 330,000 (Group audit) (2018: £300,000) and £15,700 (Company audit) (2018: £20,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

This occurs where, for example, a buyer has reneged on the purchase or there was an error in the sales process. This typically represents between 1% and 2% of remarketing volume. Applying the five step process prescribed by IFRS 15, the resale will be recognised in revenue, not cost of sales. This is due to there being a deemed contract between BCA and the buyer, with a clear performance obligation and a determined transaction price. This is considered a cost of business and the purchase and subsequent resale have historically been netted down within cost of sales. Consequently, the effect of the adoption of the new accounting policy is to increase both revenue and cost of sales with no net impact on gross margin. _Faster payment adjustment_ The UK Vehicle Buying division offers a faster payment service at additional cost to the vehicle seller. Historically this fee has been netted down against the purchase price of the vehicle within cost of sales. Under IFRS 15 this fee is now recognised within revenue, as there is an identifiable service and therefore performance obligation within the vehicle purchase contract. Consequently, the effect of the adoption of the new accounting policy is to increase both revenue and cost of sales with no net impact on gross margin.

Following initial recognition, the carrying amounts will be increased for the effective interest and reduced by the payments made. This will result in a material change to the balance sheet. The measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities will involve judgement particularly in relation to the lease term, as well as in relation to the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future payments. The Group currently recognises obligations under both operating leases and finance leases which will be derecognised on transition to IFRS 16. - Income statement—Operating lease costs are currently charged to operating costs. Under IFRS 16 the right of use assets will be depreciated and the effective interest on the lease liabilities will be charged to finance costs. Following adoption, IFRS 16 will have a favourable impact on adjusted EBITDA due to depreciation and finance costs being excluded from this key performance indicator, but is expected to have an unfavourable impact on profit before tax. This is expected to reduce by £4m to £6m following adoption. - Cash flow statement—Under IFRS 16, the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities will be reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the interest portion will be included in cash flows from operating activities. At present the full operating lease payment is reflected in cash flows from operating activities. Whilst there is no impact on net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, it will increase cash flows from operating activities and decrease cash flows from financing activities. - Out of scope leases—Leases under $5,000 (or equivalent) or 12 months in length will not be accounted for as described above and will continue to be treated as operating leases, with the cost in operating costs in the income statement and future payments not reflected on the balance sheet. The total cost in the income statement will continue to be disclosed in the operating costs disclosure note. The Group has introduced a new lease accounting software solution to assist in the ongoing management and accounting of leases under IFRS 16. This tool has been subject to various testing and benchmarking processes to ensure that it is suitable to meet the current and future needs of the business. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and has not adopted early. On adoption, the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 will be recognised in equity. Management have elected to take several practical expedients on transition. IFRS 16 will result in expanded disclosures due to the requirements of the standard and the material nature of the Group lease portfolio. Further details including the adjustments recognised on transition will be disclosed in the Interim Results Report 2019. _IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments_ For the period starting 1 April 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments will become effective which clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement of income taxes under IAS 12. The interpretation establishes methodology to be used in assessing the appropriate level of provision where there is uncertainty over the income tax treatment. Different methods of calculation are expected to be used in different circumstances, taking into account the nature of the uncertainty and whether the outcome is expected to be within a range or whether a binary outcome is expected. The Group are currently assessing the effect of the interpretation and in particular how the measurement of uncertainty under the Expected Value method will impact the positions. The Group expect to apply the interpretation using the modified retrospective approach, and will recognise any change in the cumulative provision on adoption as an adjustment to opening equity. The Group do not expect the impact of adopting the interpretation to be material. Further details will be disclosed in the Interim Results Report 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,49,IFRIC 23,49.3,FINANCIALS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued) 4.** **Accounting policies (continued),49.3.1,,"Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. Vehicle auction revenue represents vendor and buyer fees for vehicles sold by the Group together with fees for related services including transportation, inspection, valeting and mechanical checks. Revenue is recognised at the time the service is provided, which is predominantly at the point the vehicle is sold at auction. Revenue represents the fees for the auction service not the value of the vehicle sold, as the Group does not incur the significant risks and rewards of ownership as part of the transaction. In the ordinary course of business at vehicle auctions, in certain circumstances BCA will purchase a vehicle from a vendor in order to honour a sale where, for example, a buyer has reneged on the purchase or there was an error in the sales process. The subsequent resale vehicle proceeds are recognised in full as takeover revenue on the date of resale. Revenue from outsourced remarketing contracts, where the Group takes legal title of certain vehicles based on contractual agreements, represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Interest and loan origination fees earned in respect of the provision of Partner Finance loans are recognised over the term of the funding and are included within revenue. Fees charged by Partner Finance are recognised evenly over the period that the relevant service is provided. Vehicle buying revenue represents the vehicle sale proceeds obtained when the vehicle is sold and is recognised on the date of sale. Transaction fees charged to vendors of vehicles are recognised on the purchase invoice date and treated as a reduction in the cost of inventory and therefore recognised within the cost of sales. Revenue for other services, including logistics and automotive services, is recognised once the contracted service has been provided. For transportation or delivery services this is deemed to be when the customer has received the vehicle; for storage services this is deemed to be once an activity has been completed, such as receiving and parking a vehicle, and generally on a daily basis for storage charges; for vehicle repair and vehicle enhancement work this is deemed to be when work has been completed to a stage that can be invoiced to the customer; and for fleet services management this is deemed to be over the period the service is provided on a straight line basis. expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in finance costs. _Property leases and dilapidations_ Provisions for onerous leases on property are recognised when it is probable that future obligations under the lease will exceed earnings achievable from the property, taking into account the Directors’ estimation of likely income from the subletting of vacant property. The amounts of such net outflows are discounted at the risk-appropriate rate, and are stated net of any anticipated sublease income. Provisions for dilapidations are made in respect of property leases on a lease by lease basis and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. Where relevant, these estimated outflows are discounted to net present value. Other assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows (‘cash generating units’), which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Assets acquired through business combinations are depreciated over the remaining useful life at acquisition. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. For the Group’s impairment policy on non-financial assets see (m) Impairment of non-financial assets. _Share based payment transactions_ The Group operates equity-settled, share based plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the awards is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the compensation as determined by independent valuations. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest. The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period during which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees are expected to become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). At each reporting date, the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions reflects, in the opinion of the Directors, the number of awards that will vest and the proportion of the period to vesting that has expired. Directors’ estimates are based on the best available information at that date. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting, irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of other assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are unlikely to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. _Impairment of financial assets_ Impairment provisions are recognised under the expected credit loss model on initial recognition of the receivable. The expected credit loss model is calculated using the simplified approach as there is no significant financing component. This approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised based on an expected default rate. For trade receivables, which are reported net of any provisions, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within operating costs in the income statement.

Costs relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once all the development phase recognition criteria of IAS 38 are met. Costs incurred before this point are expensed as incurred and are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. The assessment identifies unique software products that are controlled by the Group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year. Salary and related employment costs that are directly attributable to the development of the software are then capitalised. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised in equal annual amounts over the estimated useful life of the software. Amortisation and impairment are charged to operating costs in the period in which they arise. Amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis from the date on which the assets are brought into use, with useful lives as indicated below: Customer relationships. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 – 20 years Brand. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 – 25 years Software–Internally generated. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 10 years Software–Acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 7 years, or the licence term if shorter Assets acquired through business combinations are amortised over the remaining useful life at acquisition.

Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units, which are no higher than an operating segment prior to aggregation, and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,49,IFRIC 23,49.18,"(n) Property, plant and equipment",49.18.1,,"_Owned assets_ Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and when the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement. _Assets under construction_ The costs of assets that are being constructed are capitalised as described in the Owned assets paragraph above. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is deemed to be available for use. For the asset to be available for use it has to be in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Once the asset is available for use it is no longer classified as an asset under construction and is instead depreciated like any other item of property, plant and equipment. _Leased assets_ Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as finance leases. Property, plant and equipment acquired under a finance lease is recorded at fair value or, if lower, the present value of minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less depreciation and any impairment. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in the other short-term or long-term payables as appropriate. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term, on a straight line basis. _Depreciation_ Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Any property, plant and equipment acquired under a finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The rates of depreciation are as follows: Land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 years, or the unexpired lease period if shorter Fixtures, fittings and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 – 10 years Plant, machinery and motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 25 years -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the expected utilisation of the facility to which it relates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds. Where the Group purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,49,IFRIC 23,49.22,(q) Employee benefits,49.22.1,,"_Pension obligations_ The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. The defined benefit plans operated by the Group in the United Kingdom are closed to new members. The costs of providing benefits under the plans are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The current service cost is included in operating costs in the consolidated income statement. Past service costs are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Administrative scheme expenses associated with the plans are recorded within operating costs when incurred in line with IAS 19. Net interest income or interest cost relating to the funded defined benefit pension plans is included within finance income or finance costs as relevant in the consolidated income statement. Changes to the retirement benefit obligation or asset due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, presented as remeasurements of the defined benefit scheme in full in the period in which they arise. Where scheme assets exceed the defined benefit obligation the net asset is only recognised to the extent that an economic benefit is available to the Group in accordance with the terms of the scheme and where consistent with relevant statutory requirements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Accounting policies are reviewed annually for appropriateness. Estimates and judgements are evaluated continually and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, with any changes arising being recognised in the period in which the change in estimate is made or the final result determined. Certain of the Group’s significant accounting policies are considered by the Directors to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements. The principal critical accounting judgements in prior years related to determining the acquisition accounting in relation to the acquisition of the BCA group, and the identification of separable assets and liabilities arising on each acquisition. There were no unusual or significant transactions in the year that required critical judgement. Details of judgements can be found in note 18 on page 127.

A detailed narrative regarding Group and divisional performance has been provided in the Group operating review section on pages 29 to 35. The key performance indicators, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are presented and defined in notes 6 and 7. These are considered key performance indicators because management use these measures to assess long and short-term performance of the Group on a periodic basis.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,49,IFRIC 23,49.27,6.** **Segmental reporting Key Performance Indicator—adjusted EBITDA,49.27.1,,"Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is defined as Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) adjusted for significant or non-recurring items. The significant or non-recurring items that are excluded from EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA are as follows: - income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business closure costs, restructuring costs and onerous lease provisions; - impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill; - amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of the predecessor BCA Group and other businesses; and - acquisition expenses and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership. The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and are not reflective of underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence are not directly comparable. Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions. Management has identified that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The Board of Directors consider the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. Group Costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments. Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is therefore not disclosed. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The effective tax rate has therefore been referenced to the UK corporation tax rate of 19.0% for the year. _Effective tax rate_ The effective tax rate for the year of 23.4% (2018: 24.9%) is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK as a result of higher income tax rates in Europe, the impact of permanently disallowable items and provisions charged in the year, and the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in the UK and Europe. Permanently disallowable items comprise expenditure incurred which does not qualify for a tax deduction in the territory in which it arises and includes depreciation on assets not qualifying for tax deductions and current year movements on provisions for uncertain tax positions. Prior period adjustments relate primarily to the remeasurement of fixed assets qualifying for tax deductions which have been disposed of in prior periods. Excluding the impact of the significant or non-recurring items in the year, the Group has a tax rate of 22.5% (2018: 23.1%). This is in line with the 22.5% effective tax rate estimated in the Interim Results Report for the six months ended 30 September 2018. The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. Where points are investigated, the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds a provision in respect of the potential tax liability which may arise. There are no provisions that are individually or collectively material. For the period starting 1 April 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments will become effective, and further details can be found in note 3. Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19.0% (effective from 1 April 2017) and 17.0% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted prior to the balance sheet date. This will reduce the Group’s future tax charge accordingly. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reported at the balance sheet date have been measured using a blend of these rates, based on when the relevant tax liability or asset is expected to crystallise. Management expects the Group’s underlying tax rate to remain in the low-twenties in the short-term, before the anticipated impact of the future reduction in the corporation tax rate in the UK, France and the Netherlands reduces the overall tax rate from 2020 onwards. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are considered as not impaired. No impairment charges were incurred in the year ended 31 March 2019 (2018: £nil). Cash flow forecasts cover a period of five years following the year end. The first year of forecast is the Board approved budget. The budget forms the basis of the cash flow projections for each CGU which are used to forecast the next four financial years. The forecast reflects management’s expectations of the medium-term operating performance of each CGU and growth prospects in the CGU’s markets and regions, and are based on the Strategic plan as approved by the Board.

31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1772,"4.** **NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS",1772.1,Adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on 1 April 2019,1772.1.1,,"In the current period, the Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases. As anticipated, the lessee accounting requirements have had a significant impact on the Group’s financial position and performance. A number of the acquired Group’s properties, transporters and other operational equipment were previously accounted for as operating leases, but under IFRS 16 lease liabilities and right of use assets have been recognised instead. The key impacts are as follows: - Balance sheet—Under IAS 17 minimum lease payments under operating leases were disclosed in the notes to the accounts. Following IFRS 16 adoption the rights and obligations arising from all in-scope leases have been recognised as right of use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. This is consistent with the historic treatment of finance leases. The right of use assets were initially recognised at the present value of future lease payments plus initial direct costs and are subsequently depreciated over the lease term. The lease liabilities were initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made during the term of the lease. Following initial recognition, the carrying amounts have been increased for the effective interest and reduced by the payments made. The measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities involves judgement particularly in relation to the lease term, as well as in relation to the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future payments. - Income statement—Operating lease costs were charged under IAS 17 operating costs. Under IFRS 16, the right of use assets have been depreciated and the effective interest on the lease liabilities has been charged to finance costs. Following adoption, IFRS 16 has a favourable impact on adjusted EBITDA due to depreciation and finance costs being excluded from this key performance indicator, but has an unfavourable impact on profit before tax. - Cash flow statement—Under IFRS 16, the repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities has been reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the interest portion has been included in cash flows from operating activities. Previously the full operating lease payment was reflected in cash flows from ----- operating activities. Whilst there is no impact on net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, it has increased cash flows from operating activities and decreased cash flows from financing activities. - Out of scope leases—Leases under $5,000 (or equivalent) or 12 months in length have not been accounted for as described above and continue to be treated as operating leases, with the cost in operating costs in the income statement and future payments not reflected on the balance sheet. The total cost in the income statement will continue to be disclosed in the operating costs disclosure note. For Group leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases, the gross carrying amount of the respective asset and liability immediately before adoption has been determined as the appropriate carrying amount at adoption. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach. On adoption, the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 was recognised in equity. Management elected to take several practical expedients on transition: - Not to recognise right of use assets or lease liabilities for leases ending within 12 months from transition - As an alternative to performing an impairment test, adjust the asset on transition by the amount of any previously recognised onerous lease provision - Excluded initial direct costs in the measurement of the right of use asset",N/A,as_expected,2021,485

The transition method chosen by the Group results in a small reduction in opening retained earnings and lower corresponding right of use assets on specific high-value or long-term leased assets held by the Group, which results in lower future depreciation.

The Group has elected not to use a single discount rate for a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics, to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application, or to separate non-lease components from lease components. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date, the Group relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRC 4, ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’. Following the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, the Group’s accounting policies have been updated accordingly:",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1772,"4.** **NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS",1772.17,Leases,1772.17.1,,"_The Group as a lessee_ The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. The Group recognises a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straightline basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position and is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset) whenever: - the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. - the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the change in lease payments is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used). - the lease payments substantially change or other rent concessions are agreed with the lessor during the lease term. - a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. The costs are included in the related right of use asset, unless those costs relate to assets which are accounted for as short-term assets. ----- Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 16 to leases of intangibles. _The Group as a lessor_ The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its properties. These are classified as operating leases unless the terms of the lease substantially transfer all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
31_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1772,"4.** **NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS",1772.18,5.** **SEGMENTAL REPORTING Key Performance Indicator—adjusted EBITDA,1772.18.1,,"Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is defined as Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) adjusted for significant or non-recurring items (‘SONR’). The significant or non-recurring items that are excluded from EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA are as follows: - Income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business closure costs and restructuring costs; - Impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill; - Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition; - Acquisition expenses, and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership. The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Group’s activities, as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments. Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition are excluded because they reflect the nature of the acquisition accounting, and are not reflective of underlying business performance. As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence are not directly comparable. All non-GAAP measures are reconciled back to statutory equivalents. They are provided with the clear intention to aid understanding of performance. Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used both to assess performance and make strategic decisions. Management has identified that the Board of Directors is the chief operating decision maker in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The Board of Directors considers the business to be split into the four main revenue-generating divisions: UK Vehicle Remarketing, International Vehicle Remarketing, Vehicle Buying and Automotive Services. Group costs comprise central head office functions and any costs not directly attributable to the segments. Information on segment assets and liabilities is not regularly reported to the Board of Directors and is therefore not disclosed. ----- Segmental reporting has been prepared on a statutory basis, with the period from 1 April 2019 to 5 November 2019 presented under IFRS 16, and the comparative period from 2 April 2018 to 28 October 2018 prepared under IAS 17.",N/A,as_expected,2021,485
