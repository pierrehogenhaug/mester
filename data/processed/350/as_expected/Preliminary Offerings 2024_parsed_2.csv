In addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: - changes in global economic conditions and economic developments in the countries in which we operate; - the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the sanctions imposed by numerous countries and multinational entities in response as well as countermeasures by Russia and the adverse impacts on the global economy, global capital markets, supply chains, energy prices and supplies; - the cyclical nature of the industries and end-markets we serve; - changes in government spending and legislative actions and initiatives relating to renewable energy and electric power; - the ability to successfully implement ongoing and future improvement programs; - country risks in the regions we operate, including emerging markets; - dependance on certain large customers; - the ability to realize represented revenues by our Order Intake and Order Backlog; - our ability to compete effectively in our industry; - the ability to maintain the quality of our products and processes and to develop and manufacture new products in a timely manner in line with market trends and the pace of technological development; - increases in raw material prices, energy costs and prices for input materials and intermediate products, which may result in higher manufacturing or purchasing costs and lower margins and the ability to pass on such increased costs to our customers fully or at all; - supply or delivery chain disruptions; - dependance on third-parties for the delivery of raw materials as well as the distribution and delivery of our products, and disruptions or delays; - changes in our product mix or our portfolio of large projects; - delays and cost overruns in relation to our project business; - interruptions in our production and development processes, which may lead to production bottlenecks or production downtime, as well as accidents, safety defects, defective performance, quality defects or environmental incidents; ----- - potential default of contracting parties and credit risk; - dependency on financing being available to us, our customers and our suppliers; - failures or disruptions of our information technology; - dependency on the experience and talent of our senior management and the ability to recruit and retain key employees; - currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations; - our compliance with governmental regulations, laws and standards including environmental, health and safety protection; - climate change; - compliance with chemical regulations applicable to our products and raw materials; - ability to maintain the confidentiality of the personal data we handle in the ordinary course of business; - disruptions or higher costs due to labor disputes; - product liability claims and the ability to fulfill customer requirements or specifications; - warranty costs for defective systems and products and drawings under the performance guarantees granted in connections with our projects; - failure to comply with tax legislation, including VAT; - failure in achieving our sustainability-related goals; - potential liability for soil, surface water or groundwater contamination; - failure to protect our intellectual property and technical expertise; - other risks related to our capital structure and the Notes; and - other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive.

The Issuer urges you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the markets in which we operate.

As a result, we reduced trade working capital w/o retention from 12.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 1.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Over the same period, we managed to increase our Free Cash Flow Conversion rate from 57.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 61.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Over the last three years, we have set several measures to improve our operational efficiency (e.g. quality cost improvements from inward quality review and improvements in internal processes) and commercial efficiency. Our commercial efficiency focuses on the core areas (i) target selling (e.g. focus on vertical markets), (ii) process simplification (e.g. sales order review) and (iii) digitalization.

(a) Related to the closure of production facilities in Wingles, France, in December 2023. The adjustment mainly includes expenses of €8.4 million for severance, €1.5 million in consulting and legal costs in 2023. In December 2022, we recorded an inventory allowance of €3.1 million. (b) In the first quarter of 2022, KTS was carved out to a separate subgroup of legal entities in connection with a potential sale of KTS’ business. The adjustment relates to corresponding consulting, legal and stamp-duty costs (€5.4 million in 2021 and €3.2 million in 2022). As part of this strategic realignment, inventories and certain assets were impaired (€0.2 million in each of 2021 and 2022) and the decision was made to close the production for MCS and KTS in Pune, India, which led to severance costs. The adjustment also includes €0.2 million of personnel expenses in 2022 related to the transition period from the former CEO and current CEO. (c) Relates to severance payments for redundancies in our sales team in connection with key customer prioritization initiatives and the digitalization of order processing. (d) Relate to various measures and initiatives agreed in connection with the Group’s refinancing in 2019, including reorganization and downsizing of KTS in Spain, the exit of MCS production in India and capacity adjustments for KTS in France. (e) Relate to initiatives in MCS, RT and PHE in the United States, including changes to the product portfolio in MCS, a shift in product focus to dry coolers for data center and HVAC applications in RT as well as the relocation of PHE business operations to Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2022, the adjustment mainly relates to inventory write-offs (€7.4 million). (f) Relates primarily to the sale of the Dry Cooling Systems (DCS) business. DCS Heller was sold in December 2020, followed by the sale of the cooling tower service business in October 2021 and the sale of certain assets of the air-cooled condenser business (DCS-ACC) in March 2022. The remaining DCS-ACC business was wound down. In 2021, the adjustment relates to other operating income from the reversal of provisions related to the winding down of the DCS-ACC business (€17.7 million). In 2022, the adjustment includes €0.4 million for severance payments and €0.2 million for consulting costs related to the winding down of the DCS-ACC business. In January 2022, we divested the ENEXIO Water Business, and the associated consulting expenses and impairment of assets held for sale due to the lower than anticipated selling price (€1.6 million) were normalized in 2021. In 2022, the adjustment also includes a warranty provision of €1.4 million for a potential claim in Germany. (g) The adjustment comprises severance payments, impairment of inventories, consulting expenses and provision releases in relation to initiatives across various product groups and sales entities. (h) Relates to the litigation proceedings with former bondholders of the Galapagos group. Legal costs amounted to €11.5 million in 2023, of which €3.6 million had already accrued prior to 2021. Two settlement payments, in each case in the amount of €2.5 million, were made in December 2023 and in March 2024. (i) Relates to legal and notary fees of €2.0 million in connection with the Group’s refinancing in 2019, with the adjustment made in 2021 as well as consulting expenses related to the extension of the revolving credit facility and associated consulting services in November 2023 and January 2024. (j) Relates the sale of the building and land in France, which resulted in a gain of €1.5 million in 2021 and €4.8 million in 2023 (with a purchase price of €8.0 million). The purchase receivable was factored and a corresponding liability was recognized. In 2021, the adjustment includes the effect from the sale of non-current assets in Sarstedt, Germany (€0.1 million). (k) Relates to a GEA legacy project from 2008. ENEXIO contracted a construction of a dry cooling solution for a power station in Lephalale, South Africa. As part of the purchase price allocation, we recognized a provision of €49.3 million for the estimated risks associated with the project as well as a corresponding receivable from a reimbursement right (70% of the respective provision, €35.5 million). Following the decision of a final court in 2021, the remaining provision of €18.3 million was released. 20 ----- (l) Relates to consulting expenses, impairment of current assets and one-off costs to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, ramp-up costs with respect to the outsourcing of coating services and training as well as out of period income/expenses.

350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.1,We are exposed to risks associated with changes in global economic conditions and economic developments in the countries in which we operate,"As a global manufacturer of heat exchangers and other cooling & heating products, we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the global economy. A slowdown in the global economy and elevated levels of private and public debt in various countries may cause demand to decline in our key markets. The situation may be exacerbated by protectionist tendencies, persistently elevated levels of inflation, uncertainties regarding future monetary policy, armed conflicts that remain unresolved and related migration trends, as well as the spread of infectious diseases. Some recent developments which have significantly impacted global macroeconomic conditions include the ongoing military conflicts in the Ukraine (the “Russia-Ukraine Conflict”), the conflict in Gaza and attacks by Houthi rebels on merchant shipping vessels in the southern Red Sea region as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. See also “—The COVID-19 pandemic had an _adverse effect on our revenue and profitability, cash flow and liquidity, growth plans and prospects, and any future pandemic or other public health incidents could also have similar effects” and “—The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the sanctions imposed by numerous countries and multinational entities in response, as well as countermeasures by Russia, have had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on the global economy, the global capital markets, supply chains, energy prices and supplies, any of which could negatively impact our operations.”_ The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the sanctions and export control measures instituted by the European Union (the “EU”), the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan, among others, contributed to increased inflationary pressures (including increased prices for oil and natural gas), gas supply shortages, supply chain disruptions, market volatility and economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe. The inflationary environment and related intensified general price increases (in particular due to rising energy costs), combined with an increase in interest rates, resulted in a slowdown of customer demand and thus would have had an impact on our growth. While we may increase product prices in order to mitigate the impact of inflation and increases in energy costs, competitive pressures may constrain our ability to do so and we may remain subject to market risks with respect to inflationary pressures. Furthermore, increasing inflation has put upward pressure on the cost of raw materials (see “—Increases in raw material prices, energy costs and prices for input _materials and intermediate products may result in higher manufacturing or purchasing costs and lower margins, and we may not be able to pass such increased costs on to our customers fully or at all”) and other operating costs, and our ability_ to raise prices to counteract increased raw materials prices and other operating costs (such as labor costs) may be limited, which may reduce our operating profit to the extent where we are not able to pass on related price increases to our customers. In addition, our initiatives, in particular the enforcement of price adjustment clauses in our customer contracts, to mitigate headwinds from inflation in our raw materials and other operating costs may not be sufficient to offset these risks. As part of the capital goods industry, we are also exposed to fluctuations in the overall investment climate. Among other things, fluctuations in growth rates or forecasts of gross domestic product, interest rate environments and alterations in government investment subsidies, can result in significant changes in demand for capital goods in the markets in which we operate, potential cancellations of orders already booked or the reorganization of longer-term business relationships. Therefore, our revenue and results of operations are influenced, and will continue to be influenced, by macroeconomic trends and the general state and performance of the global economy. Moreover, uncertainty in connection with trade tensions between the United States and China and further changes to the trade policy of the United States may have a material adverse effect on the overall economies of EU countries and other markets in which we operate, including APAC and MEA. The uncertain political development in the United States and potential restrictions and limitations impacting international trade may have a negative impact on the export economy in general, and on our results of operations in particular. If individual countries take increasingly protectionist measures to improve their competitiveness in the global 23 ----- market and other countries introduce countermeasures, this may result in market access barriers, such as higher import duties or more complicated certification processes in order to reduce imports.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures imposed to contain the outbreak of the disease, particularly in Europe and the United States, our business operations experienced delays and disruptions, including, but not limited to, supply chain interruptions and delays in delivery of products or projects to some of our customers. Potential impacts of any further outbreaks of disease or other public health threats in the future include but are not limited to: (i) staffing shortages if portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures, or other restrictions; (ii) short- or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers; (iii) deterioration in the markets that we or our customers operate in, which may result in lower sales or a lack in the ability of our customers to pay us; and (iv) significant volatility or negative pressure in the financial markets, which could adversely affect our access to capital and/or financing. Any adverse effect on our ability to access capital and/or secure financing could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In response, Russia has sanctioned persons and entities within so-called “non-friendly” countries and terminated gas supply contracts with several countries and entities in Europe. The unpredictable nature of the conflict means that further sanctions, against Russia and Belarus (or Russian and Belarusian entities) and further retaliatory actions by Russia and Belarus against the imposing countries, including the possible expropriation of assets owned by nationals of, or companies based in, such sanctioning countries, including us, may be forthcoming. While we have a subsidiary in Russia, sales in the region were ceased in January 2023 and the Russian subsidiary’s operations were ringfenced for disposal in May 2023. A disposal process is currently being pursued. However, there can be no assurance if and at which terms such disposal may be completed. Under Russian law, among other things, any disposal is required to be made at a discount compared to a valuation prepared by an approved valuer and subject to government approval. For the time being, the Russian entity operates under its own brand name and has established its own supply chain. In addition, in October 2022, we ceased all trading with Belarus. In the year ended December 31, 2023, Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC (our Russian subsidiary) accounted for 1.1% (€16.0 million) of our total revenue. However, our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by the Russia-Ukraine Conflict in a number of ways. The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the related sanctions have created significant global economic uncertainty and have threatened to exacerbate pre-existing global economic challenges such as those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, increasing inflation (including energy prices) and slowing economic growth. The conflict and the related sanctions have also caused and may continue to cause volatility in oil and natural gas prices and could potentially lead to shortages or further energy price increases of these resources. These developments have caused and may continue to cause significant increases in energy prices which, in turn, impact our input costs. In addition, the conflict has provoked a significant return home of Ukraine labour employed in different European countries, creating labour availability tension in some industries, notably manufacturing and transportation. If any of the foregoing risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees could be materially and adversely affected. Such risks may also have the effect of heightening other risks, such as those relating to inflation, capital markets volatility and our ability to access additional capital, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We, our suppliers or our customers may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient financing, including working capital financing, and credit insurance. 24 ----- Our working capital requirements can vary, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers’ production, and the payment terms with its customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or on delivery. If our available cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings to satisfy those needs, as well as potential additional sources of capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms, in sufficient amount or at all. There can be no assurance that we, our suppliers or our customers will continue to have such ability. This may increase the risk that we cannot produce our products or will have to pay higher prices for our inputs.

Demand for our products and services is dependent on the levels of investment in these end-markets and industries, which, in turn, is affected by a number of macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth and GDP, levels of capital investments, inflation and interest rates as well as the availability of credit and financing. These industries and end-markets are also characterized by different trends and market drivers. A negative development in any of our primary end-markets, particularly in Data Centers, could have a negative impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Many countries in which we operate have, or are considering, mandates that require specified percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources. In addition, some countries are considering limits on both the development of new nuclear power plants and on the continued operation of existing nuclear power plants following environmental incidents. Subsidies of renewable energy sources could result in reduced investment in conventional power plants, which tend to be more heat exchanger-intensive than many of the renewable energy technologies currently deployed. Furthermore, the continuing political discussion relating to the future energy mix (among other jurisdictions, in Germany) could lead to delayed investment decisions or to reduced investments by our customers, in particular in the oil and gas and energy sectors, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2023, 11.6% of our revenue resulted from sales to customers in the Power & Energy and, therefore, policy changes in connection with transitions to renewable energy sources could have an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. In addition, demand for products in PHE is affected by demand for heat pumps and has been negatively impacted by regulatory uncertainty in relation to the phase out of conventional heating systems since the end of 2023. Any further changes in government spending and renewable energy policies and initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees if they result in reduced demand for our products and services in traditional coal, nuclear and gas-fired power plants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

For example, we stopped production at our site in Wingles, France, which had been loss-making for a number of years, in 2023, as the market of heat pumps, which experienced a boom as a result of the energy crisis at the beginning of 2022, has experienced decline. In connection with the closure of the production in Wingles, France, we agreed a redundancy plan and incurred other closure costs in an aggregate amount of €14.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. We are also evaluating certain other footprint alignment programs in the EMEA region, e.g. in Western Europe, which could result in the closure of additional sites and redundancy plans. In particular, we are in the final stage of assessing a footprint reduction for one site in Western Europe and expect to conclude this assessment in the near future. While no definitive decision has been taken as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we currently estimate that the closure costs (including costs relating to the termination of leases and relocation costs) as well as redundancy costs will amount to approximately €25 million to €30 million and the total costs will amount to approximately €52 million, which will be – directly or indirectly – funded from the proceeds of the offering of the Notes. See “Use of Proceeds.” However, our actual costs may be significantly higher due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement the planned restructuring measures on time, for example due to the need to find an agreement with employee representatives or landlords. 25 ----- In addition, even if we are able to implement our footprint alignment program as planned, there can be no assurance that such measures result in the efficiency gains or cost savings currently anticipated by us. We may, for example, experience delays in ramping up production at our new sites or such sites may not be as efficient as anticipated due to factors such as availability and skills of the local workforce and the need to use new suppliers. Furthermore, a reduction of our labor force at the affected sites could adversely affect our business, e.g., through strikes, lawsuits, business interruptions or reputational damage. The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Our operations in any of the countries in which we operate, and particularly in emerging markets, are subject to the following risks: - changes in the rate of economic growth; - unsettled political or economic conditions; - expropriation or other governmental actions; - war and social unrest; - terrorist attacks or other armed conflicts; - bribery and corruption; - national and regional labor strikes; - confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies, - deprivation of contract rights; - trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; - reduced protection of intellectual property rights; - restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; - exchange controls; - inflation; - currency fluctuations and devaluation; - the effect of global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions; - market opportunities and operating restrictions; and - changes in financial policy and availability of credit. Moreover, financial and political turmoil in an emerging market may adversely affect the economic conditions of other emerging markets or countries in the region, as investors may move their money to more stable, developed markets. The uncertainty over whether governments will implement changes in policies or regulations affecting these or other factors in the future may contribute to economic uncertainty in such markets. Furthermore, the performance of emerging market economies has historically been affected by the political climate in these countries. Political crises have had a negative impact on the confidence of investors and the public in general, and they have adversely affected the economic development of these countries. 26 ----- In addition, we may conduct business with customers or service or agency partners in countries that are subject to export control regulations, trade embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions imposed by the United States, the European Union or other countries or multilateral organizations. It is possible that any expansion into or within sanctioned countries could adversely impact our ability to gain or retain investors, customers or suppliers or result in reputational harm or other adverse consequences. Further, should legal developments require us to modify or terminate our activities in such countries, we may be exposed to customer complaints or contractual remedies or other adverse consequences.

For example, in the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest customers generated approximately 46% of our Order Intake (year ended December 31, 2022: approximately 32%), with the largest customer generating approximately 25% of Order Intake in the year ended December 31, 2023 (year ended December 31, 2022: approximately 20%). Furthermore, our largest customer generated approximately 18% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our business with any of our largest customers, and in particular our largest customer, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may make fewer business with these customers for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: - reduced demand for our customers’ products or services, including, in particular, as a result of cyclical downturns that disproportionately affect our customers’ industries; - failure to deliver products or solutions that meet our customers’ specifications and our contractual obligations; - technological changes; - reduced or delayed customer requirements; or - bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer.

Order Intake refers to binding customer contracts and purchase orders concluded and received in the respective reporting period at the respective price, while Order Backlog refers to the binding customer contracts and purchase orders concluded and the portion of the associated transaction price for which the amount of sales has not yet been recognized in accordance with IFRS. See “Summary Financial and Other Information—Order Intake and Order _Backlog”. There can be no assurance that these contractual terms will remain unchanged, or that the order intake or order_ backlog will result in an actual recognition of revenue within the period initially anticipated, if at all. We may experience variances in the realization of estimated Order Intake and Order Backlog because of delays or cancellations, scope adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. In addition, many of our contracts grant the customer the right to change, delay or cancel purchase orders at any time after they have been placed against the payment of proven damages suffered by us as a result of such change, delay or cancellation or, in certain cases, against payment of fixed contractual penalties. If the estimated Order Intake or Order Backlog fails to materialize as anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Our Order Intake and Order Backlog does not provide a precise indication of the time period over which we are contractually entitled to receive such revenue and there is no assurance that such revenues will be actually received within the anticipated timeframes or at all. Our Order Intake and Order Backlog are computed based on facts known and assumptions deemed appropriate at the computation date. Our definition of Order Intake and Order Backlog may not necessarily be the same as that used by other companies engaged in activities similar to us.

We compete with both large international market participants and numerous smaller regional and local suppliers that vary depending on the region. See also “Business—Competition.” Our competitive position also varies in the individual product sub-markets (such as for different types of heat exchangers and cooling towers) and regions. If we are unable to continue to provide our services to existing clients, to develop new service portfolios, to attract new clients, to respond to client trends, to increase our operating efficiency and to reduce our operating and overhead costs, we may not be able to successfully compete in the relevant markets. Furthermore, in many of the markets in which we compete, customers place a strong emphasis on local manufacturing capabilities, and we may be unable to quickly expand our manufacturing capacities as required in certain fast growing segments, and thus lose market share. Any expansion undertaken in markets which are generally characterized by lower costs of production may lead to more intense competition in those markets. Should we fail to maintain our market position in the relevant markets or build-up a meaningful market position in new markets, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Any development in markets in which we operate is determined to a certain extent by technological changes and innovation and our strategy is therefore particularly directed towards being perceived as a technology leader in the respective markets. This requires continuous investments in research and development. Despite our efforts and investments, existing or new competitors may develop their products and technologies further or create alternative ones that are more attractively priced, offer higher quality or a broader functionality or are more appealing than our products for other reasons. Furthermore, our research and development efforts may be insufficient to ensure that we are able to meet our customers’ demands on time, or we may be unable to meet product specifications due to a lack of research and development expertise. Additionally, our existing competitors and new entrants may have greater operational, financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to develop new products and compete for opportunities and, as a result, our business may be less successful. If new or more advanced products can be offered at more attractive prices, or if such products are more attractive than our products for other reasons, such as greater functionality, demand for our products could fall, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Some of our customers and end customers are facing increasing pricing pressure and could be affected by costcutting pressures. If our competitors are able to offer products at prices significantly below ours or if new low-cost competitors enter the market, we may be unable to reduce our costs or offer similar pricing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

We invest in technology, new materials and innovation which we believe will be critical to our long-term growth and we must continually adapt our expertise in response to changes in megatrends, emerging technological innovations, industry standards and customer requirements or preferences. In addition, digitalization is progressing rapidly and has already transformed certain sectors. The pace of implementation and adaptation represents an important success factor in this regard and, therefore, also a risk. For customers, one of the determining factors in purchasing our components and systems is the quality of our products and manufacturing processes. Our products are often mission-critical for the applications in which they are used. Given that products that have already been introduced in the market are subject to risks related to the product quality expected by customers, a decrease in the actual and perceived quality of these products and processes could damage our image and reputation, as well as those of our products. There can be no assurance that (i) we will be successful in developing new products or solutions or in bringing them to market in a timely manner, (ii) products or technologies developed by competitors will not render our offerings less competitive, (iii) customers will not substitute our products with those of competitors or alternate technologies, (iv) we will be able to anticipate our customers’ needs and provide products to meet those needs or (v) we will be able to adjust our cost structure in the event of contraction of demand. Should we fail to develop appropriate strategies as a response to these or similar market trends or not be able to enhance existing products, develop new products or keep pace with developing technology, growth opportunities or existing customers could be lost. Furthermore, if we devote resources to the development of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the market or that fail to be commercially viable, all or part of these research and development expenses may be lost and our business may suffer.

In particular, we require various metals such as steel, copper, aluminum and titanium. The market price and availability of these products that we use for our operations can fluctuate sharply depending on the market situation. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant fluctuations in the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange, with a decrease of up to 20% around the outbreak and spread of the pandemic followed by significant price increases in the subsequent two years. A shortage of raw materials and energy sources could also arise from decreases in extraction and production due to natural disasters or political instability or unrest in extracting and producing countries. In addition, since many of these materials, in particular copper and aluminum, are usually purchased in U.S. dollars, a stronger U.S. dollar could represent a further price risk for companies that are outside of the United States and whose operating currency is not tied to the U.S. dollar. In addition, certain countries may impose anti-dumping policies on imports of specific materials from third countries, thereby rendering the cost effectiveness no longer competitive. Currently, we do not use commodity derivatives as hedging instruments against price fluctuations of raw materials. Although we have entered into longer-term supply agreements with various suppliers in order to reduce commodity price risk, we are not fully shielded from the risk of rising commodity prices. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience in the future, material cost increases at the time of purchasing the necessary raw materials for a project as compared to the time when we negotiated the contract for the project. As we may not be able to pass price increases on to our customers, such price increases could reduce our profit margins. However, if we are able to pass price increases on to our customers, this could reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, supply interruptions of production materials, resulting from shortages, labor strikes, supplier insolvencies or other factors could have a negative effect as well. In addition, we also rely on a variety of intermediate products produced by other manufacturers that are integrated into the final products that we provide to the end-customer. These include finished mechanical components such as fans and chiller units. Should our suppliers raise prices, this will result in higher costs. In addition, if we experience limited availability or quality issues with our suppliers of these intermediate products, we could be forced to seek alternative suppliers that may charge higher prices and cause delays in delivering products to customers.

For example, certain customers require that we do not use products manufactured in a certain country (e.g., China or India), source materials from local suppliers or that manufacturing take place at specific facilities (e.g., in Europe). These requirements and preferences may require us to outsource significant functions to manufacturers in foreign countries or otherwise to establish manufacturing capabilities in foreign countries, or to source raw materials, product parts or semifinished goods from countries that are not those from which we would normally source (e.g., due to lower manufacturing costs) if such restrictions were not in place. These requirements may negatively impact our profit margins and result in additional complexity and costs with respect to project management, which, in, turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

These disruptions may result from many reasons, including closures of supplier facilities or critical manufacturing facilities due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions, public health crises as well as logistical complications resulting from weather, other natural disasters or armed conflicts, mechanical failures and delayed customs processing. The lack of a subcomponent or raw material necessary to manufacture one of our products could require us to prolong our production period. For example, in the past, we have experienced temporary supply shortages or constraints in copper and fans which resulted in extended lead times. Risks may also arise in the course of significant projects, including risks beyond our control. These may include problems in contract design, the miscalculation of orders, changes in economic and technical conditions, flaws in project management or inadequate performance by subcontractors. Even when products are ready to be shipped, or have been shipped, delays may arise before they reach our customers. When we cease timely deliveries, we have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the cause of the problem, as well as expeditiously producing and shipping replacement products. In addition, any such 29 ----- disruption in our supply and delivery chains may result in a delay and trigger penalty payments under our customer contracts.

Damage or disruption to such supply or distribution capabilities due to, among other things, weather, natural disasters, terrorism, political instability, public health crises, wars and military conflicts, strikes or the financial instability of suppliers and distribution providers could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products to customers in a timely manner. If our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under purchase orders or supply agreements, we may be unable to locate suitable alternatives, may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain such inputs from other suppliers or even change suppliers. The unavailability, for whatever reason, of any raw material or component required to manufacture our products could require us to decrease or suspend production activities at one or more of our facilities, potentially for a prolonged period, and the risk of any such delay would be borne by us. To the extent that we are unable to effectively manage such events if they occur, or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events with respect to our suppliers and distributors, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Our ability to provide our products to our customers depends on our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with carriers, including trucking and shipping companies. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, adversely impacted global transportation and logistics capacities in the face of increased demand for such services. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine Conflict as well as the recent attacks by Houthi rebels on merchant shipping vessels in the southern Red Sea region has exacerbated this situation, resulting in increased costs of transportation and logistics services, as well as supply chain disruptions. The market has become more constrained, with transportation resources, including drivers of heavy goods vehicles, becoming scarce and causing a corresponding increase in costs. To the extent that our third-party carriers increase their rates in the future, including to reflect higher fuel, maintenance, labor or other costs due to increased inflation, regulation, taxation or otherwise, we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers in a timely manner or at all.

If we devote resources to the pursuit of new solutions, applications, manufacturing technologies or products that fail to be accepted in the marketplace or that fail to become commercially viable, all or part of our research and development (“R&D”) costs may be lost. Furthermore, should we be unable to secure sufficient funding to finance our R&D activities, we could lose our competitive position in a number of important markets. We incurred €16.5 million in R&D expenses in the year ended December 31, 2023 (€14.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022). See “Business—Research and Development.” We also work with strategic partners in the area of research and development, when entering a new market and in connection with large projects, in part within the framework of a partnership (for example, with construction companies), and at other times by way of a cooperation arrangement (for example, with universities and research institutions). In some cases, our partners provide a substantial portion of the capital resources for the project in question or other material services. We, in turn, commit in the underlying agreements to perform certain activities in connection with the project. If we fail to fulfill our obligations under the relevant partnership or cooperation agreements, either in whole or in part, this may lead to claims for damages, contractual penalties or termination of the partnership or cooperation agreement, as applicable, by our partners. In addition, the successful implementation of a project may be endangered or impaired through a breach of contract by one of our partners or through unforeseen events. Moreover, the success of a partnership or cooperation arrangement requires that the partners constructively pursue the same goals. In our joint venture projects, certain intellectual property or proprietary information may (need to) be disclosed to joint venture partners, who may use said technologies exclusively for their own purposes outside of the context of the project. See also “—Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks—There is a risk that we may infringe the intellectual property _rights of third parties.” In addition, in the event that we decide on a divestment of or withdrawal from a joint venture,_ there is a risk that no buyer will be found for the shares in the joint venture, there will be no other way to sell the shares for other reasons or that the partner will claim damages. There is also a risk that, in the event of the loss of a joint venture partner, we will need to invest considerable resources in a new partnership.

Some of our products also have a much higher internally manufactured cost component. Therefore, changes in product mix from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our results of operations and profitability through a change in our manufacturing costs and specifically in our manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue. In addition, certain large projects make up a substantial portion of our revenue, and as these projects are phased out, this can also have a significant impact on our reported revenue and margins for our product groups that are active in the project business (in particular KTS) from quarterto-quarter or from year-to-year.

In particular, our business in KTS, which is our largest product group by revenue, is largely project-based. Our customers may also require certain upgrade projects for existing facilities with unforeseen complications. These projects and other efforts of this type are subject to risks of cost overruns or delays inherent in any large project as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: - shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor; - work stoppages and labor disputes; - unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment; - local customs strikes or related work slowdowns that could delay importation of equipment or materials; - weather interferences; - difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or approvals or in meeting permit or approval conditions; - design and engineering problems; - inadequate regulatory support infrastructure in the local jurisdiction; - unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials; - unanticipated actual or purported change orders; - client acceptance delays; and - failure or delay of third-party equipment vendors or service providers. The risks described above are particularly relevant when we enter into long-term engineering contracts, which represent a significant part of our business. Under some of these contracts, we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with the project’s completion. In addition, these contracts may provide for warranty obligations that remain in force for several years after the project’s completion. See also “Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks—We are exposed _to product liability claims and the risk that our products may not fulfill customer requirements or specifications.”_ We have experienced and may continue to experience several performance and quality issues with the products, components and services provided by subcontractors, which may substantially affect the cost of a project. In certain industries, such as the petrochemical industry, the quality expectations are particularly high, leading to very intensive service and labor costs, and poor-quality issues may more easily result in a deviation from the original cost calculation and time schedule for a project. Payment schedules for our large projects can also have a significant impact on, and result in volatility of our, liquidity and working capital position. We typically negotiate upfront and milestone payments which result in cash inflows. Over time this advanced cash is reduced as projects are started and materials are purchased due to requirements for the manufacturing of the equipment. Cash balances can also be impacted by the timing of payments and earlier or delayed payments can have an impact. The failure to complete an upgrade, refurbishment or new construction project on time, or at all, or the inability to complete a project in accordance with its design specifications, may result in loss of revenues, penalties, or delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a project contract. Additionally, capital expenditures for large upgrade, refurbishment and construction projects could materially exceed our planned expenditures. If we experience substantial delays and cost overruns in our projects, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. 31 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In addition, construction sites where we carry out projects pose specific safety risks. Operational disruptions or interruptions at our facilities and sites may occur, including for reasons beyond our control (such as aircraft crashes, terrorism, epidemics, political unrest, natural disasters or other acts of God) or for other reasons (such as fire, floods, explosion, release of hazardous substances, or strikes, as well as interruptions relating to the supply of energy, raw materials and pre-products or IT failures). For example, in recent years, we experienced delays in connection with leakage on hydraulic press cylinders, resulting in temporary unplanned downtime, pressing tooling breakdowns and brazing furnace problems with vacuum pumps. Furthermore, our facility in Knoxville, Tennessee, was recently damaged following unusually heavy rainfall and we have been forced to reallocate production capacity to other plants, including in Europe as a result. This is expected to result in production delays and increased costs. Operational disruptions and interruptions and process weaknesses may lead to significant production downtimes and interruptions relating to services provided and products delivered to customers. If disruptions occur, alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take significant time to start or transfer production. Each of these scenarios could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. If any of our production facilities is unable to manufacture our products for an extended period of time, our sales may decline due to the disruption and we may not be able to manufacture sufficient volumes of products to meet our customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. In addition, our reputation and important customer relationships are dependent on our customers’ confidence in the safety, quality and environmental compatibility of our services and projects. Actual or alleged accidents at projects, safety defects, defective performance, quality defects or environmental incidents could lead to substantial financial liability and could affect the demand for our products and services with resultant adverse financial consequences. Accidents occurring during the execution of major projects can cause serious damage to persons and property and could permanently damage our reputation in the public opinion, even if we were not actually responsible for causing such damage and no fault can be attributed to us.

Trade receivables amounted to €158,880 thousand as of December 31, 2023. The amount of overdue trade receivables is an indication of the risk that we run in connection with potential bad debts. As of December 31, 2023, overdue trade and other receivables from third parties amounted to €43.1 million, or 27.1% of our total receivables trade and other receivables from third parties, and bad debt allowances on our total trade receivables amounted to €12.3 million. In the past, we have from time to time experienced payment default by certain customers that were unable to pay for delivered goods due to financial difficulties. Even though we regularly collect credit information on new customers and, if needed, on existing customers in an attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk, we may be unsuccessful in identifying significant potential credit risks. Additionally, other parties with whom we have entered into financial or other arrangements could also be in default, e.g., in the event of their insolvency or where they have no access to credit facilities. For example, we have in the past been unable to hold a supplier accountable for defective products due to the insolvency of the supplier.

A significant portion of our business, in particular in KTS, consists of projects that depend on financing being available to our customers. A general decline in demand or a shortage of available financing opportunities may make it more difficult to implement such projects. Existing orders may be deferred or cancelled, or customers may experience payment difficulties. Our working capital requirements can vary, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers’ production, and the payment terms agreed on with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or on delivery or customers fail to pay or seek to renegotiate lower milestone payments. If our available cash flows from 32 ----- operating activities are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we will be required to look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings to satisfy those needs, as well as potential additional sources of capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms, in sufficient amount or at all.

With respect to our component business, we record revenue and corresponding trade receivables when products are delivered to customers, and with respect to certain products, when customer acceptance occurs following delivery. Payments received prior to product delivery, or customer acceptance, as applicable, are recorded as unearned revenue. Any payment delays cause capital to be tied up in receivables, which may result in pressure on our cash flows and liquidity. We sell a portion of our trade receivables to financial services companies under a factoring agreement; these are derecognized in our financial statements once the majority of the risks and rewards have been substantially transferred to the financial services company. With respect to the project business, receivables and revenues from construction contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method. Advance payments on construction contracts are reported separately as a liability. Although we typically benefit from customer prepayments for newly-awarded projects in our project business, we have experienced in the past and may in the future experience payment delays or customers deciding to cease prepayments as a result of customers revising their trading terms. We may experience low accounts receivable turnover and payment delays due to an unexpected abandonment or delay of projects, cancelation of orders and payment delays from certain customers due to financial difficulties.

We determine the value of the intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting principles. Goodwill is subject to an impairment test which must be performed at least annually or if particular circumstances or changes in circumstances occur that indicate impairment. Within the context of carrying out the annual impairment tests in accordance with IFRS 3/IAS 36, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units where synergies are to be expected. A comparison of the fair values attributed to the units with their carrying values including goodwill has so far not resulted in the need for impairments. Due to the significance that general economic factors have in the context of assessing the value of goodwill, a continued global downturn and a potential rise in interest rates worldwide could potentially necessitate an impairment of goodwill. These non-cash impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods, and could also significantly impact certain financial ratios. In addition, deferred tax assets for tax loss carry forwards are only recognized if it is probable that taxable income will be available for the loss carry forwards to be utilized. Deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of management estimates on the expected timing and amount of income to be taxed and the future tax planning strategies. Therefore, an impairment loss may have to be recognized if the expectations on which the amount of deferred taxes are based are not fulfilled.

In addition, we have a number of historical pension plans (generally closed to new employees) that provide for the payment of retirement benefits and certain disability and survivor benefits. After meeting certain qualifications, an employee’s right to future benefits vests. In most cases, the future benefits payable are determined on the basis of the employee’s length of service, earnings and position. New employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions. As part of the general benefits provided all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their compensation. Under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of up to 100 % of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit. See “Business—Employees—Pension Liabilities”. As of December 31, 2023, the present value of our defined benefit obligations under such plans amounted to €25.4 million. Changes in interest rates expose us to additional risk (non-cash) with respect to our defined benefit obligations, and the low interest rate environment in recent years has increased this risk due to the relatively long period of the obligations.

In particular, as a result of our international operations, we have significant assets and liabilities outside the Eurozone, particularly in China, the United States, South Africa, Brazil, India, Poland, Czech Republic as well as Great Britain. These assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollar, British pound or other local currencies. When the net asset values are converted into euro, the currency fluctuations result in period to period changes in those net asset values. Our equity position reflects these changes in net asset values. We hedge foreign currency items as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates, and limit some currency risk, mainly from sales and procurement transactions. However, hedging may not eliminate all risk. Despite hedging arrangements, changes in exchange rates may affect the translation into euro of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries that use a currency other than the euro as their functional currency. A depreciation of other currencies against the euro will mean that, despite constant sales volumes and nominally constant prices, we will, after translation into euro, generate lower revenue and profits for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. A number of our subsidiaries report their results in currencies other than the euro, which requires us to convert the relevant items into euro when preparing our consolidated financial statements.

If any accidents or incidents occur, we could be subject to administrative, civil or even criminal liability and litigation, which could result in us incurring fines, penalties, other sanctions or (temporary) operational impediments, including extensive regulatory supervision and operational or marketing limitations. The realization of any of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 35 ----- We also operate in countries where environmental, (occupational) health and safety laws, regulations and standards and their enforcement are still developing.

Greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional greenhouse gas requirements are in various stages of development. Implementing such laws and regulations can be complex and may result in additional material costs for us. In the EU, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism for trading in carbon dioxide emission allowances. For example, the EU Emission Trading System (the “EU ETS”) imposes an EUwide emissions cap applying to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by in-scope operations and provides for the trade, with allowances for such emissions for certain sectors and companies. As a result of the EU ETS, we are and may in the future be further affected by increasing costs related to greenhouse gas emissions. The EU ETS was comprehensively revised in 2023 and the corresponding legal acts came into force in May and June 2023. The revisions include a plan to annually reduce the EU-wide emissions cap, with a linear reduction factor increasing from 2.2% (2021-2023) to 4.3% (2024-2027) and 4.4% (2028-2030). The revisions provide for the previous carbon leakage protection measures, in particular free allocation, to be gradually phased out and introduces the so-called Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism aims to address risks of carbon leakage by subjecting imported and domestic products to equivalent carbon pricing. Generally, EU manufacturers will need to buy allowances for their emissions and importers from outside the EU will likewise need to buy carbon certificates, corresponding to the carbon price that they would have paid if they had manufactured the products in the EU. Under the currently applicable EU ETS, the EU-wide emissions cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 2.2% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU between 2021 and 2023. This linear factor will be raised to 4.3% from 2024 to 2027 and to 4.4% from 2028 to 2030. The revision also includes a one-off reduction of the EU-wide quantity of emissions allowances by 90 million in 2024 and by 27 million in 2026. According to this reduction path, the total quantity of newly issued allowances will be zero in 2040. Until then, the transitional free allocation allowances will continue on a reduced scale.

The process of seeking approvals can be timeconsuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. Approvals may not be granted to us on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure to obtain or maintain, these authorizations or approvals would adversely affect our ability to conduct certain production-related activities, to introduce new products, to continue distributing and marketing existing products and to generate revenue from those products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our products (and the raw materials used to produce them) are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analyses of the substances they contain. We must comply with a broad range of regulations relating to the authorization, testing, manufacturing and labelling of our products and those of our suppliers. In some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, these types of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue. Further, Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) stipulates general rules for the marketing of substances, mixtures and articles in the European economic area, and imposes various obligations which vary according to the hazardous properties of the substances, their form, quantity and concentration, as well as the role of the actors in the supply chain. Applicable obligations include, among others, a duty to register substances, notify of substances in articles, communicate information in the supply chain and down to the customers, comply with restrictions and/or authorization requirements. REACH also imposes substantial obligations with regard to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of building block and semi-specialty chemicals. Pursuant thereto, we are required to demonstrate that the risks to human health or the environment associated with our use of relevant substances are adequately controlled by carrying out periodic testing of their toxicological level. These testing procedures can be costly and time-intensive and may lead to an increase in production or purchasing costs. All substances currently required for our business are registered in accordance with REACH. However, regulatory review of the registrations may result in a need to update registrations. Furthermore, the registration of additional substances contained in new products manufactured or imported by us may become necessary. This, as well as maintaining ongoing broader compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements (not merely registration requirements), may give rise to further costs and, under certain circumstances, even operational impacts. Respective compliance also pertains to Regulation 37 ----- (EC) No 1272/2008 on Classification, Labelling and Packaging, as amended from time to time (the “CLP Regulation”), which sets out hazard classes and criteria for the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures and imposes related classification, labelling and packaging requirements on, in particular, manufacturers, importers and suppliers. Both REACH and the CLP are amended from time to time, in particular in relation to new substances being identified as substances of very high concern, being subjected to new authorization, restriction or information communication requirements or substances, including raw materials, chemicals or substances contained in products, being (re-)classified under the CLP. Compliance with amended laws and regulations subjects our operations to new or altered regulatory requirements and may further impact our operations and give rise to significant costs and other impacts, such as substances not being available on time for production and products not being marketable. The EU is considering a ban or the introduction of thresholds on so-called “forever chemicals” – per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), a large class of thousands of synthetic perpetual chemicals that are used throughout society but increasingly deemed to be environmental pollutants, with some being associated with negative effects on human health, are not directly used in our products. The EU-wide regulation is expected to come into force in 2026. We are therefore exposed to the risk that materials currently used by us in the production of most of our gasketed plate heat exchangers, which contain PFAS, may become more expensive or, potentially, may no longer be readily available in the future. We are working closely with our key gasket suppliers and monitoring the situation, particularly with the aim of using alternative and recently developed compounds with PFAS levels that will be below the acceptable thresholds of the future regulation. While we expect the alternative materials, which are currently in the validation process, to be similar in cost to those materials currently in use, there is no assurance that the alternative materials will be more cost-effective or, conversely, that they will exceed the current costs. Any of the foregoing outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

We have a global production footprint, with production sites in more than 20 countries around the world. Therefore, we are subject to various laws and regulations in the different jurisdictions in which we are active. Due to the industry in which we operate, these laws and regulations impose comprehensive compliance obligations on us and restrict our offering and operating activities. These obligations and restrictions, in turn, can be difficult to administer because of their scope, dynamic nature and varied requirements and, as such, our global operations expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, such laws and regulations. In addition, rapidly changing export control rules and regulations have in the past resulted in us, and may in the future lead to a risk of inadvertently violating specific countries’ export control regulations and laws. Our failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws and regulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as significant financial penalties and/or operational implications.

The granting of patents does not necessarily imply that they are effective or that potential patent claims can be enforced to the degree required or desired. Additionally, the patents we have applied for or intend to file for registration in connection with new technological developments may not be granted in each of the countries where we consider this necessary or desirable. Third parties may infringe our patents and/or intellectual property rights and we may, for legal or factual reasons, be unable to halt such infringements. With respect to certain product areas, continuous further development of products and maintaining technical leadership is necessary to prevent competitors from copying our products. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to profit from the advances in technology we have achieved, which could lead to a reduction in future results of operations. This could affect our competitive position and any resulting reduction in revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, given that our competitors also have pending applications for patent protection. With regard to patent rights, if we have not validly claimed such inventions, employees may assert claims against us in relation to the ownership rights of the invention or remuneration. This may result in the prohibition of our ability to use the affected technologies or the need to purchase licenses, alter manufacturing processes or pay compensation. Know-how and industrial secrets that are not patented or 38 ----- cannot be patented are also of significant importance in our business, in particular in areas with technologically demanding products and production processes. For example, there is a risk that our competitors may have been granted patents for products and production processes that, at the time in question, we had already produced or implemented without a patent. In the relevant country, this could lead to restrictions regarding the sale of the affected products, the application of the relevant production processes or to an obligation to pay license fees. We may not be able to protect our industrial secrets and third parties may develop the same or similar know-how independently. Any restrictions on delivery and production due to patent infringement, or production interruptions resulting from patent infringement, whether due to a change in a manufacturing process or due to other reasons, or the subsequent acquisition of corresponding licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

According to the amended version of the Emissions Trading Directive, the free",13.3.5,"We handle personal data in the ordinary course of our business, and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of that data could result in legal liability for us and reputational harm to our business.","From time to time, we process personal data (including, in certain instances, names and addresses) as part of our business, and therefore we are subject to and must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws across several jurisdictions. Moreover, data protection laws and rules impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers and could make us liable in the event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party access. Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber-security breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches, and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access. We, our distributors, suppliers and other business partners may be the subject of breaches of security by hackers. A future breach of our system or that of one of our distributors, suppliers or other business partners may subject us to material losses or liability, including fines, claims for unauthorized use of personal and sensitive data or other claims. Inadequate technology or security measures, the failure to follow proper security protocols or other factors may result in data loss or unauthorized disclosure or a compromise or breach of our systems and the data we receive, store and process. Security measures may be breached or data may be lost or disclosed by third parties (for example, through social engineering techniques to induce disclosure of passwords or other sensitive information, other actions to gain access to our data or our customers’ or partners’ data, or the use of ineffective security measures or failure to follow proper security protocols), human error (such as the use of weak passwords or unencrypted devices), malfeasance or vulnerabilities (including vulnerabilities in third-party products upon which we rely). A misuse of such data or a cyber-security breach could harm our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, or result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under any applicable international laws or regulations. For example, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations on privacy, information security and data protection, the main and most relevant of which relate to the collection, protection and use of personal and business data, including the EU Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”), the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, the “BDSG”), the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation, (together, the “UK GDPR”). See “Regulation—Data Privacy.” The costs of complying with the GDPR are increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. For example, the GDPR and the UK GDPR impose substantial fines and other administrative sanctions for violations of the data protection rules. The imposition of these sanctions will depend on the nature of the infringed provision and the concomitant circumstances, and may include formal warnings, cease-and-desist orders and fines of up to €20 million (or £17.5 million) or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the undertaking in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for each infraction. Additional penalties may apply, such as an immediate prohibition of the data processing activity. Further adverse consequences of an infringement of the GDPR may include civil claims for material and immaterial damages from the affected individuals. Implementing legislation of individual Member States, such as the BDSG, also provides for criminal sanctions for specific violations, which may also entail the loss of any profits realized as a result of infringements of the GDPR. Finally, in addition to these regulatory risks, any infringement of such legislation could lead to reputational risk and significantly undermine customers’ trust in our business. See “—Our business may suffer _if our reputation is damaged.” In addition, if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries_ and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our products, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. In the United States, risks of actual or perceived non-compliance includes enforcement actions under federal and state laws, rules and regulations. In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have approved, and may propose and approve in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must comply or that contractually apply to us. US state laws in this area are complex and developing rapidly and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate, including measures relating to privacy, data security and 39 ----- data breaches. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As we seek to expand our business, we are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Despite our efforts, our practices may not comply, now or in the future, with all such laws, regulations, requirements, and obligations and this could, among other things, result in the following: claims, proceedings, or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities; the incurrence of significant defense-related expenses or the imposition of monetary penalties; an increase in our costs of doing business; a loss of customers or manufacturers; an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, and business; the requirement to change our operations and/or to cease using certain data sets; or an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of noncompliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy or security or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business. In China, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding cyber-security and data protection. For example, under China’s Cybersecurity Law, any collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information of a Chinese citizen through a network by the network operator should be based on the three principles of legitimacy, justification and necessity and requires the consent of the data subject and the disclosure to the latter of the rules, purposes, methods and ranges of such collection. The Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”) further clarifies the scope of application, the definitions of personal information and sensitive personal information, the legality of personal information processing and the basic requirements of notice and consent, among other things. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of the prior year’s total annual revenue for the personal information processor and/or a suspension of services or data processing activities. Other potential penalties include the imposition of a fine of up to RMB 1 million on the person in charge or directly responsible personnel and, in serious cases, criminal liability under other local Chinese law. The PIPL also prohibits responsible personnel for violations of the PIPL from holding high level management or data protection officer positions in relevant enterprises. China’s data localization requirements are becoming increasingly common in sector-specific regulations. We cannot predict what impact the new laws and regulations, in particular the Data Security Law or PIPL, or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in China due to their recent enactment and the limited guidance available, particularly on PIPL. It is also generally unclear how the laws, which are often broadly drafted and leave considerable discretion to the relevant government authorities, will be interpreted and enforced in practice by those authorities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

According to the amended version of the Emissions Trading Directive, the free",13.3.6,Labor disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs.,"We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws applicable to our business activities in certain countries are relatively rigorous and provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition, many of our employees are members of unions or represented by works councils, employee representatives or other bodies. For example, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements in various countries, including Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands. Pursuant to such agreements, we are often required to inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or works councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These employee protections and rights may consequently require us to spend greater time and expense in altering or amending employees’ terms of employment or making headcount reductions. These labor laws and consultative procedures could also limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that disrupt our business. Although we believe our relations with employees are good, our operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the future, including disagreements with works councils or other employee co-determination bodies. We are involved in negotiations with regard to collective bargaining agreements, some of which may be approaching expiration or renewal (for example, in Germany), on an ongoing basis in the ordinary course of our business. This is a process which ultimately results in higher costs for us, whether in the form of wage increases or in terms of the repercussions for our operations of strikes by our workforce. Additionally, in the event of non-compliance with certain welfare obligations stipulated in the collective bargaining agreements applicable in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France and Spain, it is possible that the collective wage currently in place pursuant to our “in-house” or company-specific collective bargaining agreements could return to the wage levels pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements for the chemicals industry.

We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged failure of our products that may result in a failure of an industrial process, 40 ----- and such failure may cause significant financial losses, injury or death, which could negatively affect our business. For example, in 2019, an explosion and fire occurred at the site of one of our end-customers and is claimed to have a link to certain products delivered by us. Following the incident, the insurer of our end-customer asserted that our product was responsible for the explosion and fire and therefore liable for damages. While we rejected these assertions and are not party to any legal proceedings in relation to the incident of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we may still be exposed to material liability in the future. Awards of damages, settlement amounts and fees and expenses resulting from this or other claims and the public relations implications of any such claims, could have an adverse effect on our business. We also cooperate with manufacturers and other suppliers which provide us with the materials and intermediate products used in our operations. As we do not have direct control over the quality of the materials and intermediate products manufactured or supplied by such third parties, we are exposed to a risk related to the quality of such materials and intermediate products. We may use materials and intermediate products in our operations that are subsequently suspected to contain defects of quality or to have been the cause of damage to persons or property. Any of these types of allegations may subject us to reputational damage or may form the basis for claims that clients and other third parties assert against us. This may require us to expend additional resources to take appropriate corrective action with regard to affected products or systems, in addition to potential costs for penalties. We have in the past faced performance issues with respect to our products and projects, including issues relating to vibrations, icing and insufficient performance of products or components. Claims asserted against us can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of personnel for significant time periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The availability and cost of insurance to cover claims for damages caused by us or our products are subject to market forces that we do not control, and such insurance would not cover damages to our reputation. A lost product or performance liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against claims relating to the products sold or services performed by us, the mere assertion of such claims could have a negative impact on client confidence in our services and products. In addition, even if a liability claim is not brought before court, it may lead to additional costs, for instance for product or component replacements, performance tests extension, correction of defects and additional engineering.

While we believe that the types and amounts of insurance coverage we currently maintain are generally in line with customary practice in our industry and are adequate for our business operations, our insurance does not cover all potential risks associated with our business or for which we may otherwise be liable, and the scope of coverage of our existing policies and policy limits may ultimately prove to be insufficient to adequately cover all aspects of certain risks, hazards or liabilities for which we seek to make a claim. For example, our insurance policies may not cover, or fully cover, us against political risks, global conflicts, public health crises, cyber-security risks, natural catastrophes, weather and other climate-related risks or the inherent hazards of our operations. Our Russian subsidiary can no longer be insured under our Group international insurance programs and, therefore, no longer benefit from the financial interest coverage thereunder. As a result, the Russian subsidiary has taken out local stand-alone insurance policies on standard market terms in Russia. In addition, our policies are subject to standard deductibles and exclusions that could affect our ability to make a claim. Consequently, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us from all risks that may arise or in amounts sufficient to compensate any material loss.

As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission allowances will have to purchase a significant, and steadily increasing, share of increasingly pricy emission allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial additional costs for such companies. An exemption is available for certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation of plants to countries with less stringent climate protection laws (a phenomenon known as “Carbon Leakage”). These industries are determined by the European Commission every five years. The designated industries will be allocated emission allowances free of charge for the period until 2023 at 100% of a pre-determined quantity. It cannot be determined with certainty whether the exemption applies to us. In this respect, enormous costs could be incurred for the purchase of emission certificates. Further, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would establish a nationwide limit on greenhouse gases. In addition, the US Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has issued regulations limiting 36 ----- greenhouse gas emissions from mobile and stationary sources pursuant to the US Clean Air Act. The Carbon Pollution Standards for New, Modified and Reconstructed Power Plants apply to brand new sources built in the future or to an existing unit that meets certain, specific conditions. They reflect the degree of emission limitations achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction for which the EPA has determined that emission reduction has been adequately demonstrated for each type of unit. While we are currently not subject to such CO2 emissions regulations, our plant in Muskegon, Michigan, United States is considered a so-called stationary source under the US Clean Air Act. In case of changes to current legislation, we could in the future be subject to limitations in this regard. When effective, such measures could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional or more restrictive emission control technology, curtail operations, or increase our operating costs. Thus, any additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including through a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In particular, the Notes and borrowings under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at a variable rate, which could rise significantly in the future. The material increases in global inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and expectations that annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least in part by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting impact on energy markets) has forced central banks of the major world economies, including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, to significantly increase market interest rates in a very short timeframe.

Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that the Issuer may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements.

Some reforms are already effective, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented. EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, you should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time). In addition, the development of future alternatives to EURIBOR may result in the Notes performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR had not developed.

See “Description of the Notes—Interest.” The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt.

The Cash RCF Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances and any rollover drawings and/or by way of ancillary facilities and/or fronted ancillary facilities. The L/G RCF Facility may be utilized by the issue of bank guarantees and letters of credit under ancillary facilities. In the ordinary course of business, amounts under the L/G RCF Facility are likely to operate in a contingent manner rather than requiring immediate repayment. However, in the types of circumstances where the Collateral may become enforceable, including upon a payment default or insolvency-related default under the Notes, the Cash RCF Facility and the L/G RCF Facility, these contingent claims are likely to crystallize. This may occur, for instance, if third parties that have been provided guarantees under contracts call on their guarantees. This will mean that amounts under such facilities will become due and payable and will recover the proceeds of Collateral in priority to the Notes.

See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” For example, if the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries acquire assets subject to security interests securing other indebtedness, such security interests will be permitted to remain in place under the terms of the Indenture and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or the Guarantees equally and ratably. To the extent that the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries pledges any assets for the benefit of other debt without also securing the Notes and the Guarantees, the Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to such debt to the extent of the value of such assets.

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements (including registration requirements), statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, it may be difficult for the Security Agent to sell our assets in an enforcement scenario. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. For example, pursuant to Sections 55 et seq. of the German Foreign Trade Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) a purchase by a person not resident in the European Union of shares in a German company may under certain circumstances require an approval by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie). Not obtaining 50 ----- such an approval may – depending on the character of the purchased company’s business – render the purchase provisionally invalid (schwebend unwirksam). The denial of the approval would either render the purchase permanently invalid or lead to additional obligations with respect to the relevant shares or the rescission (Rückabwicklung) of the purchase. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given, when required, to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. In particular, to the extent that any other first-priority and pre-existing security interests permitted under the Indenture and the terms of the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, these parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor and/or security provider will be subject to certain defenses available to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable. The amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. 51 ----- For example, guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft _mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as general partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the_ purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Guarantees and/or Collateral provided by a GmbH, including by German Holdco, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Guarantee is granted) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. In addition, any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 of the BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, among others, the third-party creditor had colluded with the affiliate (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third-party creditors of the GmbH. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG. As a result, a Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Guarantee or the Security Documents could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Guarantee or Security Interest cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above-mentioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or Security Interest should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Guarantees or Security Interests apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Guarantees and Security Interests may be subject to similar limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_ Similarly, a Guarantor incorporated and/or established in Luxembourg (the “Luxembourg Guarantor”) may only encumber its assets or provide a guarantee in accordance with its corporate objects and for its corporate benefit. There is no Luxembourg legislation governing group companies which specifically regulates the establishment, organization and liability of groups of companies. Consequently, the concept of group interest as opposed to the interest of the individual corporate entity is not expressly recognized. Except as described below, a company may, in principle, not encumber its assets or provide guarantees in favor of group companies in general (at least as far as parent companies and fellow subsidiaries of its parent companies are concerned). Based on current case law and legal literature, a Luxembourg company may, in principle, validly assist other group companies, in accordance with the provisions of the Luxembourg companies Law, if: - they are part of a group; - it can be established that the guarantor derives a benefit from granting such assistance or that, at least, there is no disruption of the balance of interests in the group to the detriment of the Luxembourg Guarantor; and - the assistance is not, in terms of the amounts involved, disproportionate to the Luxembourg Guarantor’s financial means and the benefits derived from granting such assistance. In addition, the Guarantee and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its respective guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law.

However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or the relevant Collateral, as applicable, may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. Luxembourg laws contain similar specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of insolvency proceedings, the so-called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency of the relevant person by the bankruptcy trustee or receiver in an insolvency proceeding of the relevant debtor or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties under Luxembourg law if: (i) the act was performed with the intention to defraud the creditor; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the relevant debtor’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the relevant person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the security interests or the granting of a Guarantee, involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of such Notes, the granting of such security interests for the benefit of holders of the relevant Notes or the granting of such Guarantees, as applicable, (i) could be declared unenforceable against the creditor that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act (under Luxembourg law outside of bankruptcy proceedings) or (ii) except for security interests which qualify as financial collateral arrangements under the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Financial Collateral Law 2005”), declared void vis-à-vis all third-party creditors pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (under Luxembourg law in the case of bankruptcy proceedings).

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral, and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees of the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes. Instead, they will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Guarantees in accordance with the terms thereof. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests or Guarantee claims and will not be entitled to take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral securing the Notes or the Guarantees, except through the Trustee, who will (on behalf of the holders of the Notes and subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent with respect to the Collateral or the Guarantees. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions, such as Germany, may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. In certain jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the respective Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment with respect to the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment with respect to the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Accordingly, the parity of the Notes, obligations under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, including the Cash RCF Facility and the L/G RCF Facility, and any other obligations secured by the Collateral will be implemented by way of the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, the holders of the Notes must rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor Agreement to implement parity among the holders of the Notes and the other pari passu secured creditors, including the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement. In the event that the Intercreditor Agreement does not ensure parity on a contractual basis, the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the obligations under the Notes.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control, holders of the Notes may in certain circumstances require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Change _of Control.” The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these_ amounts when they become due.

The Issuer cannot assure you that it would have sufficient funds to repay its outstanding indebtedness that it would be required to prepay or offer to purchase or that became immediately due and payable as a result. The Issuer may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases and the Issuer cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions in the Issuer’s other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict it from making such required repurchases. A Change of Control may result in an event of default under or acceleration of the Issuer’s then-existing indebtedness (including under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement), and the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness even if the Change of Control itself does not.

We have built our strategic pillars on (i) High Tech applications and solutions, in particular for Data Centers with liquid and free cooling, (ii) Green Tech applications and solutions in various vertical markets, such as Power & Energy, HVAC, Hydrogen, Liquified Natural Gas, Carbon Capture Storage, (iii) Conventional applications, such as in the Refrigeration, Food & Beverage, Chemicals and Oil & Gas vertical markets, as well as (iv) Service applications across all our vertical markets and product groups. Our diversified presence across regions and transformative industries are supported by long-term underlying megatrends, such as digitalization, energy transition and environmental concerns in general. Based on the breath of our product portfolio, extensive global footprint, and diverse end-markets, as well as our technology leadership position and R&D capabilities, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth trends in our vertical markets. Since 2021, under our new management, we have been implementing a comprehensive strategic program known as “High Five”. The High Five program is designed to build a long-term sustainable business and comprises the following five strategic pillars: (i) Grow High Tech, (ii) Grow Green Tech, (iii) More Service, (iv) Grow APAC & Americas and (v) More Digitalization, with greater emphasis on reducing complexity through digitalization. At the same time, we divested unprofitable businesses, such as the Enexio in recent years. Since the beginning of 2021 and despite several external shocks, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the spike in energy prices and inflation caused thereby, our Order Intake, Revenue and Normalized EBITDA have increased from €1,099.3 million, €931.7 million and €78.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €1,697.9 million, €1,347.9 million and €146.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Historically, our business operations have been primarily divided into four product groups: Kelvion Thermal Solutions (“KTS”), Refrigeration Technologies (“RT”), Plate Heat Exchangers (“PHE”) and Machine Cooling Systems (“MCS”). We also consider our key vertical markets and geographic regions in the management of our business. - _KTS provides air fin coolers and cooling towers for installations with large cooling requirements as well as air dryers used to remove humidity from air streams. KTS focuses on providing customized solutions 65 ----- and primarily serves Data Centers, Power & Energy, Oil & Gas and Chemicals vertical markets. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, KTS accounted for 44.6% of our revenue. - _RT supplies standard and customized heat exchangers for cooling and removing heat in different applications using air and liquid cooling methods. The primary vertical markets are HVAC, refrigeration applications and Data Centers. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, RT accounted for 20.5% of our revenue. - _PHE offers a range of gasketed, brazed and welded plate heat exchangers for a variety of applications and vertical markets, including HVAC, Food & Beverage, Chemicals, Power & Energy and Heavy & Light Equipment. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, PHE accounted for 17.9% of our revenue. - _MCS supplies heat exchangers for power generation, power transmission, large engine applications (marine and off-highway) and Green Tech applications such as biomass, green hydrogen, or renewable energies. The primary vertical markets are Transportation, Heavy & Light Equipment, Power & Energy and Oil & Gas. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, MCS accounted for 14.3% of our revenue. Since the beginning of 2024, the RT, MCS and PHE have been managed on a regional basis in the following geographic regions – Americas, APAC and EMEA. In addition, all our product groups’ activities are complemented by a comprehensive after-sales support and services offering, reflecting our ability to support our customers with full-service packages thereby reducing their operating costs. We provide services both for our own products as well as for third-party products, managed on a centralized and global basis across our product groups. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our service business generated revenues of €251 million and for the year ended December 31, 2023 revenues of €259 million, an increase of 21% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We have a large and diverse customer base, including many blue-chip customers, and have built long-standing customer partnerships. Our customer base comprises more than 19,000 active customers (i.e., customers that have placed an order with us in the last 24 months) and repeat orders over multiple years from more than 12,000 customers. Our customer base is also diversified across vertical markets and geographies. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Order Intake by strategic pillar can be broken down as follows: circa 39% in High Tech, circa 36% in Conventional applications, circa 17% in services and circa 7% in Green Tech. During the same period, the Order Intake by geography comprised circa 45% in EMEA, circa 42% in Americas and circa 13% in APAC. Headquartered in Herne, Germany, we operate in 24 countries around the world, with 22 production facilities, 33 service centers and 19 engineering centers as of March 31, 2024. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated total revenue of €1,401 million and Normalized EBITDA of €157.2 million.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.1,"Demand for our products and solutions in our strategic pillars, particularly in Green Tech and High Tech","Our business and results of operations are influenced by trends in our key strategic pillars and key vertical markets as well as changes in the general macroeconomic conditions in our core geographic regions which, in turn, drive the level of demand for our products and solutions. For example, the High Tech market, which accounted for 39% of our Order Intake for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, is projected to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2022 to 2027 due to strong and growing demand for data centers. The Green Tech market, which accounted for 7% of our Order Intake for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% between 2022 to 2027 based on an increasing focus on energy efficiency and environmental awareness, which, in turn, is driving regulatory changes aimed at climate protection and heat recovery for residential and commercial buildings as well as for industrial applications (source: Frost & Sullivan Report, MarketsandMarkets Report, Third Party Report and internal company assessments). These megatrends are aligned to two of our High Five strategies. See “Business–Our Strategy” for more information on our High Five program. Similar global trends and industrialization in our conventional vertical markets underpin growth prospects in a number of industries, with the services market changing due to a shift towards and higher demand for smart services. We believe that the developments in these markets have been, and will continue to be, driven in particular by further changes to the regulatory environment, such as the global ambition to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero and supporting legislative actions as well as the desire to increase the resilience of supply chains in the wake of the COVID-19 induced disruptions and political tensions. In particular in our key vertical markets, fluctuations in growth rates or growth forecasts can result in significant changes in demand for our products if our customer and end-customers in the relevant vertical market curtails their 66 ----- investment activity, for example, during economic downturns. Overall, our revenue and results of operations have been influenced, and will continue to be influenced, by secular megatrends and macroeconomic conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.2,Development of our Project Business,"A significant, and increasing, portion of our total revenue is generated from our project business, which includes construction and conversion projects and upgrades of existing facilities. KTS, our largest segment by revenue, focuses on large project business for demanding applications in High Tech, Green Tech and Conventional vertical markets such as Oil & Gas and Chemicals. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, revenue generated by KTS amounted to €294.4 million, €413.5 million and €591.9 million, respectively, or 31.6%, 38.4% and 43.9% of our total revenue for the respective years. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2023, Order Intake from KTS’ larger projects (with an order value of more than €5 million) accounted for 66% of KTS’ Order Intake with an average order size of €25.8 million and serving 11 customers globally. KTS’ high order intake level in 2023 was primarily attributable to high demand in the vertical markets Data Center (increase of approximately 80% compared to 2022) as well as Oil & Gas, Chemicals and Power & Energy (increase of approximately 139% compared to 2022), which includes the carbon capture business in North America. Profit margins are driven by product mix and timing of long-term projects. Moreover, profit margins realized on certain projects and long-term contracts can vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity during the execution of the project. Whereas the project business may be less predictable and affected by individual large projects, working capital requirements are generally lower than for the component business due to milestone payments from customers, which have significantly contributed to lower levels of trade working capital since the year ended December 31, 2021. Over time this advanced cash is reduced as projects are started and materials are purchased due to requirements for the manufacturing of the equipment. As such the cash balances is expected to normalize as cash is consumed and production executed. Cash balances can also be impacted by the timing of payments and earlier or delayed payments can have an impact. We recognize revenue from certain of our project contracts using the percentage-ofcompletion method of accounting whereby revenue and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimate of the project status and costs remaining to complete the project. Estimates of total revenue and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract, labor costs and material costs. Delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenue and margins for affected periods. The projects in which we participate can be split into several different phases of their life cycle: the bidding and development phase, the design and engineering and the production phase, and the delivery and commissioning phase. In the bidding phase, we incur costs which are not initially matched by any revenue. In the development and design and engineering phases, we typically benefit from milestone payments from our customers. As the project proceeds, cash inflows are reduced with supplier payments.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.3,Prices of raw materials and ability to increase prices and pass on cost increases,"The primary raw materials used for the manufacture of our products are steel, copper, aluminum and titanium. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our total cost of materials amounted to €604.3 million and €756.6 million, of which expenses for raw materials and supplies amounted to €564.9 million and €710.8 million, respectively. Although fluctuations in prices of raw materials and supply chain can impact our profitability, we capitalize on our ability to pass on costs to our customers. The market price and availability of these products can fluctuate sharply depending on the market situation. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant fluctuations in the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange, with a decrease of up to 20% around the outbreak and spread of the pandemic followed significant price increases in the subsequent two years. Elevated price levels of copper have since been persisting. Over the past three months, copper prices have shown some volatility but generally remained within a high range. As of early June 2024, copper was priced at approximately U.S.$9,840 per metric ton, down slightly from peaks close to U.S.$11,000 seen earlier in the year. The fluctuations are primarily due to varying industrial demand, particularly from construction and electronics sectors, along with supply disruptions affecting global markets (source: Markets Insider). Aluminum prices have experienced a steady upward trend between March and May of 2024. By the end of May 2024, aluminum was priced at approximately U.S.$2,564 per metric ton, rising from approximately U.S.$2,226 in March 2024. This increase is driven by strong demand from the automotive and aerospace industries, compounded by supply constraints from major production sources. These trends reflect the broader economic and industrial activities influencing both metals, highlighting the ongoing demand pressures and supply chain issues impacting their markets. While we currently do not use commodity derivatives as hedging instruments against price fluctuations of raw materials, we have entered into longer-term supply agreements with various suppliers in order to reduce commodity price risk. Although this does not fully shield us from the underlying commodity price risks, it provides us with balanced safeguarding mechanisms. In addition to the structure of our cost base, a primary factor affecting our margin is the absolute level of costs and our ability to manage our operating costs, are the prices that we can charge to our customers for our products. Our 67 ----- profitability is also affected by our ability to offset increasing operating costs (such as from inflation) through improvements in our production efficiency as well as our ability to pass at least some of such cost increases on to our customers. Based on our high-quality portfolio of technologically advanced products and customer-specific application services, our sales force focusing on projects and customer-specific solutions, and the strength of our Kelvion brand, we believe that we will be able to continue to agree price adjustments with customers in order to pass on increased raw material and input prices to our customers. The possibilities to pass on higher input prices to an end customer vary based on the customer and relevant market depending on the competition. In addition, we purchase a variety of intermediate products produced by other manufacturers that are integrated into the final products we provide to our end-customers. These include finished mechanical components such as fans and chiller units. Any price increases by our suppliers will result in higher costs of materials If we are not able to pass price increases on to our customers, such price increases could reduce our profit margins. See “Risk Factors—Increases in raw material prices, energy costs and prices for input materials and intermediate _products may result in higher manufacturing or purchasing costs and lower margins, and we may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers fully or at all.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The offering of our Service business varies in each legal entity to align with the respective products or specializations of the relevant manufacturing unit. However, the service offering is coordinated on a regional or segment basis for KTS. Service customers tend to be customers of our products as well as third-party products, whereby each product group’s installed base of products acts as an important driver. We believe our one-stop shop product and service offering is important to our customers and helps to drive our product sale and project business by our ability to offer services locally complementary to our local production capabilities. Compared to smaller, regionally focused competitors, we believe we have a better understanding of technical, health, safety and environmental regulation standards globally and locally, as well as the scale and logistical strength to carry out large projects which are often more profitable. Our global scale underpins the strength of our brand, which positions us well to continue to strengthen our positions across our strategic pillars and key vertical markets. Our service offering comprises our recurring component business but also more often than not is the provision of specific customer requirements. Our service portfolio consists of inhouse servicing, field service, spare parts, replacement and upgrades as well as modernization. Training and consulting is also performed where customer needs require. Our service offering is a key contributor to our revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our services revenue amounted to €259 million (19% of total revenue) compared to €215 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 (19% of total revenue). In the three months ended March 31, 2024 our services revenue amounted to €58 million (17% of total revenue).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Our application engineering expertise, production and process know-how are based on decades of experience and supported by our network of 19 engineering centers around the world. Consequently, our research and development expenses primarily relate to personnel expenses related to our network of engineering centers. Our engineers also support our sales team by advising on new projects, develop and test new product applications through our global solutions engineering team. We have an agile customer development approach by being able to pool specialists to support a customer enquiry from quote to order to delivered engineering solution. Resulting in bespoke engineering solutions with a fast turnaround. Our manufacturing technology also allows us to handle rare material requests e.g. electron beam welding, auto weld high pressure chambers or diffusion welding. Our technology teams’ approach to development projects puts the customer at the center of the program leading to a short time to market building on variations of in-house technology and expertise. Our total R&D expenses in the year ended December 31, 2023 were €16.5 million compared to €14.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and €12.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Given that these expenses are primarily driven by personnel headcount and expenses, we expect the ratio of such expenses to revenue to remain relatively low and stable. Our capital expenditures amounted to €8.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, €56.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, €34.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and €33.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2022 and 2023, we mainly invested in operations where investment was required for growth in new products and vertical markets, as well as replacement of equipment and machinery. Our ratio of capital expenditures to revenue during the three years ended December 31, 2023 was 3.7%. 68 ----- For the year ending December 31, 2024, we have budgeted approximately €45 million of capital expenditures, including for investments in manufacturing improvement, new Green Tech solutions as well as upgrades to our enterprise resource program software to SAP S/4 Hana and excluding any capital expenditures in connection with the planned EMEA production footprint alignment program.

In particular, as a result of our international operations, our cash flows are denominated (apart from euro) mainly in U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi. The cash inflows, in particular those in U.S. dollars, expose us to translation risks as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. We intend to proactively manage translation risks by following our prudent financial policy, including hedging foreign currency risks on an opportunistic basis. Due to our growth in the United States and APAC regions in recent years, the portion of our revenues and costs denominated in U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi is expected to increase. We hedge foreign currency items as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates, and limit some currency risk, mainly from sales and procurement transactions. A depreciation of other currencies against the euro means that, despite constant sales volumes and nominally constant prices, will, after translation into euro, generate lower revenue and profits for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations expose us to translation risks, as all non-euro financial results our companies must be translated into euro when preparing our consolidated financial statements.

The increase was primarily attributable to positive growth in the HVAC & Refrigeration end-markets (Data Center business as the main driver) in our two largest regions Western Europe and North America. Revenue in RT increased by €32,082 thousand, or 13.2%, from €242,458 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €274,540 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by considerable volume growth and price increases, offset, in part by an initially weaker start of the year in the Americas and ongoing supply chain challenges. Revenue in MCS increased by €36,426 thousand, or 25.5%, from €142,865 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €179,291 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Revenue in KTS increased by €119,061 thousand, or 40.4%, from €294,446 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €413,507 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly due to improving order intake throughout the second half of 2021 and 2022, mainly driven by KTS’ expanding Data Center business as well as improvement in the Oil & Gas end-markets. In 2021, revenue in KTS included non-recurring revenue of €38.7 million from an arbitration award related to a legacy power project in South Africa. 73 ----- Revenue in PHE increased by €34,861 thousand, or 16.7%, from €208,544 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €243,405 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven mainly by an increase in volumes of brazed plate heat exchangers for the booming heat pump industry as well as the expanding service business. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by €143,078 thousand, or 19.1%, from €749,088 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €892,166 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was in line with the development of sales revenue. _Selling expenses_ Selling expenses decreased by €2,691 thousand, or 3.4%, from €78,698 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2021 to €76,007 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase was mainly due to the increase in our revenue in 2022 and costs related to the carveout of KTS. _Other income_ Other income decreased by €16,941 thousand, or 37.2%, from €45,512 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €28,571 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reassessment of provisions relating to the winding down of the ACC business of ENEXIO recognized in 2021. _Other expenses_ Other expenses increased by €3,774 thousand, or 14.5%, from €26,057 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €29,831 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Our principal uses of cash are funding the daily business, working capital and capital expenditures. We expect to meet our requirements for the next twelve months primarily from cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we utilize factoring agreements to support our liquidity needs and manage our working capital. As of March 31, 2024, €27.3 million were utilized under our existing factoring agreements and €85 million were available for utilization. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Factoring Arrangements.”_ From time to time, we also enter into bilateral facilities with local lenders to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements. As of March 31, 2024, we had bilateral facilities in Brazil and, to a minor extent, in France and our liabilities under these bank loans amounted to €5.1 million. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet these needs or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs.

Cash flows from operating activities increased by €49,804 thousand from €29,796 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2021 to €79,600 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a change in provisions of €51,158 thousand, mainly driven by the settlement of a legacy project for the construction of a dry cooling solution for a power station in South Africa and the release of a provision made in 2021, which more than offset the decrease of €22,873 thousand of EBIT to €7,118 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022 from €29,991 thousand in the prior year. The increase was attributable to an increase in cash inflow of €3,977 thousand from trade working capital as well as €2,901 thousand lower tax payments. Cash flows from operating activities increased by €138,187 thousand from €79,600 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022 to €217,787 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2023.

The decrease was primarily attributable to phasing of projects spend at comparative times. Cash flows from investing activities increased by €4,859 thousand, or 17.0%, from an outflow of €28,623 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2021 to an outflow of €33,482 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the sustained high level of investment activity in 2022. Cash outflows in 2022 related to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as to intangible assets of €34,769 thousand. The proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets and assets held for sale amounted to €1,287 thousand and related to the replacement of non-material equipment. Cash flows from investing activities increased by €12,672 thousand, or 37.8%, from an outflow of €33,482 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022 to an outflow of €46,154 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2023.

The higher interest payments in 2022 related mainly to the deferral of the payment of interest on the Existing Notes in December 2021 (€14.2 million) and lower interest on the Existing L/G Facility Agreement. Cash flows from financing activities increased by €108,269 thousand from an outflow of €6,379 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022 to an outflow of €114,648 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Trade working capital w/o retention at year end 2023 primarily related to the component business driven PHE (€44.8 million) and MCS (€9.7 million). The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in RT mainly due to an increase of advance payments on projects received and a reduction in PHE mainly due to a decrease in trade receivables and in inventories. The increase in inventories was primarily due to the increase (€6.7 million) in KTS. The increase was offset, in part, the other product groups, including PHE, RT and MSC. The lower level of trade working capital w/o retention as of December 31, 2023 was driven by RT and KTS, where high advance payments were collected on major projects and which is reflected in the increase in advanced payments & contract liabilities of €234.7 million at year end 2023 (increase of €89.7 million compared to year end 2022). The increase was primarily driven by the higher activity at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022. For the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect trade working capital w/o retention to increase due to growth and expected stage of completion of larger projects. _December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021_ As of December 31, 2022, our trade working capital w/o retention amounted to €84.2 million, a decrease of €28.2 million compared to €112.4 million as of December 31, 2021. Trade working capital w/o retention at year end 2022 primarily related to the component business driven PHE (€74.0 million), RT (€19.5 million) and MCS (€17.8 million), whereas the trade working capital w/o retention of the project business-oriented KTS had negative trade working capital w/o retention (€15.3 million). The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in KTS due to high advance payments on projects received and an increase in trade receivables. The increase in inventories (€11.0 million) was primarily attributable to an increase in KTS and was offset, in part, by a decrease in PHE. The decrease in trade working capital w/o retention as of December 31, 2022 was driven by KTS, where high advance payments were collected on major projects mainly in the US, which is also reflected in the higher advance payments of €145.0 million at year end 2022 (increase of €59.3 million compared to the prior year).

These assets and liabilities are denominated in local currency. When the net asset values are converted into Euro, the currency fluctuations result in period to period changes in those net asset values. Our equity position reflects these changes in net asset values. We also have transactional currency exposures which arise mostly from sales or purchases in currencies other than the functional currency. In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations for the operating business, all companies are required to economically hedge foreign currency items, as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates. Currency risks are economically hedged for recognized assets and liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and highly probable forecasted transactions, when denominated in another currency than the functional currency of the company. The hedging periods are determined by the maturity of the economical hedged items and are usually up to twelve months, but may also exceed that period significantly in exceptional cases. Hedge accounting in the sense of IFRS 9 is not applied. All economic hedging transactions – to the extent legally permissible – are handled by our group treasury department.

In general, we have adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral in the form of advanced payments where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. We monitor the exposure and the credit ratings of our existing and potential counterparties continuously. Companies active in the component business use credit limits to assess their counterparty default risk, whereas a maximum risk limit is defined for each party. In most cases, this limit is derived from recognized credit rating agencies and credit default swaps if available. Appropriate action is taken if the individual limit is exceeded. Companies active in the project business ascertain the financial standing of potential customers on a case-by-case basis using all available financial information. Before a project order is accepted, the assessment is additionally reviewed under internal risk procedures. In the case of export transactions, confirmed and unconfirmed letters of credit are used alongside sureties, guarantees, and cover notes, including from export credit agencies. 79 ----- Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across different industries and regions. Hence, there is no concentration of risk. Valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks. Derivative financial instruments are concluded only with financial institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies so as to reduce the credit risk involved. We do not have any critical credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and also typically are our lenders. Therefore, the credit quality of financial assets which are neither past due nor impaired is assessed to be good. The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets is the carrying amount.

We manage the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities, and reserve borrowing facilities as well as by monitoring forecasted cash flows at regular intervals. The cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity. In order to optimize borrowing and the use of our cash funds, cash pools in various countries are established. The cash pools automatically balance the accounts of the participating companies every day by crediting or debiting a target account.

Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the heat exchanger industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services, current replacement costs, prices paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in circumstances, which indicate that an impairment exists. The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant judgements concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows, applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. The carrying amounts of intangible assets, items of property, plant and equipment, and groups of cash-generating units with goodwill are reviewed if they are likely to have been impaired by events or changes in circumstances. In addition, indefinite-lived intangible assets and cash-generating units with goodwill are tested for impairment at least once a year. The impairment test compares the asset’s carrying amount against its recoverable amount (“impairment test”). The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs of disposal (net realizable value). An estimate of fair value less costs to sell is only required if the value in use is less than the carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognized. In this case, the impairment loss is first deducted from the goodwill of the cash-generating unit with goodwill. Any amount exceeding goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non-current non-financial assets. Fair value less costs of disposal is generally the benchmark for measuring the impairment of product groups classified as “held for sale”. The valuations of other intangible assets, which were performed as part of the impairment test, 80 ----- are based on management assumptions. Previously recognized impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer apply, except in the case of goodwill.

As a lessee, we are required to reassess the lease term on the occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and directly affects whether it is reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise) an option included in the original contract. Both lessees and lessors revise the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period. This requires ongoing monitoring and increases financial statement volatility. Lease payments are discontinued at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readily be determined. Otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate.

We measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month (a) ECLs debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; (b) and other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, we consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on our historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information. We assume that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. At each reporting date, we assess whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: (a) significant financial difficulty of the debtor or it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in OCI.

Calculating tax liabilities requires management to make various estimates. Management believes that it has made a reasonable estimate of tax uncertainties. However, no assurance can be given that the actual outcome of these uncertainties will correspond to the estimates made. Any deviations may have an impact on the level of tax liabilities or deferred taxes in the year of the decision. When assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management judges the extent to which realization of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently likely. The question of whether the deferred tax assets can actually be realized depends on whether sufficient future taxable income can be generated against which the temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards can be offset. Management therefore analyses the times at which the deferred tax liabilities reverse, and expected future taxable income. Management forecasts whether deferred tax assets can be realized on the basis of expected future taxable income. Deferred tax assets decline if the estimate of planned taxable income decreases, tax benefits available as a result of tax strategies are reduced, or the amount or timing of future tax benefits is restricted by changes in law.

350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.33,INDUSTRY Introduction to the Heat Exchanger Industry: Heat Exchanger Types,17.33.1,,"A heat exchanger is a device used for heat transfer from one medium to another, without mixing the two media. Heat exchangers are used across a broad range of applications, including data centers, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (“HVAC”), power & energy, oil & gas, food & beverages, chemicals, transportation and heavy & light industry and other vertical markets. An important commercial feature of heat exchangers is that they typically represent only a small portion of the machinery and equipment cost but have a high-value impact as they are important in maintaining optimal temperatures for industrial processes. For example, heat exchangers prevent machines from overheating, which could result in significant and costly downtime in production processes. Heat exchangers are also vital for maintaining the reliability, efficiency, and longevity of data center operations. They ensure that servers remain cool and perform optimally. Heat exchangers typically use either a liquid medium, where water or another liquid is used to cool or heat the fluid flowing through, or air media, where air is used as the cooling or heating medium. Examples of liquid cooled heat exchangers include shell and tube heat exchangers and plate heat exchangers, while examples of air-cooled heat exchangers include air fin coolers, radiators, and condensers. Heat exchangers frequently need to operate in difficult environments, including a broad range of temperatures (from -200 °C to +900 °C) and pressures (from -1 bar to +800 bar), as well as needing to be resistant to corrosion, fouling and scaling. Because of this range of requirements, heat exchangers are technologically advanced products that require sophisticated engineering capabilities. The key parameters which differentiate heat exchangers are temperature and flow of heat, which are in turn determined by the material characteristics such as thermal conductivity, density, specific heat, fluid viscosity, fluid velocity and surface emissivity, as well as gas characteristics. From a technology perspective, there are four basic types of heat exchangers/heat removal devices: shell and tube heat exchangers, plate heat exchangers, air-cooled heat exchangers and cooling towers. _Shell and tube heat exchangers consist of a pressure vessel known as a “shell,” with a bundle of tubes inside of_ it. One fluid runs through the tubes, while another flows over the tubes within the shell, to transfer heat between the two fluids. Shell and tube heat exchangers are widely used because of the high flexibility in allowing for a broad range of pressures and temperatures. The key applications for shell and tube heat exchangers include power generation, food and beverage, waste heat recovery, desalination, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, petrochemical, and marine applications. _Plate heat exchangers consist of a frame that holds together several metal plates that are either sealed by gaskets_ or brazed or welded together. Hot and cold fluids enter the heat exchanger via separate ports, and flow in the alternate channels that are formed by a pair of plates. The key advantage offered by plate heat exchangers is that the fluids are spread out over the plates and therefore exposed to a larger surface area, which facilitates the transfer of heat. Plate heat exchangers have a wide range of applications, including Data Centers, HVAC, food and beverages, Pharmaceutical and Biotech, Dairy Industry, Chemical processing, Renewable Energy systems, industrial processes, refrigeration, oil and gas applications and district heating and cooling. In an air-cooled heat exchanger, a pressure vessel is used that cools a circulating fluid within a finned tube by forcing ambient air over the exterior of the tubes. Air-cooled heat exchangers are favored in some applications because they eliminate the need for a continuous water supply, reduce environmental impact, and provide reliable cooling in a wide range of operating conditions. They are useful in remote locations or arid regions where water resources are limited. Key applications broadly include Data Centers, Power generation, Petrochemical and Chemical Processing, Renewable Energy, HVAC, refrigeration (for food and beverages), power, oil and gas, and Marine applications. _Cooling towers are heat removal devices used to transfer unnecessary heat from process media to the atmosphere,_ using either the principle of evaporative cooling (wet cooling towers) or a closed-circuit cooling tower where there is no direct contact between the process media and cooling air (dry cooling towers). Their ability to dissipate large amounts of heat makes them a critical component in many cooling applications. Cooling towers are used for Data Centers, Renewable Energy systems, power applications and, to some extent, other process applications such as chemicals and petrochemical processing, oil and gas and district cooling systems. The choice for a particular type of heat exchanger depends on the type of application and the characteristics of the site (e.g., dry cooling is particularly relevant in arid areas, where water is scarce) and has a direct impact on the operational cost of the application. While shell and tube exchangers currently represent the largest product segment in the global market for heat exchangers and are popular owing to their flexibility and application in a wide range of environments characterized by different pressures and temperatures, the segment for plate heat exchangers is presently growing rapidly, in part because of energy efficiency concerns. 83 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The strong growth in data centers is driven by several key factors such as: (1) the emergence and popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) based applications, (2) increased demand of cloud storage, (3) remote working and distant learning, (4) rise of data intensive technologies like machine learning (ML), internet of things (IoT) and (5) increasing digitalization of businesses and processes. This has led to a need for advanced processors that have high heat dissipation and require more power which in turn has resulted in a shift away from the traditional data center architecture to the adoption of advanced, more efficient cooling solutions such as adiabatic cooling, immersion cooling, economizer, or free cooling. Technology company’s increased investment in data centers is driving the construction and development of hyperscale data centers globally. While, at the same time, global data protection regimes are driving the development of local data center clusters, leading to regional data center demands. _Heat recovery for new living quarters_ Heat exchangers play a crucial role in HVAC systems by transferring heat between two or more fluids, typically air and a refrigerant, without mixing them. In the developed economies such as Europe and USA, strong regulatory initiatives requiring clean energy equipment to replace fossil fuel boilers in new buildings are driving demand for HVAC / heat pumps. In emerging economies, growing population, raising levels of disposable income, and increasing living standards coupled with global surface temperature rises in tandem with greenhouse gas concentrations are giving rise to increasing demand to preserve an ambient environment in a building, leading to growing demand for HVAC systems. _Increasing environmental awareness_ With the growing push for energy transition, several new industries are emerging out of the traditional industrial applications such as renewable energy, hydrogen economy, fuel cells, carbon capture utilization and storage (“CCUS”), among others. The global energy transition market is expected to grow driven by increasing regulatory standards, environmental awareness, and continuous investments to shift the energy mix to more sustainable options. Heat exchangers 84 ----- play a crucial role in power plants across the value chain in maintaining optimum operating conditions from generation to storage to distribution. By 2030, cumulative investments in energy are expected to reach U.S.$44 trillion, of which, 80% i.e., U.S.$35 trillion will be towards transition technologies prioritizing efficiency, electrification, grid expansion and flexibility (source: IRENA March 2023). _Industrialization worldwide_ In the post-pandemic world, industrial development is increasingly shaped by digitalization and automation of industrial production, a shift of global economic towards Asia and efforts to make industrial production more sustainable. Energy-efficient equipment in energy-intensive vertical markets such as chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers, food and beverages processing plants, the oil and gas industry and the marine industry are key drivers for demand for heat exchangers. New, energy-saving applications for heat exchangers, such as waste heat recovery systems, have become increasingly important. The requirement by end-customers for products that reduce costs and limit environmental emissions necessitates technological improvements. _Shift towards intelligent service_ The shift towards intelligent services for heat exchanger applications refers to the integration of advanced technologies and digital solutions to enhance the monitoring, maintenance and overall performance of heat exchangers. This includes remote monitoring and diagnostics, predictive maintenance, condition-based monitoring, remote control and optimization, digital twin technology, integration with enterprise systems. The aim is to leverage digitalization and automation technologies to enhance operational efficiency, reliability, and sustainability while reducing the lifecycle costs and enhancing customer value.

350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.37,Heat Exchanger Demand in Key Strategic Pillars,17.37.2,Green Tech,"The Green Tech sector is defined as comprising of HVAC, Carbon Capture Storage (CCS), Hydrogen economy and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). This sector focuses on those application practices, processes and products aimed at minimizing environmental impact and promoting conservation of resources. It encompasses a wider range of technologies and solutions that strive to directly or indirectly address environmental challenges such as climate change, pollution, resource depletion and ecosystem degradation. _HVAC & Refrigeration_ The HVAC industry is growing, driven by rapid expansion in commercial and residential building development projects and purchases, worldwide. In developing economies, increasing urbanization and industrialization have created demand for more HVAC-equipped enterprises and residential complexes. Energy efficiency is now required for new HVAC installations. Governments globally have implemented legislation to encourage the use of HVAC systems that satisfy industry standards for energy efficiency. The global heat exchanger demand from HVAC and refrigeration applications is expected to grow at CAGR of 5.9% from 2022 to 2027 as per the Frost & Sullivan Report. 86 ----- _Carbon Capture Storage (CCS)_ CCS is an engineered system of technologies, refined over several decades, in the process of mitigating CO2 emissions from large point sources such as power plants, refineries and other industrial facilities, or the removal of existing CO2 from the atmosphere. Captive markets, where the producer of CO2 is also the consumer, such as in chemical production or natural gas processing for enhanced oil recovery, account for the majority of global carbon capture activity. The United States are the largest CCS market followed by Europe and APAC. Carbon capture is an increasing focus for all companies to leverage their competitive advantage in an emerging industry. Heat exchangers are essential in CCS processes for their role in energy efficiency, thermal processing, thereby reducing operational costs, and also forms a significant part of the investment in CCS projects. _Hydrogen economy_ Hydrogen economy is an umbrella term used to denote hydrogen’s role alongside low-carbon electricity to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. It represents a significant growth market with diverse applications across various sectors such as heavy industry, long-haul transport, and long-term energy storage. This diversity of applications provides a wide range of opportunities. Currently, most hydrogen is produced from natural gas. Investment in technologies for producing green hydrogen (from renewable energy sources) and blue hydrogen (from natural gas with carbon capture and storage) could yield significant returns as these technologies mature and scale up. The growth of the hydrogen economy is driven by growing demand for cleaner fuel, coupled with increasing governmental regulations for desulphurization of petroleum products. Heat exchangers are an essential part of hydrogen generation as the technology / electrolysis process of generation of hydrogen is an exothermal process. Plate Heat Exchangers and Air Fin Coolers are typically used for this purpose. _Liquified Natural Gas (LNG)_ LNG is natural gas that has been cooled down to -162 °C to transform it into a liquid, making it easier and safer to transport. Natural gas primarily is methane and, when burned, releases water vapor and CO2. With emissions at 30-50% less than from other combustible sources, natural gas is regarded as the cleanest of the fossil fuels. LNG is considered as bridge fuel which can make energy transition easier. Fuel switching, primarily from fossil to LNG can reduce CO2 emissions and air pollutions. In the backdrop of recent geo-political situation and Europe’s quest to reduce dependency on Russian gas supply, LNG prices have risen sharply. Increased prices spurred a high level of new supply expected from 2024 to 2028. 193 million tons per annum nameplate capacity is expected to be added by 2028, which would represent 40% of the current capacity, implying 9% CAGR supply growth between 2024 and 2028. (source: IEEFA Report). Heat exchangers are used along the whole value chain of LNG starting from extraction, treatment, liquification, transportation, regasification and end use (power generation, gas boilers, hydrogen production).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.40,Our Strengths,17.40.5,High revenue visibility from strong Order Intake and Order Backlog development,"Our Order Intake and Order Backlog provide us with high revenue visibility, and we believe the strong development in our Order Intake and Order Backlog will support our future performance and continued growth. From 2021 to 2023, Order Intake increased at a CAGR of approximately 24%, from €1,099 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €1,698 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 and Order Backlog increased from €615 million as of December 31, 2021 to €1,103 million as of December 31, 2023. Over the same period, our revenue increased from €931.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €1,347.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a consistent ratio of Order Intake to revenue of more than 1.0x (“book-to-bill ratio”) across the periods. Moreover, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our book-to-bill-ratio amounted to 1.1x. Revenue visibility is further enhanced by the fact that, historically, a majority of our Order Intake in any given year was converted into revenue in the same fiscal year or the next succeeding year. The portion of our Order Intake in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 that was or is planned to be converted into revenue in the same year or the next succeeding year represented 51% and 54% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2023 as well as 62% of our budgeted revenue for the year ending December 31, 2024. We believe that our high revenue visibility also helps drive our profitability as it allows for improved management of customer order fulfilment, efficient operations planning and hence limits impacts under absorption. Our diversified presence across geographic regions and vertical markets enables us to benefit from increasing demand in specific regions and vertical markets without being overly dependent on any single region or vertical market. Order Intake for the year ended December 31, 2023, included €860 million in KTS, €388 million in RT, €258 million in PHE and €210 million in MCS, driven to a significant extent by strong growth in KTS. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, Order Intake was led by High Tech, followed by Conventional and with Green Tech and Service broadly equal. Americas and EMEA dominated the regions and APAC has been steadily growing. 93 ----- The increase in Order Intake has been driven primarily by high demand for data center applications (particularly in the United States due to hyperscalers) and HVAC applications (driven by catch-up in China). The growth has also been attributable to large projects, including a carbon capture project in North America (approximately U.S. $118 million in contract value) and an Oil & Gas project in Brazil (approximately U.S.$ 62 million in contract value).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In addition, beginning in 2022, we initiated a range of actions and measures to systematically improve our cash position by focusing on working capital. These included, among others, regular forecasting and active monitoring of cash management and cash conversion cycles, enhancements of enterprise resource planning systems to better track inventory levels and reduce slow-moving materials as well as actively managing receivables through initiating standard customer debt collection policies. As a result, we reduced trade working capital w/o retention from 12.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 1.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Over the same period, we managed to increase our Free Cash Flow Conversion rate from 57.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 61.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Over the last three years, we have set several measures to improve our operational efficiency (e.g. quality cost improvements from inward quality review and improvements in internal processes) and commercial efficiency. Our commercial efficiency focuses on the core areas (i) target selling (e.g. focus on vertical markets), (ii) process simplification (e.g. sales order review) and (iii) digitalization.

The primary raw materials used for the manufacture of our products are steel, copper, aluminum and titanium. We typically seek to have multiple suppliers (usually two or three) for key materials and components and believe that we are not dependent on any single supplier. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest suppliers by supplier spend represented approximately 28% of our total supplier spend. Our procurement department function is embedded within our supply chain management (“SCM”) organization. It is managed centrally in line with our overarching strategy and operates at the regional/entity level, reflecting our global matrix organization. This approach is supported by a commodity management model spanning our entire SCM organization, with a view to standardizing our collaborations with suppliers while enabling us to benefit from the opportunities of a global supply base, for example through pooling purchasing volumes, expertise and technical knowledge. With the exception of the individual specific procurement contracts between individual Group companies and with their respective suppliers, we coordinate the strategic procurement for our operational product groups centrally in order to increase our purchasing power. The most important material groups are managed by a designated commodity manager and representatives of such Group companies for which the commodity is particularly relevant. The main task of this commodity team is to develop and implement commodity-specific procurement strategies. The team negotiates prices and volumes with selected suppliers in accordance with the chosen procurement strategy. In addition, local purchasing employees support our commodity teams by managing the relationship with our key suppliers. Given the increasing focus on sustainability considerations at the global level, on the one hand, and the broad array of materials we procure and the number of suppliers we have from various countries, on the other hand, our SCM function faces challenges in its efforts to harmonize systems and processes that reflect both global and local/regional ESG requirements. In order to manage these challenges, we have defined ESG requirements for our suppliers on the basis of the UN Global Compact and supplemented these with country-specific elements. The verification and validation of our suppliers’ ESG performance is conducted by means of an ESG supply chain compliance (“request for information”) questionnaire (the “ESG Supply Chain Compliance Questionnaire”) which is shared with relevant suppliers on at least an annual basis. The number of suppliers involved in the most recent ESG Supply Chain Compliance Questionnaire amounted to approximately 630 and included suppliers for both direct and indirect materials and services.

It also enables the front-end Sales teams to expand our product offering as needed to address regional “white spots” (i.e., markets in which we do not yet have a sufficient presence). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have approximately 650 employees working in sales related functions. Our Global Solutions Engineering teams, with their industry-specific focus, serve to continuously optimize business processes such as key account coordination, technical process development and project support, thereby acting as a bridge between the product groups and our sales teams. Our RT, MCS, PHE and KTS are responsible for manufacturing and product line management (for example, charge air coolers and radiators) and for implementing the reorganization of the manufacturing footprint through Group oversight, as well as targeting cost and lead time reductions through the consolidation, standardization and modularization of our numerous product lines. In close cooperation with the Front-End Sales and Global Solutions Engineering teams, the product areas are also driving the development of innovative products to address future market demand.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

With our waste reduction program and continuous reduction of our CO2 footprint through innovation and the use of smart technologies, we intend to meet our customer expectations of high quality and resource-efficient production and supply chain management, and to be carbon neutral by 2040. In line with our strategy, we could achieve for 2023 an increase in the consumption of energy from renewable sources, a reduction in our direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and a reduction in the disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. _CO2 Footprint_ Our environmental focus is also demonstrated by our use of green energy and our energy-saving endeavors at our plants: Since our production plant in Wuhu (China) was established in 1995, it has bundled our core competences – robust production capabilities, extensive service offerings and deep technical expertise, backed up by the innovative strength of our local R&D departments – to supply heat exchanger solutions to customers around the globe. The first solar panels were installed in Wuhu in 2022 and the entire roof of the production facility is equipped with solar panels, substantially reducing our CO2 emissions with more than 4.0 MW of green electricity generated. We believe that this initiative constitutes a strong first step towards achieving our goal of 100% usage of green energy. Our production site in Sint Maartensdijk, the Netherlands, halved its energy consumption, reducing CO2 emissions from approximately 1,000 tons per year to approximately 500 tons per year, between 2021 and 2023. This was primarily attributable to significantly lower electricity usage achieved through the implementation of a range of energy-saving measures, such as reduction of the start-up time of machines prior to working hours, checks to ensure that machines are not automatically switched on by timers or software at the weekends, remote measurement of individual appliances and heating and ongoing campaigns to raise awareness among employees of energy-saving behavior among all colleagues, including regular communication and postings on information displays, as well as an ideas box. As a next step, we are expanding our focus to include waste heat recovery: In addition to implementing internal measures in this regard, we are also collaborating with a network of local companies, as well as the city administration, to explore and implement further ideas for more sustainable production. We are working with an industrial company on a project to reduce our CO2 emissions by recovering waste heat for use in heating the production halls for our air cooler units. While our low-temperature factory heating system is already sustainable, the use of waste heat from neighboring facilities opportunistically will reduce our natural gas requirements and thereby enable us to reduce our carbon footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

As a matter of principle, we have a policy not to buy any materials that are associated with the exploitation of people or with child labor, and also expect our business customers to observe these standards. We are committed to providing a safe, healthy and also inspiring working environment with fair and respectful working conditions for all members of our workforce. We continue to pursue our zero-accident strategy to eliminate the number of accidents and ensure safe conditions and practices at our facilities. We fundamentally uphold diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) principles in all areas of our global operations and condemn discrimination of all kinds. These core principles are a fixed and integral part of our HR policy, and are reflected in numerous corresponding programs worldwide, such as health and safety at work initiatives and our Whistleblower Policy. 100 ----- _Safety_ We develop innovative, high-quality products and processes for our customers, and product safety is a top priority in our business operations. Our Safety Topic of the Month (“STM”) initiative relates to a monthly publication aimed at raising awareness among our workforce of one of a broad range of safety topics, which are of particular relevance for the employees at our production and service facilities. The STM material is published on our intranet and on blackboards on every production site worldwide. Each STM focuses on a specific risk and provides clear instructions for the action to be taken to reduce said risk. In addition, a safety and risk minimization checklist is made available to those responsible for occupational health and safety matters on site. As part of our Health, Safety & Environment (“HSE”) program, we have defined a global baseline with a view to improving health and safety management at all of our production sites. This involves the completion of a self-assessment questionnaire for each of our facilities based on seven categories, such as targets, qualifications and risk assessment, with 10-15 questions each. On the basis of the scores for 2023, the following steps were identified for 2024: (i) Connection of lower scoring sites with the high scoring sites for the categories in question; (ii) setting up internal calls for the discussion of the specific issues; and (iii) preparation of a cross-check audits, pursuant to which the HSE Manager for one production facility will conduct an audit of another production facility. This should help cross learning, help create standardization and drive performance improvement. The implementation of the steps identified each year for the following year ensures continual improvements in the scores achieved by our facilities and promotes the maintenance of a robust health and safety culture globally: It encourages our employees to take responsibility for their own safety and that of their colleagues, to strive to attain and follow up on HSE goals and targets, and to complete HSE qualifications and training (for staff and supervisors). It also facilitates the identification of (occupational) HSE risks, and encourages the carrying out of regular inspections by those responsible for health & safety at our production sites and also investigations into near misses and actual accidents, including root cause analyses and risk assessment reviews. We have adopted a similar approach in the areas of quality and environment. _Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)_ DEI are core values within our organization. It is our goal to have a diverse and talented workforce that also reflects the diversity of our stakeholders and business partners. We are committed to maintaining a diverse, equal and inclusive corporate culture, continually implementing corresponding improvements in all of our human resources processes to provide a working environment which is free of prejudice and in which everyone is treated equally, and to attract and retain top talent and foster greater innovation, creativity and, at the same time, productivity. Our DEI policy sets out our aims and commitments in this area and several initiatives are underway to increase understanding and awareness within our organization: Further examination of our existing human resources processes, in particular recruitment and talent management, to attract more women and individuals from diverse backgrounds to our company, mentoring and “bonding” programs for our female employees to foster networking activity and support their professional development, for example our K°Women’s Network and a new women-focused mentoring program launched in February 2024, and DEI training for employees and management.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

We believe that our relationships with our employees are generally good. We have not suffered any material work stoppages or strikes in recent years. Certain of our employees are represented by works councils. Works councils have various information, consultation and co-determination rights. For example, they must be notified in advance of any employee layoffs, must consent to hirings and relocations of employees and are granted co-determination rights in social matters, such as work schedules and rules of conduct. In addition, we are subject to collective bargaining agreements with employees in various countries, including Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands. 101 ----- _Pension Liabilities_ Our employees are offered various benefit options, primarily in the form of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The defined benefit pension plan obligations mainly exist in Germany. New employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions. As part of the general benefits provided, all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their compensation. Under this arrangement, an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of up to 100% of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit. A corresponding collective bargaining agreement was entered by our predecessors in 2002 and revised in 2008. The new pension plan beginning in January 2019 does not only provide for pension payments, but also capital payments and installment payments. In addition to the currently open benefit schemes, there are a number of historical pension schemes. These schemes are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for employees who were members at the time the benefit scheme was closed. As of December 31, 2023, the net carrying amount of defined benefit obligations amounted to €25,416 thousand (as of December 31, 2022: €23,439 thousand).

We do not expect that any of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in connection with the financial restructuring and recapitalization of Galapagos Holding S.A. and Galapagos S.A. in 2019, a number of claims were filed against our entities in various jurisdictions. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, such claims either have been dismissed or decided in our favor in final and unappealable judgements or have been irrevocably withdrawn. On October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. acquired the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Galapagos BidCo Group”). Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., was the shareholder of Kelvion Finance GmbH, (together with its subsidiaries, the “Kelvion Group”) and in ENEXIO Management GmbH (together with its subsidiaries, the “ENEXIO Group”) at the acquisition date. The acquisition was consummated by way of a distressed disposal under an English law governed intercreditor agreement dated May 14, 2014 (the “2014 Intercreditor Agreement”) in connection with the balance sheet restructuring transaction of Galapagos S.A. and Galapagos Holding S.A., the former direct and indirect shareholders of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., which resulted in a recapitalization of the operating business of the Galapagos BidCo Group, a deleveraging of the Galapagos BidCo Group’s balance sheet and access to new debt facilities and instruments with longer tenors (the “Recapitalization”). In connection with the Recapitalization, the Issuer in particular issued the Existing Notes. In connection with the Recapitalization, a holder of senior unsecured notes issued by Galapagos Holdings S.A. in 2014 (the “2014 Senior Unsecured Notes”), which had been impaired as part of the Recapitalization, filed claims against Galapagos Holdings S.A., Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and certain Group entities in the courts of the State of New York. The relevant holder of the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes asserted, among other things, that the sale of the Galapagos BidCo Group violated the terms of the indenture governing the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2014 Intercreditor Agreement and that the release of certain guarantees under the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes were invalid. In response, Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., among other things, sought certain declaratory judgments in the English courts (which are the competent courts for the interpretation of the 2014 Intercreditor Agreement), confirming that the sale of the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. complied with the terms of the 2014 Intercreditor Agreement. In July 2023, the competent English courts granted the declaratory judgments sought by Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. Following this decision, the relevant holder of the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes agreed to a dismissal of the claims filed in the courts of the State of New York and the relevant proceedings are closed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, insolvency proceedings over Galapagos S.A. were opened in 2019 and are pending in Düsseldorf, Germany and London, United Kingdom in connection with the Recapitalization. The German insolvency administrator filed a number of claims before German and Luxembourg courts seeking to prevent and/or unwind the transfer of the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. on the basis that such transfer constituted a voidable action and was fraudulent. The German clawback proceedings were finally dismissed in June 2023 and the relevant proceedings are closed. In January 2024, the German insolvency administrator also withdrew the corresponding proceedings in Luxembourg and the case is closed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

In particular, our operations are subject to laws and regulations designed to limit emissions. In Germany, the construction and operation of production sites requires active permits under the Federal Emissions Protection Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, the “BimSchG”), which encompasses various other licenses, authorizations and approvals necessary for the construction and operation of facilities pursuant to other laws. The permits typically provide for a variety of auxiliary conditions aimed at protection of other interests, such as neighbors and the environment. As part of our obligations under the BImSchG and supplementing laws, regulations and standards, we are required to observe the emission standards set under the Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control (Technische Anleitung Luft – the “TA Luft”), a revised version of which entered into force on December 1, 2021. In general, to the extent the respective facility operated in compliance with its legally definitive permits and applicable laws and regulations, the operation of the facility can generally not be challenged or contested by third parties. However, proportionate measures to mitigate any negative impact of a facility on the environment or neighbors may be required; including, _e.g., adherence to stricter emissions thresholds. For instance, permits may be amended and administrative orders under the BimSchG may impose certain limitations (e.g., stricter requirements with regard to permissible emissions or the use of the relevant facilities), with which we have to comply. To the extent certain measures based on state-of-the-art technology are impossible or economically disproportionate to implement in light of extraordinary costs, the regulator may grant certain privileges to the relevant facility (e.g., less strict emission thresholds than expected with state-of-the-art technology). To the extent new legal standards are introduced, permits are dynamic and will, in general, be adjusted so they meet the relevant new standards. Non-compliance of the operator with applicable permits, other administrative decisions, laws, regulations or standards may also lead to a (temporary) restriction or, in severe cases, a prohibition of further operation. The competent authority may also impose administrative fines or, in exceptional cases, even ask for removal of the facility. Furthermore, non-compliance may result in additional administrative, civil or even criminal liability as well as reputational damage, depending on the individual case.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Environmental Laws,58.1.2,Carbon Emissions,"The EU ETS imposes an EU-wide emissions cap applying to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by in-scope operations and provides for the trade with allowances for such emissions for certain sectors and companies. The EU ETS was implemented in Germany with the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz, the “TEHG”). The provisions of the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act provide that the facility operators subject to emissions trading are obliged to obtain a license to emit greenhouse gases, to comply with a cap on emission allowances allocated to them and to maintain a monitoring process to determine and documents their emissions. For newer facilities, this permit is typically integrated into the BImSchG permit. The regulations also provide for the possibility of trading surplus allowances on the open market. The allowances are traded in certain trading periods, which requires certain energy and industry sectors to comply with the applicable greenhouse gas emissions caps. Overall, only a limited number of allowances—determined in advance for the trading period—are available to emission sources, subject to the EU ETS. Participation in this system has been mandatory since 2005 for all industries with high energy consumption levels. The overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been constantly reduced over the different trading periods. Under the revised EU ETS, the EU-wide quantity of emission allowances allocated annually is reduced by a linear factor of 4.3% per year from 2024 compared to the average annual total quantity of emission allowances 104 ----- issued in the EU between 2008 and 2012 (which equals an annual reduction of 87,924,231 allowances to be issued in the EU) and of 4.4% as from 2028 (or 89,968,981 per year). To achieve the target of cutting EU emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality within the EU by 2050, a further reduction of 90 million allowances in 2024 and further 27 million allowances in 2026 will be made in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 2021/1119 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality (the “European Climate Law”). Based on this reduction path, the total quantity of newly issued allowances will be zero in 2040. Until then, the transitional free allocation of allowances will continue on a reduced rate. On June 5, 2023, the Directive 2023/959/EU amending the Emissions Trading Directive 2003/87/EC (the “Emissions Trading Directive”) entered into force. According to the amended version of the Emissions Trading Directive, the free allocation will be reduced to 0% until 2030 for most sectors, except for district heating, which will continue to receive a free allocation of 30%. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission allowances will have to purchase a considerable and steadily increasing proportion of increasingly pricy emission allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial additional cost for such companies. A further exemption is available for certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation of plants to countries with less stringent climate protection laws (“Carbon Leakage”). Since 2010, the European Commission determines every five years which industries are threatened by Carbon Leakage. The designated industries are allocated 100% emission allowances free of charge for the period until 2030. However, the allocation of 100% does not necessarily mean that the allocation is in line with the demand. The product benchmarks, which determine the amount of allowances allocated free of charge, are based on the average performance of the 10% most efficient facilities in a sector or subsector in the Union and will decline by 0.3 to 2.5% per year, calculated from the year 2008, taking into account expected emission reductions due to technological progress. Some of the Carbon Leakage industry sectors may apply for financial compensation for the increase of electricity costs due to the costs of EU ETS allowances being passed on to electricity prices. The compensation is not enforceable and is granted from funds provided in the federal budget for that purpose for the relevant year.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

REACH aims to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, including the promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of substances, as well as free movement of substances on the internal market while promoting competitiveness and innovation. REACH standardizes chemicals legislation within Europe, placing greater responsibility on industry participants – encompassing manufacturers, importers, downstream users and distributors – making them responsible for the safety of the substances, mixtures and articles placed on the market of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) for industrial, professional and consumer use. REACH sets out general rules for the marketing of substances, mixtures and articles in the EEA, and imposes various obligations which vary according to the hazardous properties of the substances, their form, quantity and concentration, as well as the role of the actors in the supply chain. Applicable obligations may include, e.g., the duty to register substances, notify substances in articles to the European Chemicals Agency (the “ECHA”), duty to communicate information in the supply chain and down to the customers, duty to comply with restrictions and/or authorization requirements. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of the German Chemicals Act (Gesetz zum Schutz vor gefährlichen _Stoffen—Chemikaliengesetz, the “ChemG”) and related ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen), most notably the Hazardous_ Substances Regulation (Gefahrstoffverordnung). The ChemG and supplementing regulations are intended to minimize the risks from chemicals for humans and the environment.

There is no predetermined statutory order in which the aforementioned parties can be required by the competent authority to carry out remediation measures. When exercising its discretion, the competent authority takes into account the effectiveness of remediation as a prevailing factor. Thus, the current owner of the contaminated property will generally be held primarily liable, as he is usually in the best position to carry out the necessary remediation work. However, the party that carried out the remediation work may be able to claim compensation from the other responsible parties irrespective of which party is held liable by the competent local authority. Unless otherwise agreed upon, the obligation to provide compensation under the BbodSchG, as well as the extent of such compensation, depends on the degree to which the hazard or damage was primarily attributable to one party or the other. Liability is not based on culpability. Therefore, the BbodSchG does not require the competent authority to prove negligence or intent on the part of the liable parties. According to the BbodSchG the competent authority may require risk inspections, investigations, remedial measures, including clean-up or containment, and other measures necessary for the protection of the soil and the prevention of residual contamination or other harmful soil changes and related (ground)water contamination. Regarding other environmental media, _e.g., (ground)water or protected natural resources, other laws, such as, _inter alia, the Federal Water Management Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, the “WHG”) and the Environmental Damage Act_ (Umweltschadensgesetz, the “UschadG”) provide for further contamination-related liability of, in particular, polluters and facility operators.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In the EU, product regulations such as Regulation (EU) No 2023/1230 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2023 (the “EU Machinery Regulation”) and Directive 2014/68/EU (the “EU Pressure Equipment",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,"Directive”), which provides for strict obligations with regard to product traceability, are relevant for our product portfolio.",58.3.1,,"These Directives provide the regulatory basis for the harmonization of the essential health and safety requirements for machinery and pressure equipment at EU level. As a manufacturer of heat exchangers, we must implement a conformity assessment procedure to ensure compliance with those requirements, issue a declaration of conformity and affix the CE marketing on the products. The EU Pressure Equipment Directive was implemented into German law by the Product Safety Act (Produktsicherheitsgesetz, the “ProdSG”), which regulates the safety requirements for products brought to the German market to ensure they do not present a risk to health and safety when properly installed, maintained, and used as intended. Further, Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2012 on eco-design requirements for air conditioners and comfort fans and Commission Regulation (EU) No 327/2011 of March 30, 2011 with regard to eco-design requirements for fans driven by motors with an electric input power between 125 W and 500 kW apply for our products. As we are distributors of these products our customers expect compliance with eco-design requirements as with any other applicable regulation. Under these Regulations related to eco-design, air conditioners must, _e.g., comply with requirements related to energy efficiency and sound power. As we manufacture and distribute heat exchangers containing substances depleting the ozone layer we must further comply with the respective legislation. In the EU, for instance, Regulation (EU) 2024/590 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 February 2024, provides for a gradual phase out of hydro-chloro-fluor-carbons (HCFC), which are, inter alia, used in air conditioning equipment. In addition, the use of certain fluorinated greenhouse gases in air conditioning systems of motor vehicles is gradually prohibited through Directive 2006/40/EC of May 17, 2006. Similar restrictions may apply outside the EU in the United States implementing the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer of September 16, 1987, as amended. Compliance with product regulations is enforced by the authorities on a random sample basis, whistleblowing or notifications of competitors. The authorities may investigate the facts and issue orders, in a worst case scenario sales bans, corrective actions and product recalls.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In the EU, for example, Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985, as amended by Directive 1999/34/EC of May 10, 1999 (the “Product Liability Directive”) applies to movables which have been industrially produced. It establishes the principle of objective liability (liability without fault of the producer) in cases of damage caused by a defective product. The Directive applies to damage caused by death or by personal injuries and damage to an item of property intended for private use or consumption, with a lower threshold of €500. The Product Liability Directive imposes no financial cap on a producer’s liability, yet it allows EU member states to cap a producer’s liability for damages from death or personal injury caused by identical items with the same defect at no less 106 ----- than €70 million. Furthermore, the Product Liability Directive does not bar EU member states from offering injured parties more comprehensive or extra rights under contractual or non-contractual liability grounds. In September 2022, the European Commission published a draft proposal to update the Product Liability Directive. This revision aims to modernize the regulations governing product liability for the digital era, create equal conditions for manufacturers inside and outside the EU, and enhance consumer protection by easing the proof required in liability claims. After preliminary discussions on this proposal, a compromised draft was agreed upon on January 24, 2024. The European Parliament officially approved the updated Product Liability Directive in March 2024. Its formal ratification by the European Council, announcement in the Official Journal of the European Union, and subsequent implementation are anticipated in the first half of 2024. Once in effect, member states will have 24 months to incorporate the revised directive into their national laws. However, the new Product Liability Directive does not allow any derogations in order to achieve a higher or lower level of protection.

In general, compliance with employment safety regulations is subject to regulatory supervision. We ensure compliance with the applicable legal requirements to protect health and safety for humans involved in our operations.

350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,58,REGULATION,58.6,Data Privacy,58.6.1,,"We are subject to laws across several jurisdictions regarding privacy and protection of personal data. Laws and regulations related to data protection, privacy, cyber-security and other laws and regulations can be very stringent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These laws govern how companies collect, process, and share personal data, grant rights to data subjects, and require that companies implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. In the European Union and the EEA, the principles on the legitimate processing of personal data are laid down in the GDPR as well as national legislation supplementing the GDPR (such as the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, the “BDSG”). Personal data is defined broadly and includes any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject). The GDPR implements stringent requirements obligations and restrictions for, among other things, the collection, storage, transfer and other processing of personal data, in particular (without limitation) for lawful processing, transparency, data subject rights, international data transfers, storage limitation, data mapping and accountability, processor (service provider) obligations, joint controllership, notification of data breaches and the requirement to designate a data protection officer. The collection of personal data is confined strictly to specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and the processing of this data must be in alignment with these purposes. Furthermore, personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to the purposes for which it is processed (principle of data minimization). The processing must be carried out in a way that guarantees transparency, fairness, and appropriate security of the personal data. As a consequence, the GDPR requires us to inform data subjects regarding, among others, the manner in which their personal data is collected, utilized, and processed, the legal justification for its processing, and the entities with which their personal data is shared. In addition, the GDPR and local data protection rules provide strict requirements on the processing of sensitive personal data (so-called special categories of personal data), like genetic and health data of individuals, including on the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security of this data. Accordingly, certain cyber-security requirements must be fulfilled to ensure that data is processed and stored safely. We are required to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the organization’s processing requirements and risk. Organizations must notify the relevant supervisory authority about data breaches within certain time limits and, in some instances, provide notification to data subjects. 107 ----- In general, the transfer of personal data to third counties or international organizations outside the EU/EEA is permitted only when certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection. In relation to data transfers from the EU/EEA to the United States, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-US Privacy Shield in July 2023 to facilitate EU-US data transfers. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. The GDPR and the BDSG introduced substantial sanctions for non-compliance and, depending on the nature of the infringed provision, may consist of civil liabilities, cease-and-desist orders from competitors, criminal sanctions and/or administrative fines, and adverse publicity and reputational damages. Administrative fines can amount to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual sales of the preceding year, whichever is higher, for each violation. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to evolving EU and national privacy laws on the use of cookies, tracking technologies and emarketing practices. In the EU, informed consent is required for the placement of certain cookies that are not technically essential for use or similar tracking technologies on an individual’s device and for direct electronic marketing. Consent is tightly defined and includes a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to obtain separate consents for each type of cookie or similar technology. In Germany, the use of internet tracking technologies is regulated in the German Telecommunications Digital Services Data Protection Act (Telekommunikation-Digitale-Dienste-Datenschutz-Gesetz, the “TDDDG”) which implements Directive 2002/58/EC (the “ePrivacy Directive”) and applies in addition to the requirements under the GDPR. Furthermore, based on the EU and German Data and Digital Strategies, there are several initiatives pending and new laws passed aimed at establishing a single, uniform digital European market with robust cyber-security requirements, including the Digital Services Act, the Data Act, the Directive EU 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities (so-called NIS2 Directive), and the Cyber Resilience Act.

Since January 2024, the LkSG obligates companies with a workforce of, in principle, at least 1,000 employees in Germany that have their headquarters, main administration, administrative headquarters, legal domicile, or a branch in Germany to ensure that the canon of protected human rights and environmental obligations set out in the law are not infringed and that corresponding risks are minimized and mitigated, both in their own business areas and in their wider supply chain. The protected legal positions under the LkSG include, in particular, protection from child and forced labor, slavery, disregard of occupational safety obligations and freedom of association, protection from discrimination and withholding of adequate wages, protection from certain environmental pollutions, as well as land expropriation, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Companies must also consider environmental obligations from a set of three internationally recognized agreements, namely the Minamata Convention, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and the Basel Convention. The specific content of the statutorily required systemic and dynamic corporate risk management depends on a variety of factors, such as the nature and scope of the business (including the risks of the specific industry and business and the type of products), as well as the company’s ability to influence the immediate cause. All supply chain due diligence risk management is required to be on-going, as it should be carried out and/or its effectiveness reviewed annually as well as on an ad hoc basis if the in-scope company has reason to expect a significantly changed or significantly expanded risk situation in the supply chain, e.g., due to the introduction of new products, projects or new business fields, or information received through the complaints procedure/grievance mechanism. Enforcement rests with a federal authority, the BAFA, and may be initiated ex officio or by individual application of an affected party. Should enterprises not adhere to their legal responsibilities, they could face administrative penalties. These penalties can reach up to 2% of the enterprise’s yearly worldwide turnover. The system of fines based on revenue is specifically applicable to enterprises generating over €400 million in annual revenue. Additionally, enterprises might be disqualified from receiving public contracts if they are subjected to an administrative fine that exceeds a specified minimum threshold. 108 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The EU Parliament adopted the CSDDD on April 24, 2024 and the Council of the EU formally adopted the CSDDD on May 24, 2024. The CSDDD still needs to be transposed into national law. The CSDDD will affect companies of more than 1,000 employees with a turnover of more than EUR 450 million. It aims to foster sustainable and responsible corporate behavior in companies’ operations and across their global value chains. To this end, the directive establishes a corporate due diligence duty for companies, requiring them to identify, prevent, mitigate, address, and account for potential and actual adverse human rights and the environment impacts in the company’s own operations, their subsidiaries and, where related to their value chain(s), those of their business partners. Additionally, the CSDDD obligates large companies to adopt and put into effect, through best efforts, a transition plan for climate change mitigation aligned with the 2050 climate neutrality objective of the Paris Agreement as well as intermediate targets under EU climate law. Under the CSDDD, companies are expected to integrate due diligence into their policies and management systems. They must conduct due diligence regularly, take appropriate measures to address potential and actual adverse impacts and risks, and publicly communicate on their due diligence efforts. The CSDDD also includes provisions for enforcement and access to legal remedies for those affected by companies’ failure to comply with their risk management and due diligence obligations. It aims to level the playing field for businesses in the EU by ensuring that all companies adhere to the same high standards of corporate responsibility, thereby contributing to a sustainable economy and a better future. 109 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Each of the creditor groups referred to below under this caption constitute an “Instructing Group.” (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, the Super Senior Lenders, the Additional Super Senior Lenders and the Priority Hedge Counterparties whose credit participations represent more than 66[2]∕3% of the aggregate credit participations of all Super Senior Lenders, Additional Super Senior Lenders and Priority Hedge Counterparties (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); (b) In relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement: (i) Prior to the first date on which all Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged to the satisfaction of the Super Senior Agent (in the case of the Super Senior Debt Liabilities), each Cash Management Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (in the case of its Cash Management Liabilities) and each Priority Hedge Counterparty (in the case of its Priority Hedging Liabilities), whether or not as the result of an enforcement, and the Super Senior Creditors (in that capacity) are under no further obligation to provide financial accommodation to any of the debtors under the debt documents (such date, the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in each case subject to a consultation period referred to under the caption “—Consultation” below and provided that such instructions are consistent with the “Security Enforcement Principles” (as defined below) as generally described below under the caption “—Security Enforcement Principles”; and (ii) On or after the Super Senior Lender Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors; and (c) Following the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, those Senior Subordinated Creditors whose credit participations at that time aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate credit participations of all Senior Subordinated Creditors (the “Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors”). _Consultation_ Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction Security and/or the requesting of a “distressed disposal” and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction Security on a distressed disposal (each an “Enforcement”), the relevant creditor representative(s) of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall first notify the Security Agent and the creditor representative for each of the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has become enforceable. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may be), the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which the Super Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Senior Credit Facility Agent and the Trustee will consult in good faith with each other and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 30 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) (the “Consultation Period”) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy. Generally, no such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles (“Qualifying Instructions”)) where: 126 ----- (a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting the Company, any Debtor (owing liabilities to any Primary Creditor or the Company) or any “significant subsidiary” (as applicable) (each a “Relevant Company”); or (b) subject to no instructions being given by an Instructing Group at any time (whether before or after the end of the Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred which is continuing with respect to a Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company, if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith (and notify the creditor representatives of the other Super Senior Lenders, Cash Management Providers (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Additional Super Senior Lenders, Priority Hedge Counterparties, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the “Payments Waterfall” (as defined below) described below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall”) the Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or, as the case may be, the Super Senior Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received. If, following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the same. Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes silence is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received from either Instructing Group by the end of (or following) the Consultation Period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that any such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked. If, prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, either (x) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the end of the Consultation Period, (y) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period or (z) at any time (whether before or after the end of the Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Third Party Security Provider or Relevant Company, then, in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement, the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors). _Security Enforcement Principles_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which principles shall include the following: (a) It shall be the aim of any Enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and their representatives, and the Senior Subordinated Creditors (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure such debt) and their representatives (the “Security Enforcement Objective”). (b) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective and unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Transaction Security will be enforced and any other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either: (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (ii) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full. 127 ----- (c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious and should be reasonably expected to realize value from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to Enforcement by no later than the day falling six (6) months after the last day of the Consultation Period. (d) On: (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of the Restricted Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Restricted Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group) shall (unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert: (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective and maximize the recovery of any such Enforcement Action; (B) that the proceeds received from Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances; and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. (e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. It is understood that the Financial Advisor may limit its liability in respect of the opinion referred to in paragraph (d) above to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement. The Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met. Unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, following the expiry of the six (6) month period referred to above, the Security Enforcement Objective shall cease to apply to any enforcement of the Transaction Security until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred. In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Restricted Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction. Nothing in the Security Enforcement Principles requires Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction. In the absence of written notice from a Creditor or group of Creditors that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such Creditor(s) object(s) to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s Opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the _Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance requirements and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral,”_ “—Other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance statutes may adversely affect _their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ The Issuer is a holding company that does not have, and is not expected to have, any revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have, and is not expected to have, any business operations or material assets (other than its shareholding in Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l.). Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors). Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory and other legal limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, equity subordination, fraudulent preference, interest tripping, controlled foreign corporation, tax restrictions, capital maintenance, transfer pricing, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. By virtue of such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may effectively have no obligation under its Guarantee. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance, capital maintenance, liquidity protection and other laws.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the 150 ----- Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a mandatory prepayment of certain Indebtedness. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under certain Indebtedness and may require a mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The _Issuer may not be able to repay the Notes, when due or to repurchase the Notes when the Issuer is required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a Change of Control or otherwise, and the Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated or leverage-based restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that; (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

However, a default under clause (3), (4) or (6) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to such clauses the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in such clauses, as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by a responsible officer of the Trustee at the corporate trust office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) above shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, 177 ----- indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes, unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction.

The “centre of main interests” is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Pursuant to Article 3(1) paragraph 2 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the centre of main interests of a company or legal person is presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the centre of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). If the “centre of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot 217 ----- be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective Member State’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove the debtor’s assets from the territory of the Member State in which they are situated), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking with respect to the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 (3) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner or the debtor in possession in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. In the case where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Certain preferred creditors of a Luxembourg Obligor (including the Luxembourg tax, social security and other authorities) may have a privilege that ranks senior to the rights of the secured or unsecured creditors. The appointment of a foreign security agent or trustee will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent that such designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending on the type of the security right. In general, a security right over financial collateral may be granted in favor of an agent, a fiduciary or a trustee acting as holder of the security right for the collateral taker in order to secure the claims of present or future third party secured creditors, provided that these secured creditors are identified or can be identified. Without prejudice to its obligations vis-à-vis such third party secured creditors, an agent, a fiduciary or a trustee acting for these secured creditors is entitled to the same rights as a secured creditor who is directly holding a security right granted to its benefit, all in accordance with article 2(4) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to Luxembourg security interests falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law 2005. In such situation, Luxembourg hardening period (période suspecte) rules are disapplied (save for the case of fraud). Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where judicial reorganization proceedings under the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act have been opened in respect of the debtor of the secured debt, the relevant creditors of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantors may, under certain very limited circumstances, be temporarily suspended from accelerating the secured debt in accordance with Article 30 of the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act and hence face a situation where enforcing their security rights under the Collateral might be delayed. The perfection of the security interests does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the security interest will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Attachments will not apply to or have in impact on financial collateral arrangements subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes in particular the rights relating 222 ----- to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party.

A Luxembourg Guarantor may give a Guarantee provided the giving of the Guarantee is covered by that Luxembourg Guarantor’s corporate purpose, corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the company. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the Luxembourg Guarantor derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the interest of the group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases result in the Guarantee being held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the Luxembourg Guarantor (i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the Luxembourg Guarantor's own funds (capitaux propres)), the Luxembourg Guarantor must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective. As a result, the Guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg Guarantor may be subject to limitations in order to ensure their enforceability. Further, a Guarantee or security interest that substantially exceeds the Luxembourg Guarantor's ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the Guarantee/security provider and to its other creditors, or from which the Luxembourg Guarantor derives no or very limited direct benefit in return, or where no direct or indirect consideration is granted to the company in exchange, would expose its directors or managers to personal liability. In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg Guarantor, in extreme circumstances the Guarantee or security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public), in the case of facts consisting of a misuse of corporate assets. Any up-stream or crossstream Guarantee or security granted in connection with the Notes by the Luxembourg Guarantor will be limited to a certain percentage of, among others, the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds and subordinated debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be initiated against a Luxembourg Obligor, as a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its centre of main interests (within the meaning of EU Insolvency Regulation or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of main interests is located in a jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable): - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by any Luxembourg Obligor, by any of its creditors or by the Luxembourg district court (tribunal d’arrondissement siégeant en matière _commerciale) (the “Luxembourg Court”) ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg Court_ having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg Obligor (i) is in a state of cessation of payment (cessation des paiement) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). Save in case of suspension of such obligation following (i) the application for reorganization proceedings, or (ii) any applicable stay measures, with respect to a Luxembourg Obligor under the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act (as defined below), the managers or directors of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor have the obligation to file for bankruptcy within one month in case it is in a state of cessation of payment (cessation de paiement). The main effects of such proceedings are the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the relevant Luxembourg Obligor, subject to certain limited exceptions under the applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg Obligor that ceases its payments (i.e., is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of such Luxembourg Obligor’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of such Luxembourg Obligor’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third-parties on the basis of principles of managers’ and directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with Article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code (code de commerce); or - the following proceedings which were introduced by the Luxembourg law of 7 August 2023 on the preservation of businesses and modernising bankruptcy law, implementing Directive EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt (the “Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act”) which entered into force on 1[st] November 2023; - a preventive reorganisation procedure, such as conservatory measures (notably the appointment of a conciliator); - an out-of-court reorganisation procedure by mutual agreement (réorganisation par _accord amiable) whereby any Luxembourg Obligor and at least two of its creditors_ mutually agree to reorganize all or part of the assets, or the business, of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor which agreement can be validated by the Luxembourg Court upon request of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor; and - any of three types of judicial reorganisation proceedings depending on the objective of the procedure (noting that a judicial reorganization proceeding can pursue a specific objective for each activity): - obtaining a stay of proceedings (sursis) to conclude an amicable agreement (accord amiable) within the reorganization by amicable agreement; - obtaining the creditors’ consent on a reorganization plan to reach a collective agreement (réorganisation judiciaire par accord collectif), which is deemed to have been approved by the creditors entitled to vote if it receives, in each category of creditors, a favorable vote from a majority of the creditors within a category, representing at least half of all sums due in that category. Such plan, if approved by the court, is binding on all creditors. However, if rejected, the court can still approve the plan (in case rejected by such creditors) (cram-down) if (i) the plan has been approved by at least one category of creditors entitled to 219 ----- vote, (ii) it is approved by ordinary creditors only, then the plan must ensure that extraordinary creditors are treated more favorably, and (iii) no category can receive or keep more than the total amount of its claims; or - the transfer, by a court decision, of all or part of any Luxembourg Obligor’s assets or business, whereby all or part of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor’s assets or business will be transferred to one or more third parties, which can be initiated either by that Luxembourg Obligor or by the state prosecutor. When a reorganization procedure is opened, a stay (sursis) on payments for a maximum of four months begins, also with possible extensions of up to a total of 12 months. Existing agreements and financial arrangements are still enforceable (with exceptions, not applicable to employment agreements) – financial collateral arrangements, set-off or netting arrangements under the Financial Collateral Law 2005 and professional payment guarantees remain enforceable and unaffected by a judicial reorganization procedure, thus continuing to benefit creditors. Ongoing contracts will also continue. Payments are effective against third parties and new liabilities are considered as being debts of the insolvency estate. As from the entry into force of the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act (i.e., 1[st] November 2023), the previous existing procedures of preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) and controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée) have been repealed are no longer be available under Luxembourg law (except for proceedings already opened, which will continue to be governed by these provisions). In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment under the Notes issued by the Issuer and the guarantees given by the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg Court to grant a stay on payment (sursis de paiement) or to put that Luxembourg Obligor into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) or by an administrative dissolution without liquidation (dissolution administrative sans liquidation). - Judicial liquidation: judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against any Luxembourg Obligor pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg laws governing commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. - Suspension of payment proceedings: a suspension of payment (sursis de paiement) can only be applied to a Luxembourg Obligor which, as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts. The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a Luxembourg Obligor experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the Luxembourg Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor's debts (excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)). The suspension of payment is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the relevant Luxembourg Obligor prior to obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned. During the suspension of payment, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against the relevant Luxembourg Obligor, or its assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which are secured by mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. The relevant Luxembourg Obligor continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a court-appointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions carried out by the applicant. When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the relevant Luxembourg Obligor's managers can run the business again. - Administrative dissolution without liquidation: an administrative dissolution without liquidation (dissolution administrative sans liquidation) proceeding may be opened by the manager of the Luxembourg Register of Commerce and Companies (Registre de Commerce et des Sociétés, _Luxembourg) at the request of the public prosecutor against any Luxembourg Obligor that will complete_ and result in the dissolution of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor if the following three cumulative conditions are met: (i) the relevant Luxembourg Obligor must have no assets, (ii) the relevant Luxembourg Obligor must have no employees and (iii) the relevant Luxembourg Obligor must pursue activities contrary to criminal law or which seriously contravene the provisions of the Luxembourg 220 ----- commercial code or the laws governing commercial companies, including the right of establishment. The administrative dissolution procedure without liquidation is closed at the latest six (6) months after the publication of the opening decision. Liability of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantors in respect of the relevant Notes or Guarantees, as applicable, will, in the event of a liquidation of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg direct tax authorities (Administration des contributions _directes);_ - employer’s contribution to social security; - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; - chamber of commerce contribution; and - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). _Impact of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings on transactions_ During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by any Luxembourg Obligor during the hardening period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months, as from the date on which the Luxembourg Court formally adjudicates a Luxembourg Obligor bankrupt and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period, preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was preceeded by another insolvency proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payment) under Luxembourg law. In particular: - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, netting, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the hardening period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the hardening period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments such hardening period rule does not apply for financial collateral arrangements, netting and set-off arrangements subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005, and - pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and Article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg District Court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its 221 ----- solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue _vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on any Luxembourg Obligor’s business and assets or that Luxembourg Obligor’s obligations under the Notes, security interests (save for financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005) or the Guarantees, as applicable. Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy or bankruptcy reorganization may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation applies will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 and Article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In the event of an insolvency of these certain Guarantors, insolvency proceedings are likely to be initiated in Germany if these Guarantors were held to have their “centre of main interests” (as such term is described in Article 3 (1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed (each a “German Domiciled Entity”) and German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept. This generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these 223 ----- insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group.

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the Notes, the Guarantees or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable, without preference in insolvency proceedings. Against this background, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing), whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect), whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors; - any legal transaction effected by the debtor that directly disadvantages the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against the debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided that it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the other party to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing) at the time of the transaction, whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; 228 ----- - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the hardening period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and a related party (nahestehende _Person) which directly disadvantages the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as at the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security (Sicherung), the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction (Befriedigung), the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors, provided that, if the relevant act by the debtor consisted of a settlement of an obligation or the grant of a security which was due to be paid or granted, as the case may be, then the knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors is only presumed if the other party was aware of the actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor and of the fact that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged _i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg). Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts. 229 ----- A creditor of a German Domiciled Entity who benefits from a transaction that constitutes (or is considered to be) a repayment of the registered share capital of a German Domiciled Entity could, moreover, become personally liable for damages under exceptional circumstances such as if the creditor were to act, in collusion with such German Domiciled Entity (kollusives Zusammenwirken), with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (“Corporate Stabilization",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,169,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,169.4,"Insolvency Act”), but this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of",169.4.4,,"group companies. The Group Insolvency Act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or a pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. However, the German Insolvency Code provides for certain mechanisms designed to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated (without any obligation of the court to do so); (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditor’' committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for coordination proceedings (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a coordination insolvency administrator (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a coordination plan (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht). In the case of European Union cross-border group insolvencies, Articles 56 et seq. of the EU Insolvency Regulation introduced obligations for communication and cooperation between the administrators and courts involved. In addition, a coordination procedure can be initiated which enables the appointment of a coordinator and the elaboration of a cross-border coordination plan. Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex _officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency_ proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor (i.e., where its liabilities exceed the value of its assets) unless the debtor’s business is predominantly likely to continue as a going concern (positive Fortführungsprognose) or in the event of illiquidity, i.e., that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend _wahrscheinlich) for the current and the subsequent fiscal year (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor_ is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft, “AG”), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner becomes illiquid or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three weeks in the case of illiquidity and within six weeks in the case of over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes the management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes or the Guarantees, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payment obligations but will presumably not be able to do so. A debtor is not considered over indebted even when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s business can survive as a going concern. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e., if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time within a certain prognosis period, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted (Überschuldung) it may also file for preliminary debtor in possession moratorium proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless - from a thirdparty perspective - there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring (negative Fortführungsprognose). Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). The court may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. During the debtor-in-possession proceedings it also has to be ensured that the debtor is willing and able to adapt its management to the interests of the creditors. Therefore, German insolvency law requires debtor-in-possession planning as a filing condition. The debtor-in-possession plan consists of the following components: 224 ----- - a financial plan for the period of six months, confirming that the costs of the proceedings will be covered in addition to the costs of continuing business operations. The plan must also set out the sources of financing; - a concept for the implementation of the debtor-in-possession proceedings, in which in particular the extent and causes of the crisis are analyzed and necessary measures for overcoming it are determined; - a report on the status of negotiations with creditors, shareholders and third parties; - a description of the precautions taken by the debtor to fulfil its obligations under insolvency law; and - a substantiated description of the additional or reduced costs of debtor-in-possession proceedings compared to regular insolvency proceedings. (Prognostic) advisor and court costs must also be taken into account. The depth of the presentation and the degree of detail are to be determined in each individual case and depend on the size and the specific circumstances of the debtor. The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties_ of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor and other measures the court sees as appropriate. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements: - balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted); - revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter)_ or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for debtor in possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorläufiger) Sachwalter). If the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible, i.e., incompetent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does include a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency 225 ----- court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Unless the court has ordered debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, _i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten), which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings. From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the assets of any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of any German Domiciled Entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of any German Domiciled Entity’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings with respect to the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be ruled invalid by a German court if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht _des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate_ to agreements that are not governed by German law. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to 226 ----- enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his, her or the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) has decided that the secured creditor is entitled to initiate enforcement of preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) with respect to IP pledges (and general view of legal literature is that this shall also be the case for pledges over shares or company interests) forming part of the insolvency estate. In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus value added tax (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims — _Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Therefore, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of any German Guarantor in full after secured creditors (if any) have been satisfied. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other nonsubordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the relevant debtor, guarantor or grantor of security. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, guarantor or grantor of security, the claims against such debtor, guarantor or grantor of security would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code) will itself be exposed to a claw-back risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the period of one year. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (or in any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige _Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured_ insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under “Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.” While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of a Domiciled Entity’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of such German Domiciled Entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of such German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can under certain circumstances be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may — upon application of the filing debtor — be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion 227 ----- being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.

KG”). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders (or the subsidiaries of such direct or indirect shareholders) to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets less liabilities and liability reserves) - or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets - is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). Guarantees or security interests granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under sections 30 and 31 GmbHG. Moreover, under section 15b(1) in connection with paragraph 5 German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) members of the representative body and liquidators of a legal person who are subject to the obligation to file an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (antragspflichtige Mitglieder des Vertretungsorgans und Abwickler einer juristischen Person), _e.g., a managing director (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH, can be held personally liable in certain circumstances for payments to shareholders that would render the GmbH illiquid. The granting of guarantees and security interests for the benefit of direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the GmbH could be considered as such disbursements and payments to shareholders. In relation to a GmbH & Co. KG the capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules and principles described above for GmbHs apply, mutatis mutandis, also to the general partners of the GmbH & Co. KGs. 231 ----- Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to provide security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating German capital maintenance and/or liquidity maintenance rules and to limit any potential personal liability of the management, it is standard market practice for notes, credit agreements, indentures, related guarantees and related security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation language,” the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security interests against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s— or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital and thereby violating sections 30 and 31 GmbHG. Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Indenture and security documents will contain a limitation language substantially in the form as follows. Pursuant to such limitation language the beneficiaries of any guarantee and/or security interests agree to enforce against a German Guarantor and/or security grantor which is a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG, AG, or AG & Co. KG only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of sections 57, 71 a AktG (in relation to an AG and an AG & Co. KG) or sections 30 and 31 GmbHG (in relation to a GmbH and GmbH & Co. KG), respectively. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantor to make payment on the Notes or of the German Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the related guarantees or the enforceability of the Guarantees, the Indenture and the security documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives its company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interests granted by a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees and/or security interests to be granted by any of the German Guarantors (including in the legal form of a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft). Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of such guarantee or security interest) could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,169,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,169.6,Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent,169.6.3,Security Interests/Parallel Debt,"Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and are strictly linked to the existence, the extent and the enforceability of the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the secured claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest. The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes. The holders of the Notes on the other hand are creditors under the Notes and the Guarantees. In order to allow the holders of the Notes to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the holders’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment with respect to the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment with respect to the parallel 232 ----- debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear certain risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor’s management may (but is not obliged to) alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the company is imminently illiquid (see above). The restructuring tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act are not available in case the debtor is already illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) and/or at the same time over-indebted (überschuldet) and obliged to file for insolvency. Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort), only certain types (for example, financial liabilities, including the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum. The tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately, however certain tools may be extended to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor. The core component of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-insolvency restructuring of the debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), including, for example, by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates, maturities of liabilities or covenants. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, for example, a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan, which can be submitted solely by the debtor, will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined 230 ----- by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, _provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the noteholders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Domiciled Entity would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the Noteholder can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (for example, in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Noteholder without the consent of each Noteholder (generally, the relevant majority requirement is 75% of the respective principal amount) and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the Noteholders. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any Member State pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that regulation. However, this does not apply to plans in non-public restructuring matters under the Corporate Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,169,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS,169.7,Netherlands,169.7.1,,"There are three applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations: (a) suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, (b) a private composition (onderhands akkoord), which is also intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern and (c) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the most commonly used insolvency regime and may result in the transfer of parts of the Dutch Guarantor as a going concern. A suspension of payments almost always results in the debtor’s bankruptcy. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below. Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments, but it will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the near future. The fact that the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated, and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension of payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: 233 ----- (a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against the Dutch Guarantor would allow secured creditors (and in case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets that secure their claims as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt entity. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt entity’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of guarantees and security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights as described above may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time. If such time is not met, the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be off set against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under Dutch law, bankruptcy and suspension of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the judgment of the bankruptcy or the suspension of payments. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. All unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. As a general rule, claims of unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy to be verified. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings for voting. In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of notes to recover less than the principal amount of their notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of notes to be delayed. Interest on the notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or 234 ----- their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. As regards, the private composition regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility to offer composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet _homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”). The private_ composition regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross-class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims against the Dutch Guarantor being compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of the trustee and/or the holders of the notes under the indentures and therefore the notes. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two-thirds of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two-thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (a “cross-class cramdown”). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge. In the event that the Dutch Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor. Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may be affected by (a) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden); and (c) the other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the notes. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor under the notes may be successfully contested by the Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor do not fall within the scope of the objects clause as set out in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company’s counterparty knew or ought to have known (without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the objects and purposes of the Dutch Guarantor, a court will consider (i) the text of the objects clause in the company’s articles of association and (ii) all relevant circumstances including whether the granting of such guarantee or security interest is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit and whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting of such security interest. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in the Dutch Guarantor’s objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires. A legal act, including the grant of a guarantee or security right granted by a Dutch company may be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te _Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary_ receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the Dutch Guarantor has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be 235 ----- made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or in an agreement with, as well as the Dutch Guarantor itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. The guarantee itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. To the extent Dutch law applies, any creditor of the Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or receiver) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or receiver) in connection with the notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) any transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the notes was conducted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its/their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions) and (iii) at the time of any transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the notes was conducted, the Dutch Guarantor and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of parallel debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, noteholders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the noteholders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the parallel debt. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered. The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs. A receiver in bankruptcy may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt entity materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt entity which are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt entity and its counterparty when the shares in both are held indirectly by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt entity and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte _rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy_ had been filed, or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty with a view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. 236 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The insolvency laws of Poland are primarily set out in the Bankruptcy Law dated February 28, 2003, as amended (Prawo upadłościowe) (the “Polish Insolvency Law”).

However, the aim of bankruptcy is not only to satisfy creditors, but also to preserve the distressed business if “rational reasons” so permit. Accordingly, it is possible to reach a composition in the course of bankruptcy proceedings, although the submission of composition proposals will not automatically result in a stay of liquidation. The provisions of the Restructuring Law apply accordingly to a composition concluded in bankruptcy proceedings and its effects (to the extent not regulated otherwise in the Polish Insolvency Law). The Polish Insolvency Law also regulates pre-packs (przygotowana likwidacja). It is possible to file with the court, together with a bankruptcy petition, a motion for approval of the terms of sale of the whole distressed business or a substantial part thereof. It must specify the terms of the sale (stating at least the price and the purchaser, although it is also possible to submit a draft sale agreement to be concluded by the trustee), and be accompanied by a valuation report prepared by a certified court expert as well as a proof of payment of a security deposit (wadium). The application for approval of the terms of sale or a draft sale agreement should also specify address or e-mail of the purchaser. It is possible to request that the debtor’s enterprise be handed over to the buyer on the day bankruptcy is declared, in which case the full price will have to be paid in advance to the court’s deposit account. The court will approve the motion if the offered price is higher than the estimated liquidation proceeds that could be raised in “standard” bankruptcy proceedings, less the estimated costs of the proceedings. If the offered price is lower than (but still close to) the estimated net liquidation proceeds, the court will still be in a position to approve the sale if this is supported by an “important social interest” or if this allows the distressed enterprise to be preserved. Any contractual provisions stipulating a modification or termination of a legal relationship with the debtor in the event of a bankruptcy declaration or filing of a bankruptcy petition are void by operation of law. This does not mean that it is impossible to terminate or modify a contract with the debtor after a bankruptcy petition is filed or after it is declared bankrupt, but it is impossible to do so by reference to the filing or to the declaration of bankruptcy. The Polish Insolvency Law sets out specific rules applicable to termination of certain contracts and it grants the trustee the right to „cherry-pick” executory contracts (i.e. those that have not been performed in full or part before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings), but otherwise, if the trustee fails to perform a contract, the other party should be able to terminate it based on generally applicable provisions of law and subject to the terms of the contract. 238 ----- The bankrupt’s claim may be set off against a creditor’s claim if both claims existed on the date of declaration of bankruptcy, regardless of whether the claims have not yet become due and payable. A set-off is not admissible if the bankrupt’s debtor acquired the claim by assignment or endorsement after bankruptcy was declared or acquired it during the year preceding the date of declaration of bankruptcy, while being aware that there were grounds for declaring bankruptcy. However, this limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has become the bankrupt’s creditor as a result of repaying the bankrupt’s debt, for which it was liable personally or with certain property items, and if the acquirer was not aware of the existence of grounds for declaring bankruptcy at the time of assuming liability for the bankrupt’s debt or (ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year before the date on which bankruptcy was declared. The set off is also not admissible if bankrupt’s creditor become bankrupt’s debtor after the date of declaration of bankruptcy. The sum proposed to be set off on the part of the bankrupt is the total of the bankrupt’s claim and on the part of the creditor it is the creditor’s principal claim only, along with interests accrued until the date of declaring bankruptcy. If the bankrupt’s debt without interest had not become due and payable by the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the sum to be set-off is the amount due reduced by statutory interest (which may not exceed six percent) between the date of declaration of bankruptcy until the date of payment, and may not exceed two years. A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right must make a statement in this respect not later than when submitting the claim. Once bankruptcy is declared, the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be subject to security, charged with a pledge, registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers may be made to establish any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such entry had been filed at least six months prior to filing the motion for bankruptcy. The Polish Insolvency Law does not require a bankruptcy receiver to give effect to intercreditor arrangements such as subordination agreements. Although the law does not preclude creditors from attempting to enforce such rights in separate proceedings based on their entitlements arising from respective contracts, such proceedings are conducted outside of and following bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, the claims of all unsecured creditors may be paid on a _pari passu basis in bankruptcy proceedings. As a rule, Polish Company’s debts are divided into four categories and creditors whose receivables are ranked in a lower category cannot be satisfied before all the debts in the higher category have been fully satisfied. The first category principally includes payments to the state or employees (remuneration, health benefit payments and social security obligations, etc.) or related to the restructuring proceedings (including arising under a credit facility, loan, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit, or other form of financing envisaged in the arrangement concluded in the restructuring proceedings and provided in connection with the arrangement’s performance). Most unsecured commercial debts, tax and other public dues are listed in the second category. The third category encompasses interest on debts in the first and second categories (in the order in which the principal is satisfied), court or administrative penalties, donations etc. The fourth category concerns debts to direct and certain indirect shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect that were granted within five years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy including interest accrued thereon. Within a category, each creditor’s receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in that category. Before satisfying any claims, the bankruptcy receiver covers the costs of bankruptcy proceedings and the liabilities of the bankruptcy estate. Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision declaring bankruptcy. Under the Polish Insolvency Law, any debt payable in a currency other than Polish zloty (such as euro), if being put on the list of claims, must be converted into Polish zloty according to the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate prevailing on the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has fallen due or not). Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in the list of claims. If a claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal. The claims are submitted electronically via a computerized system servicing the proceedings. In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, an arrangement between the debtor and creditors can be voted on and approved by the creditors. In such case after the approval by the court, the provisions of the arrangement determine the manner of satisfaction of creditors’ receivables. If the repayment of receivables arising under the Note Guarantee is covered by the arrangement, there is a possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Insolvency Law). The Polish Insolvency Law provides that the terms of agreements with the debtor that make it impossible or difficult to achieve the purposes of bankruptcy proceedings will be ineffective vis-à-vis the bankrupt estate.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

A creditor may apply for remedial proceeding (one of the types of the Restructuring Proceedings (please see below)) but only if a debtor is insolvent. The Restructuring Proceedings may be carried out against a debtor who is insolvent and/or at risk of insolvency. An insolvent debtor shall be construed as a debtor who is insolvent in the meaning of the Polish Insolvency Law. A debtor 239 ----- threatened with insolvency shall be construed as a debtor whose economic situation indicates that he may soon become insolvent. The Restructuring Proceedings shall be instituted on the basis of the restructuring application filed by the debtor (or creditor, if he is allowed to apply for remedial proceeding). The restructuring application shall be construed as an application for the opening of the restructuring proceedings or an application for the approval of the arrangement adopted in the arrangement approval proceedings. In the case of filing a restructuring application and a bankruptcy application, the restructuring application shall be examined first. The purpose of the Restructuring Proceedings is to avoid a declaration of bankruptcy of the debtor by enabling him to restructure through an arrangement with creditors and, in the case of remedial proceedings, by carrying out remedial actions, while safeguarding the legitimate rights of creditors. The arrangement approval proceedings shall enable the conclusion of the arrangement, where the debtor shall collect the creditors' votes by himself without involvement of the court and may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement. The accelerated arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after a list of claims under a simplified procedure has been prepared and approved; it may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement. The arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after a list of claims has been prepared and approved and may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement exceeds 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement. The remedial proceedings shall enable implementation of remedial measures and conclusion of the arrangement after a list of claims has been prepared and approved. Cases in the Restructuring Proceedings shall be examined by a restructuring court, which is a district commercial court. The restructuring shall be carried out under the following Restructuring Proceedings: (i) arrangement approval proceedings (postępowanie o zatwierdzenie układu), (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings (przyspieszone _postępowanie układowe), (iii) arrangement proceedings (postępowanie układowe), (iv) remedial proceedings_ (postępowanie sanacyjne). _Proceedings for approval of an arrangement (postępowanie o zatwierdzenie układu)_ The arrangement approval proceeding is available to debtors who are able to reach an arrangement with the required majority of creditors without the court’s involvement. As of 1 December 2021, the arrangement approval proceeding may be basically conducted in two forms: (i) with the Arrangement Notice (as defined below); or (ii) without the Arrangement Notice. In the latter case, the debtor will not be protected in relation to creditors (i.e. the creditors will be entitled to enforce their arrangement or non-arrangement (pozaukładowe) claims). The debtor will continue to manage its estate, but will be required to appoint a licensed supervisor (nadzorca _układu), who will: (i) prepare a restructuring plan, (ii) cooperate with the debtor in preparing the arrangement proposals,_ (iii) prepare a list of claims and a list of disputed claims, (iv) assist the debtor in collecting the votes of creditors, and (v) prepare a report containing a feasibility assessment of the arrangement. The licensed supervisor may make a notice setting the date of the arrangement (the “Arrangement Notice”) and no judicial action will be required. In particular, from the Arrangement Notice (i) a four-month moratorium will apply to enforcement actions; (ii) the debtor’s management of its assets is limited to ordinary management, and any actions exceeding such scope will require the consent of the licensed supervisor and (iii) it is prohibited to terminate contracts that are essential to the operation of the debtor’s business. The debtor’s voluntary repayment of debts to be covered by the arrangement is not prohibited during the four-month period. The making of the Arrangement Notice is inadmissible if, within the last ten years, the debtor has conducted the arrangement approval proceedings in which the Arrangement Notice has been made, or within the last ten years, restructuring proceedings conducted against the debtor have been discontinued, except when the discontinuance of restructuring proceedings has taken place with the consent of the council of creditors. The debtor will present a restructuring plan to its creditors and request their votes. Once the approving votes of the required majority have been obtained, the debtor will file a motion with the court for the approval of the arrangement. The motion should be filed within three months of the appointment of the arrangement supervisor. 240 ----- If, within four months from the Arrangement Notice, the debtor does not apply to the court for approval of the arrangement, the effect of the Arrangement Notice shall be extinguished by operation of law. _Accelerated arrangement proceedings (przyspieszone postępowanie układowe)_ The procedure of the accelerated arrangement proceedings is simplified (in comparison to ‘standard’ arrangement proceedings), especially in relation to the allowance of claims. Once the proceedings commence, the debtor is not allowed to perform its obligations, whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary, to be covered by the arrangement. As a rule, this applies to any pre-petition obligations and post-petition interest, except for employment-related claims and secured claims. Enforcement proceedings relating to claims to be covered by the arrangement will be stayed by operation of law, and the judge-commissioner will be in a position to revoke pre-petition attachments of the debtor’s assets. The court will notify creditors of a creditors’ meeting and the creditors will vote at the meeting (in contrast to arrangement approval proceedings). The debtor’s estate (‘arrangement estate’) will continue to be managed by the debtor-in-possession, but a court supervisor (nadzorca sądowy) will be appointed to supervise its management (however, optionally the court may appoint an administrator (zarządca) to assume full management of the arrangement estate). _‘Standard’ arrangement proceedings (postępowanie układowe)_ For the interim period between the filing and the opening of arrangement proceedings, the court will be able to secure the arrangement estate by appointing a temporary court supervisor (tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy). Otherwise, the scope of protection against creditors available to the debtor, its right to manage the business and other effects of the initiation of the proceedings will be similar to those applicable to Accelerated Arrangement Proceedings. However, because of the higher percentage of disputed claims, the allowance of claims is more formalized and time-consuming, and there are further consequential differences (e.g. relating to the determination of components of the estate and the impact of the proceedings on pending litigation and administrative proceedings). It is assumed that, depending on the number of pleas against the list of claims and their complexity, it should take approximately six to ten months to complete arrangement proceedings. _Remedial proceedings (postępowanie sanacyjne)_ The broadest restructuring options and the broadest scope of protection against creditors are envisaged in remedial proceedings. The appointment of an administrator (zarządca) to manage the debtor’s estate (‘remedial estate’) will be mandatory, unless the debtor’s involvement is necessary for successful restructuring and the debtor guarantees ‘proper management’ (in which case the court may agree to the debtor’s retaining management over all or part of the business). Remedial proceedings offer certain remedial options previously available only in liquidation proceedings under the Polish Insolvency Law and enable thorough economic restructuring of an undertaking. For example, (i) the court can secure the estate by appointing an interim court supervisor (tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy) or an interim administrator (tymczasowy _zarządca) for the period between the filing and the opening of remedial proceedings, (ii) powers of attorney and commercial_ procuration (prokura) will expire by operation of law, (iii) it will be possible to adjust the employment level to the needs of the reorganised undertaking, (iv) the administrator will be entitled to rescind executory contracts (‘cherry-picking right’), and (v) redundant assets can be sold free of encumbrances (as if they were sold in enforcement proceedings).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

However, if a motion to register a mortgage or a registered pledge is filed more than six months before the filing of a motion to open Restructuring Proceedings, the mortgage or pledge will be registered. This does not modify the general rule that pre-petition in rem security interests (e.g., mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, security assignment) survive the Restructuring Proceedings and the claims secured by any of these security interests, as a rule, are not affected by the arrangement. However, the arrangement will cover secured claims to the extent that these claims are not covered by the value of collateral, or the relevant secured creditor agrees to be covered by the arrangement. Secured creditors consenting to the arrangement may be allocated to a separate class of creditors and be afforded special treatment in the arrangement (i.e., different from unsecured creditors). There is an important exception to this rule in relation to partial arrangements (which are permitted in arrangement approval proceedings and accelerated arrangement proceedings), if the proposed arrangement offers the relevant secured creditor full satisfaction (although on a date specified in the arrangement) or satisfaction in part, but to the extent not lower than that expected in the case of enforcement of security. If this exception applies, the relevant secured claim will be covered by the arrangement irrespective of the creditor's consent. 241 ----- Certain security interests will be infective towards the remedial estate (masa sanacyjna), namely: (i) security established by the debtor within one year before the date of filing the application for the opening of remedial proceedings which has not been established directly in connection with the receipt of the performance by the debtor shall be ineffective in relation to the remedial estate; (ii) security in the part which on the day of the establishment of the security exceeds more than half the value of the secured performance received by the debtor together with claims for incidental performance determined in the document forming the grounds to provide security, established within the year prior to the date of the filing of the application for the opening of remedial proceedings, shall be ineffective in relation to the remedial estate. The above rules also apply to guarantees, suretyships (Polish: poręczenia) and to other similar activities performed to secure performances. In addition, there are certain legal transactions, other than security interests, which are ineffective towards the remedial estate – namely, transactions by means of which the debtor has disposed of its assets, if they were concluded by the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted and the value of the debtor's performance (Polish: _świadczenie) significantly exceeds the value of the performance received by or reserved for the debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Sums obtained from the transfer of assets and rights encumbered with a mortgage or pledge will be allocated to satisfy those creditors whose receivable debts were secured over the transferred assets or rights (upon a statutory deduction for the costs of the proceedings). The Polish Insolvency Law governs the priority of claims for (i) secured creditors (i.e., creditors whose claims are secured by a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or treasury pledge) and (ii) other creditors. In the latter case, the Polish Insolvency Law provides for four categories of debts, which include a number of preferential debts (such as money owed to employees) and several less-preferential ones (ex. money owed to the shareholder and related to the shareholder's loan or arising from a similar legal action, which are repaid in the last 4th category). In cases where creditors have rights in rem to the sold tangible property or rights, the receiver makes a separate plan to distribute the money earned on the sold tangible property or rights. If the sum allocated for distribution is not sufficient to satisfy all the debts in full, debts of lower categories of priority are satisfied only after the full satisfaction of debts of preceding categories of priority, and when the assets are insufficient to satisfy in full all debts within the same category of priority, then such debts shall be satisfied on a pro rata basis.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Other actions detrimental to creditors may also be challenged on the basis of the Actio -Pauliana, governed by articles 527 onward of the Polish Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny). In addition, a transfer of future receivable is ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if such receivable arises after the declaration of bankruptcy, unless the agreement on the transfer of receivable was concluded in writing with a certified date (Polish: forma pisemna z datą pewną) at least six months before the day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted.

In general, if as a result of a legal act performed by a debtor to the detriment of creditors, a third party gains a financial benefit, each of the creditors may demand that the said act be declared ineffective with respect to it, if the debtor acted knowingly to the creditors' detriment, and the third party knew or, having used due care, could have learned of it. This provision applies accordingly if the debtor acts with an intention to harm future creditors. It is assumed that the debtor's legal act is performed to the creditors' detriment if, as a result of such act, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes insolvent to a greater degree than he was before performing the act (as described in the Supreme Court judgements Case No. II CSK 548/11). The application to the court with respect to “actio Pauliana” can be filed within five years from the date of the act. Furthermore, the Polish Civil Code stipulates that if a contract is executed whose performance renders the satisfaction of a third-party claim partly or wholly impossible, that party may demand that the contract be declared ineffective with respect to it if the parties to the contract knew of the claim or if the contract was free of charge. _Limitations resulting from the Polish Insolvency Law_ The aggregate liability and exposure of any Polish Guarantors under the Note Guarantees might be also limited to the extent required so that such obligations do not and cannot result in insolvency as defined by Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Insolvency Law. However, the above limitation will not apply if one or more of the following circumstances occurs: (i) any event of default is continuing irrespective of whether such event of default occurs before or after the relevant Polish Guarantor becomes insolvent within the meaning of Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Insolvency Law; or (ii) the liabilities of any Polish Guarantor (other than those under the finance documents) result in its insolvency within the meaning of Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Insolvency Law; or (iii) Polish law is amended in such a manner that balance sheet insolvency (Polish: niewypłacalność) as provided for in Art. 11 section 2 of the Polish Insolvency Law no longer gives grounds for bankruptcy or no longer obliges the Polish Guarantor to file for bankruptcy. Granting of the Note Guarantees by the Polish Guarantor is also subject to certain provisions of the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Polish: Kodeks Spółek Handlowych) of September 15, 2000, as amended (the “Polish Commercial Companies Code”). With respect to the limited liability company (Polish:** _spółka z ograniczoną _odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.) pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the creation of a limited right in rem_ over the enterprise or over its organized part requires a resolution of the shareholders under the pain of invalidity. Pursuant to Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the shareholders may not receive, under any title, any payments from the Polish limited liability company's assets needed to fully cover the share capital of this 243 ----- company. A breach of this rule results in the shareholders' obligation to return the payments up to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, the liability of any Guarantor incorporated under Polish law on account of payments under the Note Guarantees should be limited by the Polish capital maintenance rules i.e., so that it would not result in a payment being made in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code. If a share pledge is enforced and the shareholder changes, a new “relation of domination” might arise. In such case the new shareholder would be obliged to notify the dependent company, _i.e., the Polish Guarantor, of this fact. Otherwise, its right to vote from its shares representing more than 33% of the share capital of the dependent company will be suspended. A new relation of domination might also arise if under a pledge agreement, the pledgee gains a majority of the votes at the general meeting of the Polish Guarantor. The corresponding notification duty has to be fulfilled by the pledgee. _Interests limitation_ Pursuant to Article 359 of the Act of April 23, 1964 Civil Code, as amended (the “Civil Code”), the maximum interest resulting from the legal act, i.e., so called “capital interest” (Polish: odsetki kapitałowe) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest (i.e., double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 3.5 percentage points). In addition, according to the Article 481 of the Civil Code, the maximum interest resulting from a delay (Polish: _odsetki za opóźnienie) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest for delay (i.e., double of the sum of: (i) the_ reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 5.5 percentage points). Should the value of interest exceed the value of relevant maximum interest, then relevant maximum interest is due. Contractual provisions cannot exclude or limit the provisions on maximum interest. The above-mentioned specific provision of Polish law shall be applied by a Polish court irrespective of the fact that the parties have chosen foreign law to govern the transaction (overriding mandatory provisions). _Perfection requirements_ Generally, under Polish law, for a valid and effective establishment of security interests certain perfection requirements need to be fulfilled, including the requirements specified below. The registered civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the shares in the Polish Guarantor may be validly established only after fulfillment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper registered pledge agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the competent court and will become effective vis à vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such pledge; (ii) the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be executed with the signatures certified by a Polish notary and will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such pledge; (iii) the proper financial pledge agreement must be executed and will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such pledge, (iv) the pledges should be disclosed in the book of shares of the Polish Guarantor. Additional formal requirements are to be complied with. The registered civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the bank accounts the Polish Guarantor may be validly established only after fulfilment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper registered pledge agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the competent court; (ii) the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be executed with a certified date (i.e., a date certified by a Polish notary); (iii) the proper financial pledge agreement must be executed; (iv) the bank maintaining the bank account needs to be notified by the pledgor about the establishment of the civil (ordinary) and financial pledge; and (v) a financial pledge over the funds in a bank account should be noted in the relevant bank account that is the subject of the security. The agreement of the security assignment or transfer of ownership of a thing, receivable or of other right (even if governed by non-Polish law) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate (as defined by the Polish Insolvency Law) of the assignor, if it was executed in writing with a certified date (i.e., a date certified by a Polish notary). In principle, a secured creditor can enforce its security once the secured claim becomes mature, in whole or in part (that is, the debt becomes due and payable). Under certain circumstances, the creditor must obtain a final and nonappealable court decision and enforcement clause before enforcing its security. A less formal procedure is possible, for example, if the claim is secured by registered or financial pledge and the pledge agreement provides that the creditor can take over the pledge object. _Parallel debt structure under Polish law_ In majority of cases, under Polish law security interests cannot be granted to a party other than the creditor of the secured claim. Generally, under Polish law, the pledge or mortgage is strictly accessory and follows the debt or claim it secures and may not be transferred without such debt or claim. If such debt or claim is transferred without the pledge or mortgage, the pledge or mortgage will expire. 244 ----- For that reason, in certain transactions, also in Poland, a parallel debt structure is used, whereby the guarantor, as a separate and independent obligation governed by non-Polish law, undertakes to pay to the security agent amounts equal to the amounts due by it to all creditors in a given transaction. Such parallel debt structure, therefore, creates a single separate and independent claim of the security agent that can be validly secured by a security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the security agent in its own capacity as a creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative of the creditors. It is usually expressly agreed in such parallel debt agreement that the obligations of the debtor towards the security agent shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa). The Supreme Court issued the judgments on October 9, 2009 (Case No. IV CSK 145/09, Case No. IV CSK 169/09 and Case No. IV CSK 155/09) concerning the effectiveness of establishing security interests over the assets of the debtor of parallel debt. In the above cases, the Supreme Court has not challenged the validity of a foreign law parallel debt structure, however, such structure was only indirectly referred to in the above judgments. As there is no doctrine of “precedence” under Polish law, uncertainty exists as to validity and enforceability of the parallel debt under Polish law. As Polish law does not recognize the concept of “trust” or “trustee,” it is uncertain how the Security Agent will be treated by a Polish court.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

By default, the courts of Poland have jurisdiction over insolvency proceedings of a company with its center of main interests in Poland, presumably – incorporated and registered in Poland. The insolvency laws of Poland and, in particular, the provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law in relation to priority of creditors and the duration of insolvency proceedings may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments, to the extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. A declaration of bankruptcy should be issued in respect of a debtor that has become insolvent. A debtor is obliged, and each of the creditors has the right, to file a petition for bankruptcy, if the following bankruptcy tests are met: (i) the liquidity test (the Polish Guarantors will be deemed insolvent if it loses the ability to settle its due and payable liabilities, which will be presumed to be the case if the delay in payment exceeds three months, although this presumption will be rebuttable); or, for corporate debtors, (ii) the balance sheet test (the Polish Guarantors will be deemed insolvent if its pecuniary obligations exceed the value of its assets (the Polish Insolvency Law does not specify whether this relates to the market value or the book value)), provided that this situation status continues for longer than 24 months, and future liabilities (including liabilities subject to a suspensory condition) and shareholder loans will not be taken into account for this purpose. Nevertheless, the Polish court will be in a position to dismiss a bankruptcy petition even if the balance sheet test is met, if there is no threat to the Polish Guarantors’ ability to perform its due and payable obligations in the short term. If the Polish court is satisfied that the relevant substantive bankruptcy test is met, it will issue an order declaring the debtor bankrupt and nominating a trustee responsible for managing or supervising the Polish Guarantors’ assets during the bankruptcy proceedings. Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish Guarantors (whether alone or with others) is obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish Guarantor bankrupt within 30 days from when the grounds for declaration of bankruptcy above are met. In practice, it is difficult to determine the day from which 30 days’ time limit for filing the motion should be counted. If the assets of the debtor are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings or suffice only to cover those costs, the court will dismiss the bankruptcy petition. The court may also dismiss a petition where it has been established that the assets are encumbered by security (such as a mortgage or pledge) to such an extent that the residual assets are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings. However, the court will not order dismissal if it is established that the encumbrances on the debtor's assets are ineffective under the Polish Insolvency Law, or that they were created to the detriment of creditors, and further, if it is established that the debtor performed other acts, such as disposing of assets sufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings, which can potentially be set aside under the Polish Insolvency Law and, as an additional condition, if the circumstances of the case indicate that by applying the relevant provisions on the ineffectiveness and contesting of the debtor's acts, assets with a value in excess of the predicted costs will be obtained. Restructuring proceedings in relation to the Polish Guarantors may be initiated by a debtor that is insolvent (on the basis of the bankruptcy tests specified in the Polish Insolvency Law) or threatened with insolvency (the debtor is deemed to be threatened with insolvency if its economic situation shows that it may become insolvent in the short term). In the event of conflicting petitions for bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings, the Polish court will withhold the bankruptcy petition and the restructuring petition will be considered first (and if the restructuring petition is accepted, it will not be possible to declare the Polish Guarantors bankrupt as long as restructuring proceedings are pending). In exceptional cases, if withholding the bankruptcy petition was in conflict with the interest of all the creditors, the bankruptcy court could decide to consider both petitions at the same time. Provisions of any agreement which stipulate that such an agreement will be terminated and/or amended upon bankruptcy (or upon bankruptcy petition being filed) of one of the parties are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt entity is a party which hinder or prevent the objectives of the insolvency proceedings will be deemed ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy estate. Any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than Polish złoty, regardless of whether the claim has fallen due or not, if put on the list of claims, must be converted into Polish złoty at the average exchange rate of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) prevailing on the date on which the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor's bankruptcy and when there was no such rate - according to the average market price on that date. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy, 237 ----- creditors may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date of the decision of the bankruptcy court on the debtor's bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any proceeds of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency proceedings will be carried out through liquidation of the bankrupt debtor's assets. In insolvency proceedings, all creditors, whether secured or unsecured, wishing to assert claims against the debtor, need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Polish insolvency proceedings are in principle collective proceedings and creditors are barred from pursuing their individual claims separately. Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the relevant insolvency proceeding (lodging of claims) and will be paid on a pro rata basis out of the bankruptcy estate according to the categories of satisfaction provided by the Polish Insolvency Law. Creditors who have a security interest over the debtor's assets or any part thereof have priority rights under the governing law of the security interest and under the relevant provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law. In essence, secured creditors are not entitled to enforce such security interest outside the relevant insolvency proceeding. Creditors secured by a registered pledge may enforce their security interest directly by way of appropriation of such collateral if the pledge agreement provided for such a way of enforcement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A U.S. court would likely find that an Obligor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes offered hereby or the guarantees thereof if such Obligor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable guarantee. Given that the guarantees furnished by the U.S. Guarantors are upstream guarantees, there is a risk that a U.S. court may determine that one or more of such Guarantors did not receive reasonably equivalent value in return for entering into the guarantees. The Group cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not an Obligor was solvent at the relevant time. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending on the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent by a U.S. court if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; 245 ----- - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. In an _in limine ruling in the In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S._ Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to be a fraudulent transfer. If the Notes offered hereby or guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against any Obligor for amounts payable on the Notes or the guarantees would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by any Obligor. Although any guarantee entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes offered hereby will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor's obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. Any future pledges of collateral by an Obligor in favor of the holders of the Notes to secure the debt incurred thereby might similarly be subject to later challenge and potential avoidance as fraudulent transfers. In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a bankruptcy, claims in respect of liens or obligations evidenced by the Notes or guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy, subject to the rights of creditors and other parties in interest to object and seek relief from the bankruptcy court. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to: - the administration of a bankruptcy case, including (i) the imposition of the automatic stay, which immediately stays all litigation, as well as most enforcement and other actions against the debtors or property of the bankruptcy estate; (ii) provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors to protect against diminution of value of their collateral; (iii) terms for the use, sale or lease of property; (iv) standards for obtaining post-petition credit; and (v) rules regarding the treatment of executory contracts and unexpired leases; - creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority and allowance of claims, rights of secured creditors, and subordination of claims, including pursuant to principles of “equitable subordination”; and - the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and ability to bring turnover and avoidance actions, provisions relating to liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and the filing of ancillary and other cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor's assets by a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court and typically results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor's business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue to operate their business as a going concern while they reorganize their businesses and resolve their obligations to creditors (although a liquidation or sale under chapter 11 is also possible), in each case pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation, as applicable. Unlike in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor typically remains in possession of its assets and continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case (subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy court), with substantially the same rights that a trustee would otherwise have. In addition, ""liquidating"" chapter 11 cases may be used as an alternative to a liquidation under chapter 7, particularly where the conversion of a pending chapter 11 246 ----- case to a case under chapter 7 might prove prohibitively expensive or in an instance when the debtor seeks to sell all or substantially all of its assets free and clear of liens during the course of the bankruptcy case. Because bankruptcy proceedings are often fact specific and vary case-by-case, and because bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that could affect the Notes and/or the guarantees and security is not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction.

Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as a holder of Notes is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from taking any act to obtain possession of or exercise control over, property of the bankruptcy estate, including any act to create, perfect, or enforce a lien against property of the estate. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the Obligors could therefore prevent the holders of the Notes from obtaining possession of, or exercising control over, the Collateral, commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the Collateral, or perfecting any liens that were not properly perfected prior to the bankruptcy.

This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor's property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures. Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within the first 180 days of the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties such as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans. In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests; 247 ----- - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; or - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of ""adequate protection.""",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

If the Notes are not kept or administered in a custodial account, German withholding tax will nevertheless be levied if the Notes are issued as definitive securities and the savings income is paid by a German Disbursing Agent against presentation of the Notes or interest coupons (a so-called over-the-counter transaction – Tafelgeschäft). The tax base is, in principle, equal to the taxable gross income (i.e., prior to withholding). However, in the case of capital gains, if the custodial account has changed since the time of the acquisition of the Notes by the holder (e.g., if the Notes had been transferred from a non-EU custodial account prior to the sale) and the costs of the Notes are not proven to the German Disbursing Agent in the form required by law (e.g., in the case of over-the-counter transactions), withholding tax is applied to 30% of the proceeds from the redemption or sale of the Notes, unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a credit, financial services or securities institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or in certain other countries/territories, (e.g., the Swiss Confederation or the Principality of Andorra). When computing the tax base for withholding tax purposes, the German Disbursing Agent has to deduct any negative savings income (negative _Kapitalerträge) realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other_ securities with the exception of shares) or paid accrued interest (Stückzinsen) in the same calendar year or unused negative savings income of previous calendar years. Capital losses from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes held as private assets should generally be tax-recognized irrespective of the holding period of the Notes. The losses may, however, not be used to offset other income like employment or business income but may only be offset against investment income subject to certain limitations. Losses not utilized in one year may be carried forward into subsequent years but may not be carried back into preceding years. Losses arising from a full or partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Notes including a default of the Issuer, bad debt (Forderungsausfall) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of EUR 20,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of EUR 20,000 can be carried forward and might be set off in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of EUR 20,000 per year (“Limitation on Loss Deduction”). Given the Limitation on Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent holding the Notes in custody, investors suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare such losses in their income tax return. Although the relevant amount has been increased from EUR 10,000 to EUR 20,000, the constitutionality of the Limitation on Loss Deduction is still being debated. Therefore, investors affected by the Limitation on Loss Deduction are advised to seek individual tax advice. The German withholding tax will be levied by a German Disbursing Agent at a flat withholding tax rate of 25 (plus solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus, if applicable, church tax). Church tax, if applicable, will be collected by the German Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern). In the latter case, the investor has to include the savings income in the tax return and will then be assessed to church tax. Further, church tax is not 249 ----- collected by way of withholding if the investment income forms part of income from trade business, self-employment, agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing. No German withholding tax will be levied if the investor has filed a withholding tax exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the German Disbursing Agent, but only to the extent the savings income does not exceed the exemption amount shown on the withholding tax exemption certificate. Currently, the maximum exemption amount is EUR 1,000 (EUR 2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners). Similarly, no withholding tax will be levied if the investor has submitted a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the relevant local tax office to the German Disbursing Agent. Payments made to a holder resident in a so-called “non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives _Steuerhoheitsgebiet) should be subject to a tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a rate of 15% (plus solidarity_ surcharge) of the gross payment pursuant to the Defence against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze,_ “StAbwG”). However, pursuant to recently introduced legislation no withholding tax will be levied if bearer notes which are represented by a global note (Sammelurkunde) are held in collective safe custody with a central depositary or similar instrument are tradable on a recognized stock exchange. The exact scope of this exemption is, however, unclear. The Issuer is not obliged to levy German withholding tax in respect of payments on the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,557,TAXATION,557.1,Certain German Tax Considerations,557.1.2,Tax assessment,"The taxation of savings income shall take place mainly by way of levying withholding tax (please see above). If and to the extent German withholding tax has been levied, such withholding tax shall, in principle, become definitive and replace the investor's income taxation. If no withholding tax has been levied other than by virtue of a withholding tax exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) and in certain other cases, the investor is nevertheless obliged to file a tax return, and the savings income will then be taxed within the assessment procedure (Veranlagungsverfahren). If the investor is subject to church tax and has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern), the investor is also obliged to include the savings income in the tax return for church tax purposes. However, also in the assessment procedure, savings income is principally taxed at a separate tax rate for savings income (gesonderter Steuertarif für Einkünfte aus Kapitalvermögen) being identical to the withholding tax rate (26.375% - including solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) plus, if applicable, church tax). In certain cases, the investor may apply to be assessed on the basis of its personal tax rate if such rate is lower than the above-mentioned tax rate. Such application can only be filed consistently for all savings income within the assessment period. In case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners the application can only be filed for savings income of both spouses/life partners. When computing the savings income, the saver's lump sum amount (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of EUR 1,000 (EUR 2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners) will be deducted. The deduction of the actual income related expenses, if any, is excluded. That holds true even if the investor applies to be assessed on the basis of its personal tax rate. Where Notes form part of a trade or business, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder's applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income constitutes German source income in the form of income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German situs real estate, unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Globalurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibung), (iii) the income otherwise constitutes German-source income (such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs property or income from a hybrid instrument issued by a German tax resident issuer) or (iv) the income is attributable to an investor resident in a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsbegiet) which is mentioned on the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions and adopted in the German Defence against Tax Havens Act (including the German 250 ----- Tax Haven Defence Ordinance). Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over-the-counter transaction (Tafelgeschäft) by a German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements, a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The Issuer is subject to the so-called FATCA legislation which generally requires reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with FATCA and direct or indirect ownership by U.S. persons of non-U.S. entities. As part of the process of implementing FATCA, the U.S. government has negotiated intergovernmental agreements with certain foreign jurisdictions which are intended to streamline reporting and compliance requirements for entities established in such foreign jurisdictions and subject to FATCA. Luxembourg has entered into a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement implemented by the Luxembourg law of 24 July 2015, as amended or supplemented from time to time (the “FATCA Law”), which requires Financial Institutions located in Luxembourg to report, when required, information on Financial Accounts held by Specified U.S. Persons (as defined under the FATCA Law), if any, to the Luxembourg tax authorities (administration des contributions directes). Under the terms of the FATCA Law, the Issuer is treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial Institution. This status imposes on the Issuer the obligation to regularly obtain and verify information on all of the holders of Notes. On the request of the Issuer, each holder of Notes shall agree to provide certain information, including, in the case of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (“NFFE”), information on the Controlling Persons of such NFFE, along with the required supporting documentation. Similarly, each holder of Notes shall agree to actively provide to the Issuer within 30 days any information that would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address or a new residency address. The FATCA Law may require the Issuer to disclose the names, addresses and taxpayer identification number (if available) of the holders of Notes as well as information such as account balances, income and gross proceeds (nonexhaustive list) to the Luxembourg tax authorities for the purposes set out in the FATCA Law. Such information will be relayed by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if applicable, of the processing of their information by the Issuer. Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if necessary). Any data obtained by the Issuer is to be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation. Although the Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid imposition of FATCA withholding tax, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to satisfy these obligations. If the Issuer becomes subject to a withholding tax or penalties as result of the FATCA regime, the value of the Notes held by the holders of Notes may suffer material losses. The failure for the Issuer to obtain such information from each holder of Notes and to transmit it to the Luxembourg tax authorities may trigger the 30 per cent. withholding tax to be imposed on payments of U.S. source income as well as penalties. Any holder of Notes that fails to comply with the Issuer’s documentation requests may be charged with any taxes and/or penalties imposed on the Issuer as a result of such holder’s failure to provide the information and the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Notes of such holder of Notes.

This information, as exhaustively set out in Annex I of the CRS Law (the “Information”), will include personal data related to the Reportable Persons. The Issuer’s ability to satisfy its reporting obligations under the CRS Law will depend on each holder of Notes providing the Issuer with the Information, along with the required supporting documentary evidence. In this context, the holders of Notes are hereby informed that, as data controller, the Issuer will process the Information for the purposes as set out in the CRS Law. Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if applicable, of the processing of their Information by the Issuer. Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if necessary). Any data obtained by the Issuer are to be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation. The holders of Notes are further informed that the Information related to Reportable Persons will be disclosed to the Luxembourg tax authorities annually for the purposes set out in the CRS Law. The Luxembourg tax authorities will, under their own responsibility, eventually exchange the reported information to the competent authority of the Reportable Jurisdiction(s). In particular, Reportable Persons are informed that certain operations performed by them will be reported to them through the issuance of statements, and that part of this information will serve as a basis for the annual disclosure to the Luxembourg tax authorities. Similarly, the holders of Notes undertake to inform the Issuer within 30 days of receipt of these statements should any included personal data not be accurate. The holders of Notes further undertake to immediately inform the Issuer of, and provide the Issuer with all supporting documentary evidence of any changes related to the Information after occurrence of such changes.

A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method US holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis US holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a US holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such 256 ----- interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above-mentioned election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing US holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received) with respect to such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as US source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event the Notes are issued with OID, US holders of Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for US federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, US holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The amount of any OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a US holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such US holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated _Interest.”_ A US holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as US source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Any non-US withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a US holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for US federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). If a refund of any tax withheld is available under any applicable income tax treaty, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a US holder’s US federal income tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against US federal taxable income). Certain US Treasury regulations that apply to foreign income taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 restrict the availability of any such credit based on the nature of the tax imposed by the foreign 257 ----- jurisdiction, although the IRS has provided temporary relief from the application of certain aspects of these regulations until new guidance or regulations are issued.

A US holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such US holder, increased by any OID previously accrued by such US holder with respect to the Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant US holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such US holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a US holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis US holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis US holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis US holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the US holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis US holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute US source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be US source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the US holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest and accrued OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such US holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be US source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate US holders (including individuals) derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

US holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). US holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a US holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all US federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for US federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on the Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. No such final regulations defining foreign passthru payments have been issued as of the date hereof.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Such “prohibited transactions” include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions 260 ----- (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting life insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers). Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and the Issuer does not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes.

Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Laws.

Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel and advisors regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an _active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.” Each purchaser of the_ Notes, by its purchase of the Notes, will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors,” “Notice to EEA Investors” and “Notice to Certain Other Investors.” In connection with the offering, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (the “Stabilizing Manager”) (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering 271 ----- transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services (including, among others, hedging, financing, guarantee business, cash management and various other banking services and activities) to the Issuer and its affiliates, or to the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for the Transactions. In particular, the Initial Purchasers or certain of their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Super Senior Facilities, and such entities have received or will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Furthermore, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing RCF Facility Agreement and the Existing L/G Facility Agreement and have received or will receive customary fees for their services. Following the completion of the Offering, the Existing RCF Facility Agreement and the Existing L/G Facility Agreement will be cancelled in full and any outstanding utilizations thereunder will be repaid. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are, or will become, lenders under the super Senior Facilities Agreement and have received or will receive customary fees for their services. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views with respect to such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 272 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The sale will be made pursuant to an agreement among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers (the “Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, to purchase from the Issuer all of the Notes. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by the Issuer’s and their counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has furthermore agreed to reimburse the Initial Purchasers for certain expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have made certain representations and given certain warranties with respect to their respective legal and financial matters. The Initial Purchasers are entitled, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Purchase Agreement. In such event, no Notes will be delivered to investors. The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that it or its affiliates and subsidiaries will not, directly or indirectly, sell or offer to sell any securities substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 90 days from the date the Notes are issued without first obtaining the written consent of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange or that such listing will be maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the Holders, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of the Notes to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of the Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the US Securities Act and the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “US Exchange Act”). Accordingly, it cannot be assured that any market for the Notes will develop, or that such market will be liquid if it does develop, or that an investor will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable. Persons that purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price. Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, may not make sales of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they will do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law. The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act or qualified for sale under the securities laws of any US state or any jurisdiction outside the United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Accordingly, the Notes will be subject to significant restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors,” “Notice to EEA Investors,” “Notice to Certain Other Investors” and “Transfer _Restrictions.” Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker dealers who_ are registered as such under the US Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the US Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the US Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors); and 270 ----- - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

A substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or to enforce against it judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. In Luxembourg, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process upon the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantors incorporated and existing under Luxembourg law within Luxembourg in accordance with the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965. The United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. An enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the US securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter both under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and under applicable Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules and local law; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, or at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court); - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or has not been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature (which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such punitive damages may be considered as a penalty; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi _luxembourgeoise)._ Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no statutory prohibition to do so. If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona fide and (ii) if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy or is 273 ----- manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.2,Germany,23.2.1,,"The Issuer has been advised by its German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on US federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in US federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any US federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a US federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a US court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgements if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in Sections 723(2), 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) exist: - the judgment is final under US federal or state law; - if, pursuant to German law, the courts in the country of the court having rendered the foreign judgement did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; - if the judgement is incompatible with a prior judgement rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the proceeding resulting in the judgement to be recognized is incompatible with a previously pending (rechtshängig) proceeding in Germany; - if a recognition of the judgement would be obviously incompatible with fundamental principles of German law (order public), in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights under the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the courts of the country where the judgement was issued would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgement by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from US federal or state courts in Germany. The Issuer cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a US court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgements awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the US federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. German civil procedure differs substantially from US civil procedure in a number of aspects, including the possibilities for obtaining evidence. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, US federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor the final US federal or state judgement is rendered brings a new lawsuit in the same matter in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German courts the final judgement rendered in the 274 ----- United States. Under such circumstances, a judgement by a US federal or state court will be regarded by the German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgement relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgement that is not in line with the judgement rendered by the US federal or state court, but the latitude to deviate from the foreign judgment is limited. The German court is free to issue a completely new decision if there are grounds for non-recognition under 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, but must otherwise take the foreign decision into account (i.e., the foreign judgement has a certain binding effect). Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.3,Poland,23.3.1,,"The recognition and enforcement of judgments of foreign courts in Poland is subject to limitations (i) specified in the relevant EU laws (including in particular Council Regulation (EC) Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters if the judgment was issued in a Member State of the European Union); (ii) under international agreements, if a relevant bilateral/multilateral treaty provides for such enforcement (including in particular the Hague Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements); or (iii) on the basis of the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure if (i) and (ii) above do not apply. There is currently no treaty between the United States and Poland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, in such a case, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure apply. Under that procedure, any final and conclusive judgment against the Issuer or Guarantor with its registered office in Poland obtained in a court of the United States and arising out of or in relation to the obligations of the Issuer or Guarantors with its registered office in Poland, would be recognized ex lege in Poland, unless: - the judgment is not final and binding in the US; - the judgment was issued on an issue which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Polish courts (such as matters relating to real property located in Poland); - the defendant who has not entered the dispute as to the essence of the disputed issue has not been served the complaint in the manner enabling the defendant to defend himself; - a party was deprived of the ability to defend itself in the course of the proceeding; - proceedings related to the same claim between the same parties had been commenced in Poland before it was initiated in the US court; - the judgment is contrary to a previously issued final and binding judgment of a Polish court or of a foreign court judgment fulfilling the prerequisites for its recognition in Poland and was issued in proceedings related to the same claim between the same parties; or - the recognition of the judgment would be contrary to the fundamental principles of legal order of Poland (the public policy clause). Enforceability of any final and conclusive judgment against the Issuer or a given Guarantor with its registered office in Poland obtained in a court of the United States and arising out of or in relation to the obligations of the Issuer or Guarantors, further requires that a Polish court issues a decision confirming that given judgment of the US court is enforceable in Poland (which will be issued provided that given judgment is enforceable in the US and all the conditions referred to above are met). Once the motion to declare enforceability is considered and approved, the court issues a decision to grant an enforceability clause (klauzula wykonalności). Enforcement pursuant to such a decision may be initiated as soon as the decision granting the enforceability clause becomes final and binding. Finally, it should be noted that the enforcement actions conducted by the court executive officer (bailiff) may be challenged and, therefore, the enforcement of obligations sometimes may not be successful or may be lengthy, even if the US judgment is recognized and enforceable in Poland. 275 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In the following, Mangrove LuxCo III and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries is referred to as ""Mangrove Group"" or “the Group”. ----- ## 2. Reporting principles #### 2.1 Going-concern basis of accounting ###### Preparation of Condensed consolidated financial statements With effective date December 21, 2022, the Group agreed with the lenders to reset the financial covenants, to which the Actual 2023 met sufficient headroom. Based on the good start to the year in Q1 2024, management of the Group expects the financial performance for the full year to exceed budget. With current market conditions and business performance, the Group does not see any current risk to complying with future covenant requirements and consequently the management does not see any risk to the going concern of the Group. Based on actual Q1 2024 performance and current forward planning the Group anticipate they will currently be in the position to meet future financial obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
350_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.44,Refinancing process,27.44.1,,"The Group is in the process of refinancing all long-term financing instruments: Revolving Credit Facility, Senior Guarantee Facility, and bonds – which it started in May 2024. Completion of the refinancing is planned for Q3 2024. The management of the Group currently expects that the Group will be able to meet its covenants. Therefore, the Condensed consolidated financial statements of Group, for Q1 2024, have been prepared on a going-concern basis. #### 2.2 Basis of preparation Pursuant to clause 4.03(a)(2) of the Indenture, dated October 09, 2019, between the Company and GLAS Trustees Limited (as Trustee), Global Loan Agency Services Limited (as Paying Agent), GLAS SAS (as Registrar and Transfer Agent) and GLAS Trust Corporation Limited (as Security Agent) (the “Mangrove Notes Indenture”), the Company is required to set up Condensed consolidated Financial Statements. #### 2.3 Group accounting principles and methods This Condensed consolidated financial report ending 31 March 2024 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (“Interim Financial Reporting”), which governs interim financial reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, which are endorsed by the European Union, and the Interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) in effect at the reporting date. As these are Condensed consolidated financial statements, they do not include all the information required by IFRS for full consolidated financial statements at the end of a financial year. The comparable Condensed consolidated Statement of Financial Position refers to the consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2023. The comparable Condensed consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss Statement as well as the comparable Condensed consolidated Cash Flow Statement, refer to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Reference should be made as appropriate to the Notes to the consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2023, particularly with regard to the main recognition and measurement principles, except where financial reporting standards have been applied for the first time in 2024 or accounting principles have changed. Sales-related and cyclical items are accrued throughout the year, insofar as they are significant. The interim Financial Statements are prepared in euros (EUR). All amounts, including the comparative figures, are presented in thousands of euros (EUR thousand). Due to rounding, figures presented may result in differences of EUR 1 thousand in certain cases. ----- #### 2.4 Presentation of the condensed consolidated Financial Statements For information on presentation principles, estimates, assumptions, and significant judgements that have the greatest impact on the amounts recognised in these condensed consolidated statements for the period January 1 to March 31, 2024, please refer to corresponding explanations in consolidated Financial Statements of Mangrove Group as of December 31, 2023. #### 2.5 Accounting regulations applied for the first time in the year 2024 The following standards and amendments to existing standards of possible relevance to the Group, which were adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) which are effective since January 1 2024, have not been applied early, but are applied by the Group since start of the fiscal year 2024. - **Amendments to IAS 1 (Effective January 1, 2024) Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current: The amendments to IAS 1 only affect the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position. They clarify that a liability is classified as non-current if the entity has a substantive right at the reporting date to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. The mere existence of a substantial right is sufficient; the company does not have to intend to exercise this right. This change did not result in a significant effect on the Condensed consolidated financial statements. Non-current Liabilities with Covenants: The supplementary amendment to IAS 1 clarifies that if the right to defer payment is linked to the fulfilment of conditions that must be met within twelve months of the balance sheet date, these conditions have no influence on the classification as current or non-current. Extended disclosures on liabilities classified as non-current with covenants are required for risk assessment. This change did also not result in a significant change on the Condensed consolidated financial statements. - **Amendments to IFRS 16 (Effective January 1, 2024) Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback: The objective of the Amendments is to specify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to be accounted for as a sale. The lease liability must be measured in such a way that no gain or loss arises on subsequent measurement in relation to the retained right-of-use asset. There are no material effects on the Condensed consolidated financial statements. - **Amendments to IAS7 and IFRS7 (Effective January 1, 2024) Supplier Finance Arrangements: The amendments introduce two new disclosure objectives – one in IAS 7 and another in IFRS 7 – for a company to provide information about its supplier finance arrangements that would enable users (investors) to assess the effects of these arrangements on the company’s liabilities and cash flows, and the company’s exposure to liquidity risk. There are no material effects on the Condensed consolidated financial statements. #### 2.6 International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules The Mangrove Group has adopted ""International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules” (Amendments to IAS 12) upon their release on 23 May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure, which are addressed in section ""Income Taxes - Global minimum top-up tax"". ----- The mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted at the 31 March 2024, in any jurisdiction in which the Mangrove Group operates and no related deferred tax was recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the Mangrove Group 's Condensed consolidated financial statements. The Mangrove Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax - which is required to pay under Pillar Two legislation - is an income tax in the scope of IAS 12. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred. #### 2.7 Interim financial reporting principles These interim Financial Statements present a true and fair view of the Group's results of operations, financial position, and net assets in the reporting period. The preparation of interim Financial Statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the Group's assets, liabilities, provisions, and deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as its income and expenses. Although management makes such estimates and assumptions carefully and in good faith, actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in these interim Financial Statements. Factors that may cause amounts to fall below expectations include deterioration in the global economic situation, movements in exchange rates and interest rates, as well as material litigation and changes in environmental or other legislations and errors in internal operating processes. The loss of key customers and rising borrowing costs may also adversely affect the Group’s future performance. ## 3. Basis of consolidation As of March 31, 2024, the Mangrove Group comprises 4 companies domiciled in Luxembourg and 50 foreign companies (totalling 54 as at year-end). Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control is assumed, when the following three criteria are fulfilled: (1) the parent company holds decision-making power over the relevant activities of the investee, (2) the company has rights to variable returns from the investee and (3) the parent company can use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns. The fulfilment of these criteria is assessed based on corporate governance and potential supplementary agreements. Companies that are dormant or do not have significant impact on the financial position and results of operation of the Group are not included in the Condensed consolidated financial statements. A total of two companies are not consolidated. The aggregate assets, equity, revenues, and earnings of these companies are not material to the Condensed consolidated financial statements. The subsidiaries are recognised at cost as non-current other financial assets. Management deems the influence to the Group as absolutely insignificant and hence, the disclosure required under IFRS has not been made due to materiality reason. The disclosure of this information is not suitable to communicate additional information. ## 4. Financial Covenants The Group has entered into the following financing agreements in the course of financing the acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group: - € 65,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (“RCF”, “RCF Facility Agreement”) ----- - € 260,000,000 Senior Guarantee Facility Agreement (“SGF”, “SGF Facility Agreement”) - € 234,921,656.23 Cash Collateral Loan Agreement (“Cash Cover Loan Agreement”) - € 84,640,713.21 Multilateral Guarantee Facility Agreement (“MGFA”) - €356,233,492 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes The RCF Facility Agreement, the SGF (together, the “Facilities”), the Cash Cover Loan Agreement and the MGFA were entered into by the Company as parent and certain of its subsidiaries (as borrowers and guarantors). On May 27, 2020, the process of refinancing the Group’s guarantee and “Letter of Credit” portfolio was completed, and the associated cash cover loan was fully repaid. With effective date December 21, 2022, the Group agreed with the lenders to reset the financial covenants set forth in the facility agreements and make certain additional amendments including, but not limited to, a reduction of the total commitments under and as defined in the SGF from EUR 260 million to EUR 190 million. The amended Facilities provide for the following financial covenants: a) **Minimum EBITDA[1]** – (consolidated EBITDA (normalized Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization) as defined in the RCF Facility Agreement) - the Group shall be required to meet a minimum amount of EBITDA in respect of each relevant period. The minimum EBITDA covenant amount is €72,600,000 (the Minimum EBITDA Amount, as amended) as of March 31, 2024. b) **Total net leverage – the Group shall be required not to exceed a certain leverage ratio in respect of each relevant period (such ratio based on consolidated total net debt (i.e., the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents minus financial indebtedness of the Group as defined in the RCF Facility Agreement) to consolidated EBITDA). The total required net leverage ratio covenant (as amended) is 5.30 as of March 31, 2024. c) **Minimum liquidity – the Group shall be required to provide reporting on its liquidity (i.e., freely available cash and cash equivalents as defined by the RCF Facility Agreement). If liquidity is less than €25,000,000 (but equal to, or greater than €20,000,000), a “Soft Minimum Liquidity Breach” shall occur. If liquidity is less than €20,000,000 a “Hard Minimum Liquidity Breach” shall occur. The financial covenants set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be tested on a quarterly basis. The minimum liquidity set out in paragraph (c) shall be tested on a monthly basis. As of March 31, 2024, the Group complied with all financial covenants as set out above. According to the financing agreements the Facilities mature on the date falling four years from the date of acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group (i.e., October 8, 2023), subject to an automatic one-year extension (i.e., October 9, 2024). The extension occurs provided that the annual financial statements delivered by the Issuer for the period ending December 31, 2023, do not contain any qualification as to the ability of the New Group to continue as a going concern (unless that qualification arises as a result of the RCF maturing on the Original Termination Date). As the annual financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2023, did not contain such qualification, which was reported to the Agent of the Facilities on 12 June 2023. In Q1 2024 the maturity of the facilities had been extended to June 9[th], 2025. The interest rates have been increased by 0,5%. ## 5. Financial risk management As a global Group, Mangrove Group is in its normal course of business exposed to various financial risks such as liquidity, currency, interest rate, procurement prices, and credit risks that could affect its net assets, financial position, and results of operations. It is the company’s policy to use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risks associated with operating 1 EBITDA LTM – last twelve months, for Q1 2024 it’s a period from April 01, 2023, till March 31, 2024 ----- activities and the resulting financing requirements. The Group does not invest in derivatives for trading purposes. The various risks and the current exposure have not significantly changed compared to the risks described within Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Mangrove Group as of December 31, 2023 (we refer to page 66 of the Consolidated Financial Statements 2023 of the Group). ## 6. Capital reserve Based on the shareholder resolution dated March 11, 2020, the sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à. r.l. contributed EUR 140,000,000 to the capital contribution account (account 115 “apport en capitaux propres non rémunéré par des titres” of the Luxembourg Standard Chart of Accounts) of the Company. Pursuant to a shareholder resolution as of December 22, 2020, the Company’s sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à. r.l. acknowledged to convert an aggregated amount of EUR 136,528,353 into tracking preferred equity certificates (“TPECs”). The Company issued 13,652,835,300 TPECs, holding a value of EUR 0.01 each, representing a total issue of EUR 136,528,353. The subscription of the TPECs was dated December 31, 2020. Following the TPECs issuance and as part of the required security package in relation to certain facilities agreements entered into by the Company (including a EUR 65 million revolving facility, a EUR 190 million facilities agreement and a senior secured note indenture), the Company granted the TPECs pledge to the benefit of the Security Agent and entered into the TPECs pledge agreement for the purpose thereof. The capital reserve as of March 31, 2024, amounts to EUR 3,471,647 (as of December 31, 2023: EUR 3,471,647). ## 7. Tracking preferred equity certificates / Shareholder loan The company acquired Galapagos BidCo Group on October 9, 2019. Financing of the acquisition was done inter alia by a bridge loan of EUR 140,000 thousand provided to the Company by the indirect shareholder Mangrove LuxCo I S. à r.l. on October 9, 2019. The final maturity date for the loan is four years after the date of the transaction, i.e., October 8, 2023. The loan does not accrue interest for the first six months after the transaction date. After the transaction date Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l. transferred the loan agreement and the EUR 140.000.000 loan receivable to its subsidiary Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l. which is the sole shareholder of the Company. On March 11, 2020, Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l. contributed the loan receivable in the full amount of EUR 140,000 thousand to the capital contribution account (account 115 “apport en capitaux proprex non rémunéré par des titres” of the Luxembourg Standard Chart of Accounts) of the Company. With Shareholder resolution as of December 22, 2020, the sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l. to convert an aggregated amount of EUR 136,528.353 thousand into tracking preferred equity certificates (“TPECS”). The company issued 13,652,835,300 TPECS, having a value of EUR 0.01 each, representing a total issue of EUR 136,528.353 thousand. As of March 31, 2024, TPECs are recognized at EUR 173,410.429 thousand including an interest of EUR 2,829.929 thousand (March 31, 2023: EUR 2,798.831 thousand). Following the TPECs issuance and as security package in relation to certain facilities agreements entered into by the Company (including a EUR 65 million revolving facility, a EUR 190 million facilities agreement and a senior secured note indenture), the Company granting the TPECs Pledge to the benefit of the Security Agent and entered into the TPECs Pledge Agreement for the purpose thereof. These TPECs are junior to all other debt of the Group and cannot be withdrawn by the shareholder under the existing financing agreements. Therefore, these TPECs are equity like instruments and are being disclosed in the Condensed consolidated Statement of Financial Position of the Group between equity and liabilities and are summed up together with the equity to the line item “Equity and tracking preferred equity certificates / shareholder loan”. ----- ## 8.

In those markets, the Group services a broad, diversified, and long-standing customer base in more than 130 countries. ##### 1.4 Segment Reporting Mangrove Group operates through the four Kelvion segments, “Refrigeration Technologies” (“RT”), “Machine Cooling Systems” (“MCS”), “Plate Heat Exchangers” (“PHE”) and “Thermal Solutions” (“KTS”). ##### 1.5 The four segments of Mangrove Group The four segments of Mangrove Group focus on distinct technologies and product portfolios: - **Refrigeration Technologies (RT) focuses on component business for refrigeration applications with significant growth potential in the data center industry. RT supplies a wide range of standard and customized heat exchangers for cooling and removing heat from different types of data centers (hyperscale, colocation, modular etc.) using both air and liquid cooling methods. The data center market consists of cooling solutions such as air conditioning, chilling units, economizer systems, liquid cooling systems, control systems and includes services such as consulting, installation & deployment and maintenance and support. The heat exchanger solutions are also used in the refrigeration market in cold chain warehouses, supermarkets, non-residential buildings, and industrial production. Product offering includes air cooled condensers which reject heat from refrigeration systems and are often sold as part of a package of equipment with air coolers. RT’s customized air coolers are design-to-order units for industrial or OEM solutions for food processing and distribution facilities. Product offering includes also customized radiators and dry coolers which are mainly used for power and industrial applications. Improving the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment is essential for end users looking to reduce carbon footprint and operating costs. - **Machine Cooling Systems (MCS) is a leading player in heat exchangers for power and engine applications with substantial growth opportunities by leveraging its global installed base. MCS supplies heat exchangers for power generation, power transmission, large engine applications (marine and off-highway) and green applications like biomass, green hydrogen, or renewable energies. The business is mostly with OEM, e.g., for large engine manufacturers, but MCS also engages in smaller projects, like solar, wind or solar photovoltaic. Product offering includes charge air coolers, which cool down combustion-air coming from the turbocharger before entering the engine. MCS’ shell and tube double safety heat exchangers assure the secure handling of safety-critical media. Product offering also includes box coolers which are fitted in the sea chest of small and medium-sized vessels. - **Thermal Solutions (KTS), is Kelvion’s largest segment, focusing on project business for demanding applications in the Oil & Gas, Chemicals Industries and, like RT, with significant growth potential in high tech data center business as well as green tech applications such as hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). KTS’ engineering expertise plays a key role in differentiation against competitors. High degree of geographical diversification with sites in all key region, including Europe, NAFTA, Latin America, China and MEA. Product offering includes air fin coolers typically used for very large cooling requirements in different industries, e.g., Oil & Gas and Chemicals, as well as air dryers which are used to remove humidity from an air stream in various process industries. KTS’ shell & tube heat exchangers are used to heat, cool, or condense water and other media in different process industries. The focus of the BU has shifted in the recent years from Oil & Gas and Petrochemicals to high and green tech business. ----- - **Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) provides a broad range of plate heat exchangers for a wide variety of applications in terms of pressure and temperature demands for a wide range of customer industries, ranging from HVAC and Refrigeration to Food & Beverages, Chemicals, Power, and Industrials. Product offering includes fully welded plate heat exchangers which are used to save energy in demanding high pressure and temperature applications, as well as brazed plate heat exchangers, often used for environmentally friendly heat pump applications. PHE’s gasketed heat exchangers have the highest efficiency and flexibility and are used in a variety of industries as well as for heat recovery applications. In contrast to the project driven segment KTS, the three segments RT, MCS and PHE represent the component type business of the Group and form together “Kelvion Products” (“KP”). All four segments hold strong favorable market positions in their respective markets. MCS and PHE are among the TOP 3, RT amongst the Top 5 and KTS is niche-market leader. In addition to the above segments there is the fifth Service segment, which is a virtual segment, i.e., Service is not separated from the four segments but managed globally and centrally across segments. ----- ### 2.

All IFRS Accounting standards and interpretations in effect for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, have been applied. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro (EUR), the functional currency of the group, and presented in thousand of euros (EUR thousand) or in millions of euros (EUR million). Due to rounding, figures presented may result in differences of EUR 1 thousand in certain cases. To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement have been aggregated and are explained accordingly in the Notes. Assets and liabilities are classified into current and non-current items. Current assets are expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period and current liabilities are due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period. The consolidated income statement is prepared using the cost of sales method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method for cash flows from operating activities and the direct method for cash flows from investing and financing activities. The accounting and measurement principles are presented and explained in detail in note 2.8. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Managers on April 15, 2024. ##### 2.3 First-time adoption of new accounting pronouncements The Group applied for the first time all standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2023. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group is not significant. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendments that were ----- issued but are not yet effective. ##### 2.3.1 Accounting regulations applied for the first time in the year 2023 - **Amendments to IFRS 17 (Effective January 1, 2023) IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts replaces IFRS 4 and for the first time sets out standard requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Under the IFRS 17 measurement model, groups of insurance contracts are measured based on the expected value of discounted cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risks as well as a contractual service margin that results in the recognition of profit in line with the provision of services. The amendments add a transition option aimed to improve the usefulness of comparative information presented on initial application of both IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 and introduce the option of applying a ""classification overlay approach"". This option can be applied when IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 are applied simultaneously for the first time and no ""restatement"" of a financial asset with regard to the comparative information of IFRS 9 in 2022 is made. - **Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 (Effective January 1, 2023) Disclosure of Accounting Policies: The amendment to IAS 1 requires that only ""material"" accounting policies are presented in the notes instead of significant accounting policies. It clarifyies that accounting policies related to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions are themselves immaterial and do not need to be disclosed; and that not all accounting policies relating to material transactions, other events or conditions are themselves material. The amendments to Practice Statement 2 accordingly indicate how the concept of materiality is applied to the disclosure of accounting policies. - **Amendments to IAS 8 (Effective January 1, 2023) Definition of Accounting Estimates: The amendments clarify how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates, taking into account that changes in accounting policies are applied retrospectively, whereas changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively. The changes to IAS 8 focus entirely on accounting estimates and clarify the definition of a change in accounting estimates by introducing a new definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, acounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. - **Amendments to IAS 12 (Effective January 1, 2023) Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction: The amendment restricts the exemption from (initial) recognition of deferred taxes to the extent that it no longer applies to transactions in which companies recognise both an asset and a liability (for example, leases and asset retirement obligations). Deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognised for such transactions in future, insofar as deductible and taxable temporary differences of the same amount arise. - **Amendments to IAS 12 (International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules) The KELVION group has adopted ""International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules” ----- (Amendments to IAS 12) upon their release on 23 May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure, which are addressed in section ""Income Taxes - Global minimum top-up tax"". The mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted at 31 December 2022, in any jurisdiction in which the KELVION group operates and no related deferred tax was recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the KELVION group 's consolidated financial statements. ##### 2.3.2 Accounting regulations not applied in advance of their effective date The following standards and amendments to existing standards of possible relevance to the Group, which were adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) but are not yet mandatory, have not been applied early: - **Amendments to IAS 1 (Effective January 1, 2024) Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current: The amendments to IAS 1 only affect the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position. They clarify that a liability is classified as non-current if the entity has a substantive right at the reporting date to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. The mere existence of a substantial right is sufficient; the company does not have to intend to exercise this right. Significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are not expected. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, the date of initial application was postponed to 1 January 2024. Non-current Liabilities with Covenants: The supplementary amendment to IAS 1 clarifies that if the right to defer payment is linked to the fulfilment of conditions that must be met within twelve months of the balance sheet date, these conditions have no influence on the classification as current or non-current. Extended disclosures on liabilities classified as non-current with covenants are required for risk assessment. No material effects on the consolidated financial statements are expected. - **Ammendments to IFRS 16 (Effective January 1, 2024) Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback: The objective of the Amendments is to specify how a seller lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to be accounted for as a sale. The lease liability must be measured in such a way that no gain or loss arises on subsequent measurement in relation to the retained right-of-use asset. The Amendments become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, with earlier application permitted. No material effects on the consolidated financial statements are expected. These new standards and amendments to existing standards will be applied by the Group starting in fiscal 2024 or later. ##### 2.4 Accounting pronouncements not yet endorsed by the EU The IASB issued the following standards and amendments to existing standards of relevance to the Group, which still have to be adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) before they become applicable: ----- - **Amendments to IAS 21 (Effective January 1, 2025) Lack of Exchangeability: The amendment clarifies how to specify when a currency is exchangeable into another currency and how a company estimates a spot rate when a currency lacks exchangeability (e.g. due to government directives). A currency is exchangeable when an entity is able to exchange that currency for the other currency through markets or exchange mechanisms that create enforceable rights and obligations without undue delay at the measurement date and for a specified purpose. A currency is not exchangeable into the other currency if an entity can only obtain an insignificant amount of the other currency. When a currency is not exchangeable, a company needs to estimate a spot rate. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Earlier application is permitted. Significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are not expected. - **Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 (Effective January 1, 2024) Supplier Finance Arrangements: The amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements for companies that enter into these arrangements. They do not change the classification and presentation of the related liabilities and cash flows. The amendments relate to disclosure requirements in connection with supplier financing arrangements (supply chain financing, trade payables financing or reverse factoring arrangements) and include - disclosures on terms and conditions of those financing arrangements, - the amounts of the liabilities that are the subject of such agreements, - for which part of these arrangements the suppliers have already received payments from the financiers, - under which item these liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet, - maturity date ranges and - information on liquidity risk. The amendments are to be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024, but for the Group only after corresponding EU endorsement. Significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are not expected. ##### 2.5 Basis of consolidation",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

As described in more detail in section “9.3 Litigations”, the purported administrator of Galapagos S.A. (“GSA”), Luxembourg (former 100 percent shareholder of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., “GBG"") brought a claim in Luxembourg against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. (Mangrove) and GBG. An _ex parte order of the Luxembourg Court was granted on November 27, 2019 at the request of the purported administrator of GSA placing the shares of GBG in escrow and appointing a Luxembourg based law firm as escrow trustee (the Trustee). The Escrow Order has as its primary purpose the preservation of the GBG shares as an asset, primarily by preventing an actual or de facto liquidation of GBG, pending separate determination of the main proceedings brought by GSA (which contest the transfer of the shares in GBG under a Luxembourg ----- pledge enforcement). This escrow order was successfully appealed and set aside by the Luxembourg Court. This decision was then appealed by the purported administrator, but this appeal was rejected by the Court. A further appeal has been lodged by the purported administrator to the Luxembourg Cour de cassation which overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision. The matter was referred back to the Luxembourg Court of Appeal to consider the position on the merits but was dismissed. The consequence of these various actions is that there is no escrow order in place. Finally, the administrator has brought a separate action challenging the 2021 restructuring of the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This action raises similar allegations to those made in the claw back action. The Luxembourg Court has yet to order a timetable for Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l’ to file their defence. Following an application of the purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., the District Court of Düsseldorf, Germany, has issued an injunction (einstweilige Verfügung) against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., ordering an escrow agent to hold the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This order was successfully appealed and, consequently, the injunction was lifted in June 2021. Further, by the same plaintiff, a main proceeding (Hauptsacheverfahren) has been initiated against inter alios Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. A first hearing took place in February 2023 with a decision announced for May 2023 (reference is made to section “9.3 Litigations”). The intention of the Escrow Order is not to interfere with the ordinary course of business of GBG or of the Group and as such where matters are in the ordinary course of business and the Trustee is requested to vote the GBG Shares to approve such actions. Therefore, the Company as the parent company holds (1) decision-making power over the relevant activities of GBG, (2) has rights to variable returns from the investee and (3) can use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns. Furthermore, the imposition of the Escrow Order has been contested by Mangrove. ###### Interests in associated companies and joint ventures Associated are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but no control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joined control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Interests in associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and at cost in case the company is not material. They are initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of profit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases for those that are accounted at equity. Two associated companies are accounted at cost since they are not material. Management deems the influence of the associated companies to the financial position of the Group as insignificant. ----- #### 2.7 Currency translation The Mangrove Group companies prepare their annual financial statements on the basis of their respective functional currencies. Foreign currency transactions entered into by companies included in the consolidated financial statements are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the applicable exchange rate at each reporting date. Exchange rate gains and losses resulting from these items are generally reported in the income statement under other income or expenses. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical acquisition or production cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as of the date when the fair value was determined. All financial statements of companies whose functional currencies differ from the reporting currency are translated into the reporting currency used in the consolidated financial statements. The assets and liabilities of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are translated at the middle rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income statements of these companies are translated at the average rates for the period under review.

The percentage-of-completion is determined using the cost-to-cost method, which is derived from the ratio of contract costs incurred to the total estimated contract costs as of the reporting date. Contract costs include direct costs plus materials and construction overheads, depreciation, production-related administrative costs, and such other costs that are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the contract. Adjustments are made for variations in contract work, claims, and incentive payments insofar as these will probably result in revenue that is capable of being reliably estimated. Changes in estimates or differences between the estimated cost and the actual cost have a direct ----- impact on recognised earnings from construction contracts. In addition, estimation limits must be observed. In line with this method, construction contracts are measured at the amount of the contract costs incurred as of the reporting date plus the profit attributable to the proportion of work completed. The costs incurred and the related profits are reported under contract assets, less progress billings and advance payments received or due. If, while a performance obligation is being satisfied, the contract costs incurred are not proportionate to the progress of the performance of said contract, revenues will be recognised only to the extent of the contract costs incurred (“zero-profit-method”). A profit is only recognised when the contract costs incurred are matched by corresponding progress of the performance of the contract. Contract costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. If it is foreseeable that total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an impending loss according to IAS 37. - Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when such goods are transferred to the customer, or when services were carried out, and the contractual performance obligations are therefore met. Performance obligations are satisfied as the customer obtains control over the goods sold to them, i.e., when they can direct the use of and obtain essentially all the remaining benefits from the goods. - Revenue from service agreements is recognised over the period in which the service is performed. If only the sale of spare parts is involved, revenue is recognised at a specific point in time. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received. Customer bonuses, discounts, or rebates reduce the amount of revenue recognised.

The amount of such payments is calculated at contract inception using the “expected-value” method if there are several different possible amounts - or the “most likely amount” method - if there are just two possible amounts. The effects of significant financing components can be ignored when determining the amount of revenue to be recognised if the vendor expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and the date of payment will be one year or less. Discretion must be applied when judging whether revenues are to be recognised “over time”, as well as with regard to the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation.

Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the heat exchanger industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services, current replacement costs, prices paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in circumstances, which indicate that an impairment exists. The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant judgements concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows, applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values. The carrying amounts of intangible assets, items of property, plant and equipment, and groups of cash generating units with goodwill are reviewed if they are likely to have been impaired by events or changes in circumstances. In addition, indefinite-lived intangible assets and cash-generating units with goodwill are tested for impairment at least once a year. The impairment test compares the asset’s carrying amount against its recoverable amount ( “impairment test”) . The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs of disposal ( net realisable value) . An estimate of fair value less costs to sell is only required if the value in use is less than the carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognised. In this case, the impairment loss is first deducted from the goodwill of the cash- generating unit with goodwill. Any amount exceeding goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non- current non financial assets. Fair value less costs of disposal is generally the benchmark for measuring the impairment of segments classified as “held for sale”. The valuations of other intangible assets, which were performed as part of the impairment test, are based on management assumptions. Previously recognised impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer apply, except in the case of goodwill. Impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortised historical cost. In total, impairments including reversal amounting to EUR 207 thousand for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were to be recorded in FY 2023 (2022: EUR 3,144 thousand).

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month (a) ECLs debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; (b) and other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when (a) the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: (a) significant financial difficulty of the debtor or it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. The Group recognises loss allowances for ECLs on financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI and contract assets. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month (a) ECLs debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; (b) and other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when (a) the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: (a) significant financial difficulty of the debtor or it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Any deviations may have an impact on the level of tax liabilities or deferred taxes in the year of the decision. When assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management judges the extent to which realisation of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently likely. The question of whether the deferred tax assets can actually be realised depends on whether sufficient future taxable income can be generated against ----- which the temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards can be offset. Management therefore analyses the times at which the deferred tax liabilities reverse, and expected future taxable income. Management forecasts whether deferred tax assets can be realised on the basis of expected future taxable income. Deferred tax assets decline if the estimate of planned taxable income decreases, tax benefits available as a result of tax strategies are reduced, or the amount or timing of future tax benefits is restricted by changes in law (see Note 6.7). IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 when there is uncertainty about the income tax treatment. For recognition and measurement, estimates and assumptions must be made, e.g. whether an estimate is made separately or together with other uncertainties, a most likely amount or expected amount for the uncertainty is used and whether changes have occurred compared to the previous period.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the end of the fiscal year and whenever there is any indication of a potential impairment. The units to which the goodwill is allocated represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other (groups of) assets and the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. In the Mangrove Group, the 4 CGU-segments are coming from four business units Refrigeration Technologies, Machine Cooling Systems, Kelvion Thermal Solutions and Plate Heat Exchangers. The goodwill arose from the acquisition of the Galapagos BidCo Group on October 9, 2019. Goodwill primarily derives from future growth that is expected with new customers and new technological developments.

The goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2023 leads to no impairment, as the recoverable amounts of the segments are higher than the carrying amount of the respective segment assets. The net cash inflows are discounted at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt capital. To account for the different risk and return profiles of the Mangrove Group’s principal businesses, the after-tax cost of capital is calculated separately for each unit and a specific capital structure is defined by benchmarking against comparable companies in the same industry sector. The cost of equity corresponds to the return expected by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the conditions on which comparable companies can obtain long-term financing. Both components are derived from capital market information. The value in use is based on the following key assumptions: For the period beyond the detailed planning horizon, cash flows are based on an extrapolation using a growth rate of 1.00 percent (FY 2022: 1.50 percent). This underlying growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth for the markets in which the segments operate. The CGU-specific total cost of capital assumed for discounting is based on a risk-free long-term interest rate of 2.75 percent and a market risk premium of 6.68 percent. Additionally, beta factors, a borrowing risk premium as well as capital structures were derived from a peer group for each cash-generating unit. Also, unit-specific tax rates were applied.

The defined benefit pension plan obligations mainly exist in Germany. Mangrove Group grants old-age, disability, and survivors’ benefits to many of its employees. New employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions. As part of the general benefits provided all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their compensation. Under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of up to 100 percent of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit. A corresponding collective bargaining agreement was entered by the predecessors of the Group in 2002 and revised in 2008. The new pension plan beginning in January 2019 does not only provide for pension payments, but also capital payments and installment payments. The post-retirement benefits are adjusted by minimum of 1 percent each year, according to the occupational retirement act (§ 16 Betriebsrentengesetz). In 2023 post-retirement benefits are adjusted by 2.1 percent. In addition to the currently open benefit schemes, there are a number of historical pension schemes in the company. These schemes are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for employees who were members at the time the scheme was closed. The pension liabilities are partly covered by reinsurance policies. All liabilities were actuarially valued as of December 31, 2023. Mangrove Group views granting pension benefits as an opportunity to foster employee loyalty and engagement. It is therefore an integral part of the remuneration concept and has an appropriate employee contribution component. In connection with this, Mangrove Group observes developments on the human resources market and regularly checks that the benefits it grants are appropriate and in line with the market. Mangrove Group does not believe that the pension liabilities pose any risks over and above the customary extent and the general risks described above. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

These assumptions are used to calculate the net pension expenses in the following year: (Percent) **12/31/2023** **12/31/2022 Discount factor 3.0 4.0 Inflation 2.0 2.0 derived: wage and salary increase rate 3.0 3.0 derived: pension increase rate 2.0 2.0 The actuarial measurement factors for German pension plans are established by Mangrove Group in consultation with actuarial experts. The corresponding assumptions for the few pension plans outside Germany are determined taking into account country-specific conditions. The discount rate is established using a recognized method based on the return on high quality corporate bonds determined as of the reporting date, taking into account the currency and maturities of the underlying liabilities. All other assumptions correspond to the long-term expectations of Mangrove Group. The nominal rate of wage and salary increases is calculated based on expected inflation and a real rate of increase. The rate of pension increases in Germany is also determined based on inflation, provided that the pension adjustments are determined in accordance with the rise in the cost of living. If a firm pension adjustment commitment has been made, this is taken into account accordingly. On 4 October 2018, Heubeck AG published new mortality tables (Heubeck mortality tables 2018G), for the valuation of all German plans as at 31 December 2023, these tables are used. On this basis, the life expectancy of a 65-year-old pensioner as of the reporting date is 21.63 years for men and 24.97 years for women. The sensitivities presented below were applied to the discount rate and inflation, which have been identified as actuarial assumptions that have a significant influence on Mangrove Group’s benefit obligations. Since the wage and salary increase rate and the pension increase rate are derived from inflation, sensitivity to inflation was used to measure the sensitivity of these assumptions together. The same calculation methods were used for sensitivities as for the recognized provisions. The ranges used to compute the sensitivities of the assumptions are based on the changes that are deemed possible until the next reporting date, given historical experience. The meaningfulness of historical experience for forecasts of future outcomes and neglecting to update a number of assumptions simultaneously may represent limitations of these methods. An increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate decreases the present value of the defined benefit obligation by 6.12 percent. If the assumed inflation rate declines by 25 basis points, the present value of the defined benefit obligation decreases by 0.18 percent. As of the relevant reporting date, the following weighted actuarial assumptions were used to calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligation relating to pension plans. These assumptions are used to calculate the net pension expenses in the following year: (Percent) **12/31/2022** **12/31/2021 Discount factor 3.7 1.0 Inflation 2.2 1.8 derived: wage and salary increase rate 3.2 2.8 derived: pension increase rate 2.2 1.0 The actuarial measurement factors for German pension plans are established by Mangrove Group in consultation with actuarial experts.

Regarding Tracking preferred equity certificates / shareholder loan we refer to note “5.2 Tracking preferred equity certificates / shareholder loan”. The carrying amount of the trade payables and other current liabilities that are subject to the measurement rules of IFRS 9 corresponds to their fair value. The fair value of fixed-interest liabilities is the present value of their expected future cash flows. They are discounted at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. The carrying amount of variable-rate liabilities corresponds to their fair value. The fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives are calculated using quoted exchange rates and yield curves observable in the market. Accordingly, they are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of senior secured notes is categorized within Level 1. Fair Value is calculated according to its quoted (unadjusted) price in active market. The fair value of other financial assets of shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments is measured on the basis of available financial information, such as transaction prices for financing rounds or business plans to the extent that this information is reliable, or, as an approximation, as cost, which is considered an appropriate estimate of fair value as no more suitable information is available. A review is carried out on a quarterly basis using all information available on the equity investments to establish whether cost is still representative of fair value. This would not be the case, for example, in the event of a significant change in the market in which the equity investments are active. As cost is the sole input factor for fair value, a percentage change in cost results in an equal change in fair value. The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) with any increase (decrease) in cost. A 1% increase (decrease) would not materially affect fair value.

On October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. acquired the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. as described elsewhere in these notes (e.g. chapter “1.2 Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries and successful Refinancing on October 9, 2019”), associated preferred equity certificates and any intercompany payables owed by Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to its former parent company Galapagos S.A. The acquisition was made in connection with the Restructuring, which was completed on October 9, 2019. A number of sets of internationally recognized advisors were involved in the Restructuring and latest decisions show that the Restructuring was fully legally effective and complied with all obligations, including under the applicable finance documents. The following claims have been brought which arise out of the Restructuring: - Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. had commenced proceedings in England against inter alios the Security Trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement which effected the Restructuring, the trustee which held rights on behalf of the Galapagos Senior Notes and each of the plaintiffs in the New York, German and Luxembourg proceedings described below, requesting that the English Court makes a series of declarations inter alia that the Restructuring complied with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The English proceedings do not contain any claim for damages. On 28 July 2023 the English Court issued its judgment, ruling in favour of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., by confirming that the Restructuring complied with the Intercreditor Agreement. The decision is legally binding. This is closed now. - A claim in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a beneficial holder of the Galapagos Senior Notes (“NY Claimant”) against inter alios Galapagos Holding (former indirect parent of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) and certain of its subsidiaries (now being subsidiaries of Mangrove Group) relating to the Restructuring. The plaintiff alleged that the Restructuring wrongly deprived it of value by diverting assets away from the Group and releasing certain guarantees. The plaintiff ssought: (i) damages; and (ii) a reversal of the steps taken to affect the Restructuring. In addition, the plaintiff sought a declaration that the release of liabilities under the Galapagos Senior Notes Indenture pursuant to the provisions of the former Intercreditor Agreement applying to certain liabilities of the Group was invalid (in other words, that this part of the Restructuring also be reversed). The Supreme Court of the State of New York decided on 22 July 2020 to stay this action pending a decision from the English Court as to its jurisdiction in these matters (as referred to above). Following the decision of the English Court on 28 July 2023, the NY Claimant agreed to a joint stipulation regarding the dismissal of its claim with prejudice, i.e., the dismissal is legally binding on all parties. This is closed now. - On October 31, 2019 main insolvency proceedings were opened over the assets of Galapagos S.A. in Düsseldorf, Germany. Two appeals were lodged at the German Federal Supreme Court on ----- the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf insolvency court. Following such appeals, on December 17, 2020, the German Federal Court of Justice referred certain legal questions concerning matters of European insolvency law (and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf court in such insolvency proceedings) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for determination. The Court of Justice of the European Union rendered its decision on 24 March 2022, which confirmed that the German courts did not have authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019, given that the European regime applied to the UK at this time. Following this decision, on 30 June 2022 the English insolvency court made a winding-up order with regard to Galapagos S.A. and has therefore asserted its jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings (after it had stayed the insolvency proceedings in England in August 2019 due to the court in Düsseldorf, Germany, claiming its jurisdiction). The German Federal Court of Justice rendered its decision (based on the Court of Justice of the European Union decision) on 8 December 2022, declaring that since the English courts did not make their winding-up order prior to the Brexit transition period, i.e. 31 December 2020 such that the German courts are no longer bound by the EU Insolvency regulation when considering proceedings opened in England, the German courts had retrospective authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019. Thus, the German insolvency proceedings remain in place, alongside the competing equivalent English proceedings. - The purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., Luxembourg (former 100 percent shareholder of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) has brought a claim against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. in Luxembourg detailing his allegations that the Restructuring (i.e. the refinancing of Galapagos Group and the sale of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove Group) involved a fraudulent exercise of a Luxembourg share pledge and that it should, therefore, be unwound. However, no steps have been taken by the administrator to progress this claw back action. In addition, the administrator has brought a separate action challenging the 2021 restructuring of the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This action raises similar allegations to those made in the claw back action. The Luxembourg Court has yet to order a timetable for Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l’ to file their defence. The purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., had initiated a claw back action against inter alios Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l.  This proceeding was dismissed by the District Court of Düsseldorf on 15 June 2023. The dismissal is legally binding. This is closed now. Based on legal advice of leading international law firms based in the UK, Luxembourg, Germany and the US (privilege in respect of which is not waived) and based on the final decisions of the courts in England, New York and Germany, Management assesses the risk from the above-mentioned ongoing litigation as well as future litigation as follows: 1) The risk that the Restructuring would be unwound is considered remote; and 2) The risk of having to pay damages to former holders of the Galapagos Senior Notes or any other third party is considered unlikely.

For more details regarding the share-based payments we refer to note “9.5 Share based payments” ##### 9.5 Share based payments In 2020 certain management personnel (“co-investors”) were invited to participate in the Mangrove Group’s Management Incentive Plan (“Mangrove MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of Mangrove Management Invest S.C.A; an entity which has a part-ownership of Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l., the parent company of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l.. In order to participate in the MIP, an initial cash investment was required from the co-investors, which was at not less than the fair value of the investments. During the year 2022 an additional Management Incentive Plan was launched. Again, certain management personnel were invited to participate in the new Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group’s Management Incentive Plan (“KTS MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of TESCO Management S.C.A; an entity which has a minority of TES LuxCo S.à r.l.. TES LuxCo S.à r.l. is the parent company of the Mangrove´s business unit Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group. Similar to the first MIP (“Mangrove MIP”) launched in 2020, the investment is structured in a way that the co-investors are taking a part ownership of a holding company via an investment vehicle. In order to participate in the KTS MIP, in a first step the co-investors sold their contribution in the Mangrove MIP at fair value to Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.. In the amount of this receivable from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l., the co-investors received an investment in the new KTS MIP. The initial cash related investment of the co-investors (receivable from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.) in KTS MIP was not less than to the fair value of the investment in any case. The nature of both schemes is such that co-investors’ investments will only be realised upon “exit” of the Group’s current shareholders, with exception of specific events (for example co-investors leaving the employment of the Group). It is anticipated that co-investors will participate in the MIPs until such exit is achieved. The lead investor is permitted to issue further equity, and each co-investor has the explicit right to participate further in the MIPs, such that their investment is not diluted. In the context of IFRS 2, both MIPs are considered to be equity-settled share-based payment arrangements. ##### 9.6 Company bodies The board members of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. are: Matthew Crill Joakim Lindström-Formicola ##### 9.7 Shareholder committees The members of Kelvion's shareholder committee are: - Hubertus Mühlhäuser - Michael Gahleitner ----- - Claus von Hermann In total, the Group incurred shareholder committee costs amounting to EUR 260 thousand. ##### 9.8 Disclosure of Audit Fees KPMG Audit, S.à r.l., Luxembourg, and other member firms of the KPMG network, provided the following services during the past two financial years to Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l.: (EUR thousand) **2023** **2022 Audit 1.322 1,663 Tax Consulting Services 1.633 1,503 Audit-related services  - 349 Other services 47.5 87",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

In addition, the administrator brought a separate action in Luxembourg challenging the 2021 restructuring of the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.

Kennedy L-1855 Luxembourg ###### To the Sole Shareholder of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. 2, rue Edward Steichen L-2540 Luxembourg Luxembourg Tel.: +352 22 51 51 1 Fax: +352 22 51 71 E-mail: info@kpmg.lu Internet: www.kpmg.lu ###### REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries (the ""Group""), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (the “Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other information The Board of Managers is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” thereon. ----- ###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Managers for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Managers determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Managers is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Responsibilities of the réviseur d’entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Managers. ----- ###### — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managers' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

General information #### 1.1 Company information Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l., Luxembourg, hereinafter also referred to as "" Mangrove LuxCo III "" or the ""company"" is a public limited liability company (Société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office at 2, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register (Registre de Commerce et des Sociétés Luxembourg) with registration number B236258. Sole shareholder of the company is Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l., Luxembourg, which itself is a direct subsidiary of Galapagos LuxCo I S.à r.l., Luxembourg. The Company was incorporated on July 11, 2019. The purpose of the Company is the acquisition, holding and disposal of interests in Luxembourg and/or foreign companies and undertakings as well as the administration, development and management of such interests. #### 1.2 Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries and successful Refinancing on October 9, 2019 With an effective date October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., Luxembourg, a 100 percent subsidiary of Mangrove LuxCo III, bought 100 percent of the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg and all its subsidiaries (together “Galapagos BidCo Group”). Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg, was 100 percent shareholder of the shares in Kelvion Finance GmbH, Germany including all of its subsidiaries (together “Kelvion Group”) and in ENEXIO Management GmbH, Germany including all of its subsidiaries (together “ENEXIO Group”) at the acquisition date. Before the acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group, the Company did not have any operational activities. The Acquisition was consummated in connection with the balance sheet restructuring transaction of the Galapagos Group, the former shareholder of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., which has resulted in a major recapitalization of the operating business of the Mangrove LuxCo III, Mangrove LuxCo IV and the newly acquired subsidiaries (collectively, the “Mangrove Group”), a deleveraging of the Mangrove Group’s balance sheet and access to new debt facilities and instruments with longer tenors (the “Restructuring”). In connection with the Restructuring, the Company issued EUR 356,233,492 in aggregate principal amount of 7.775 percent senior secured fixed rate notes due 2025 (the “New Notes”). In preparation of the aforesaid acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group the Company incorporated or acquired the following direct and indirect subsidiaries: Incorporation of Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., Luxembourg on July 11, 2019 and indirectly via the participation in Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. the following holding entities in Germany were acquired on October 9, 2019: Mangrove GermanCo I GmbH, Germany and Mangrove GermanCo II GmbH, Germany. In the following, Mangrove LuxCo III and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries is referred to as ""Mangrove Group"" or “the Group”. ----- #### 1.3 Description of the business The Mangrove Group is a leading global manufacturer of heat exchangers and other cooling & heating products. The Group is active in multiple end markets such as Refrigeration, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning), Data Center, Power, Heavy & Light Industry, Chemicals, Oil & Gas, Food & Beverage and Marine. In those markets, the “new Group” services a broad, diversified and long-standing customer base in more than 130 countries. ###### 1.3.1 Segment Reporting Mangrove Group operates through the four Kelvion segments, “Kelvion Refrigeration Technologies” (“RT”), “Kelvion Machine Cooling Systems” (“MCS”), “Kelvion Plate Heat Exchangers” (“PHE”) and “Kelvion Thermal Solutions” (“KTS”). The former segment “ENEXIO” continues to be in the process of being wound down. ENEXIO, manufacturer of power plant and industry cooling systems as well as wastewater treatment solutions, consisted of three business units: Dry Cooling Systems (DCS), Service Solutions and Water Technologies (WT). After the strategic decision was taken to exit the DCS business and to either sell or integrate the Service and Water business into Kelvion Group, one part of the DCS business (DCS Heller) was successfully sold at the end of 2020 and on October 20, 2021 closing in connection with the share purchase and transfer agreement for the shares of ENEXIO companies comprising the Service business took place. Furthermore, on January 3, 2022 the same was executed in connection with the shares of ENEXIO companies comprising the Water business. On March 23, 2022 the Group signed an asset-/share purchase agreement for certain parts of the DCS business (DCS Air Cooled Condenser) comprising the stake in an Indian Joint Venture as well as certain assets (intellectual property in Germany and one production line in China). After these transactions, only parts of the Dry Cooling business remain with the Group, until the continuing wind-down of this activity has been completed. The declining importance of the ENEXIO Business is also reflected in its decreasing volume, which represented in FY 2021 already less than 10 Percent and in FY 2022 less than 1 Percent in terms of Mangrove Group. Overall, the contribution of the segment ENEXIO to revenue and normalized EBITDA of the Group is no longer significant for the Group’s earnings position. ###### 1.3.2 The four segments of Mangrove Group The four segments of Mangrove Group focus on distinct technologies and product portfolios: - **Kelvion Refrigeration Technologies (RT) focuses on component business for refrigeration applications with significant growth potential in the data center industry. RT supplies a wide range of standard and customized heat exchangers for cooling and removing heat from different types of data centers (hyperscale, colocation, modular etc.) using both air and liquid cooling methods. The data center market consists of cooling solutions such as air conditioning, chilling units, economizer systems, liquid cooling systems, control systems and includes services such as consulting, installation & deployment and maintenance and support. The heat exchanger solutions are also used in the refrigeration market in cold chain warehouses, supermarkets, non-residential buildings, and industrial production. Product offering includes air cooled condensers which reject heat from refrigeration systems and are often sold as part of a package of equipment with air coolers. RT’s customized air coolers are design-to-order units for industrial or OEM solutions for food processing and distribution facilities. Product offering includes also customized radiators and dry coolers which are mainly used for power and industrial applications. Improving the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment is essential for end users looking to reduce carbon footprint and operating costs. ----- - **Kelvion Machine Cooling Systems (MCS) is a leading player in heat exchangers for power and engine applications with substantial growth opportunities by leveraging its global installed base. MCS supplies heat exchangers for power generation, power transmission, large engine applications (marine and off highway) and green applications like biomass, green hydrogen, or renewable energies. The business is mostly with OEM, e.g., for large engine manufacturers, but MCS also engages in smaller projects, like solar, wind or solar photovoltaic. Product offering includes charge air coolers, which cool down combustion-air coming from the turbocharger before entering the engine. MCS’ shell and tube double safety heat exchangers assure the secure handling of safety-critical media. Product offering also includes box coolers which are fitted in the sea chest of small and medium-sized vessels. - **Kelvion Thermal Solutions (KTS), is Kelvion’s largest segment, focusing on project business for demanding applications in the Oil & Gas, Chemicals Industries and, like RT, with significant growth potential in high tech data center business as well as green tech applications such as hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). KTS’ engineering expertise plays a key role in differentiation against competitors. High degree of geographical diversification with sites in all key region, including Europe, NAFTA, Latin America, China and MEA. Product offering includes air fin coolers typically used for very large cooling requirements in different industries, e.g., Oil & Gas and Chemicals, as well as air dryers which are used to remove humidity from an air stream in various process industries. KTS’ shell & tube heat exchangers are used to heat, cool, or condense water and other media in different process industries. The focus of the BU has shifted in the recent years from Oil & Gas and Petrochemicals to high and green tech business. KTS represents mainly the former segment “Kelvion Thermal Engineered Solutions” (“TES”). - **Kelvion Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) provides a broad range of plate heat exchangers for a wide variety of applications in terms of pressure and temperature demands for a wide range of customer industries, ranging from HVAC and Refrigeration to Food & Beverages, Chemicals, Power, and Industrials. Product offering includes fully welded plate heat exchangers which are used to save energy in demanding high pressure and temperature applications, as well as brazed plate heat exchangers, often used for environmentally friendly heat pump applications. PHE’s gasketed heat exchangers have the highest efficiency and flexibility and are used in a variety of industries as well as for heat recovery applications. In contrast to the project driven segment KTS, the three segments RT, MCS and PHE represent the component type business of the Group and form together “Kelvion Products” (“KP”). All four segments hold strong favorable market positions in their respective markets. MCS and PHE are among the TOP 3, RT amongst the Top 5 and KTS is niche-market leader. In addition to the above segments there is the fifth Service segment, which is a virtual segment, i.e., Service is not separated from the four segments but managed globally and centrally across segments. ----- ## 2. Reporting and Accounting principles #### 2.1 Going-concern basis of accounting ###### Preparation of consolidated financial statements With effective date December 21, 2022, the Group agreed with the lenders to reset the financial covenants, to which the budget 2023 offers sufficient headroom. In the first three months of the year 2023 the Group can report an order intake and a financial performance that exceeds previous year and budget 2023. Based on the good start to the year, management of the Group expects the financial performance for the full year to exceed budget. With current market conditions and business performance, the Group does not see any current risk to complying with future covenant requirements and consequently the management does not see any risk to the going concern of the Group. Based on actual planning the Group will be at every time and in the upcoming year in the position to meet all its financial obligations. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group have been prepared on a going concern basis. #### 2.2 Basis of presentation The presented consolidated financial statements cover the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 with the prior period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. The consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group - which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes to the consolidated financial statements - include Mangrove LuxCo III and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as “Mangrove Group” or the “Group”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. All IFRS standards and interpretations in effect for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, have been applied. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro (EUR), the functional currency of the group, and presented in thousand of euros (EUR thousand) or in millions of euros (EUR million). Due to rounding, figures presented may result in differences of EUR 1 thousand in certain cases. To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement have been aggregated and are explained accordingly in the Notes. Assets and liabilities are classified into current and non-current items. Current assets are expected to be realized within 12 months after the reporting period and current liabilities are due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period. The consolidated income statement is prepared using the cost of sales method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method for cash flows from operating activities and the direct method for cash flows from investing and financing activities. The accounting and measurement principles are presented and explained in detail in Note 2.8. The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Managers on April 28, 2023. #### 2.3 First-time adoption of new accounting pronouncements The Group applied for the first time all standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods ----- beginning on January 1, 2022. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group is not significant. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendments that were issued but are not yet effective. ###### 2.3.1 Accounting regulations applied for the first time in the year 2022 - **Amendments to IFRS 16 (Effective April 1, 2021) IFRS 16 contains regulations regarding the recognition of changes in lease payments (including rental concessions) by the lessee. In general, the lessee must assess for each lease whether the lease concessions granted constitute changes to the lease and must remeasure the lease liability as a result. In response to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, IFRS 16 Leases was amended on March 31, 2021 to provide a one-year extension of the practical expedient to assist lessees in accounting for COVID-19-related lease concessions. The amendments extend the practical expedient to lease concessions that reduce lease payments originally due on or before June 30, 2022. Previously, only lease concessions that reduce lease payments that are or were due on or before June 30, 2021, were within the scope of the relief. - **Amendments to IAS 37 (Effective January 1, 2022) Clarification that the cost of fulfilling a contract includes all directly attributable costs. The cost of fulfilling the contract includes both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (such as direct wage and material costs) and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. In addition, it is clarified that before a provision for an onerous contract is established, an entity should recognize any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in (previously: dedicated to) fulfilling the contract. - **Amendments to IFRS 3 (Effective January 1, 2022) In accordance to the amended framework, references to the framework in various standards, including IFRS 3, have been adjusted. The rules for accounting for business combinations are not changed in substance. The amendments are to be applied to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. - **Improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 (Effective January 1, 2022) The Annual Improvements to IFRS amended the following standards: `o` In IFRS 1, the option was opened for first-time adopters of IFRS 1.D16 (a) to measure cumulative translation differences at the amounts recognized by the parent. `o` The amendment to IFRS 9 clarifies which fees are to be included in the 10 percent test (IFRS 9.B3.3.6) with regard to the assessment of whether a financial liability is derecognized. Only fees paid or received between the entity as borrower and the lender are included. `o` In IFRS 16, the presentation of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements has been removed in explanatory example 13 to IFRS 16. `o` In IAS 41, the prohibition on including tax payments in the fair value measurement is removed. - **Amendments to IAS 16 (Effective January 1, 2022) The amendment prohibits entities from deducting the cost of an item of property, plant and ----- equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Clarification of the definition of the costs of testing. Revenue and cost that relate to items produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities must be presented separately. Disclosure of the line item in the statement of comprehensive item that includes such revenue. ###### 2.3.2 Accounting regulations not applied in advance of their effective date The following standards and amendments to existing standards of possible relevance to the Group, which were adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) but are not yet mandatory, have not been applied early: - **IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (including Amendments) (Effective January 1, 2023) IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 and for the first time sets out standard requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Under the IFRS 17 measurement model, groups of insurance contracts are measured based on the expected value of discounted cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risks as well as a contractual service margin that results in the recognition of profit in line with the provision of services. The amendments add a transition option aimed to improve the usefulness of comparative information presented on initial application of both IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 and introduce the option of applying a ""classification overlay approach"". This option can be applied when IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 are applied simultaneously for the first time and no ""restatement"" of a financial asset with regard to the comparative information of IFRS 9 in 2022 is made. - **Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 (Effective January 1, 2023) The amendment to IAS 1 requires that only ""significant"" accounting policies are presented in the notes. To be material, the accounting policy must be related to significant transactions or other events and there must be a reason for its presentation. A reason may be, for example, that the method has been changed, it is an option, the method is complex or highly judgmental, or it has been developed in accordance with IAS 8.10-11. The amendments to Practice Statement 2 accordingly indicate how the concept of materiality is applied to the disclosure of accounting policies. Thus, in the future, company-specific disclosures are to be given priority over standardized disclosures. - **Amendments to IAS 8 (Effective January 1, 2023) The amendment to IAS 8 clarifies how entities can better distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in estimates. For this purpose, it is defined that an accounting estimate always relates to a measurement uncertainty of a financial figure in the financial statements. In addition to input parameters, an entity also uses valuation techniques to determine an estimate. Valuation techniques can be estimation techniques or valuation techniques. ----- - **Amendments to IAS 12 (Effective January 1, 2023) The amendments address previously existing uncertainties in the accounting for deferred taxes in connection with leases and disposal or restoration obligations. The amendments clarify the application of the already existing “initial recognition exemption” (IAS 12.15) and result in the recognition of deferred taxes, e.g. on leases accounted for by the lessee and on disposal or restoration obligations. This is therefore an exemption to the ""initial recognition exemption"" for narrowly defined cases. These new standards and amendments to existing standards will be applied by the Group starting in fiscal 2022 or later. No material impacts are expected. #### 2.4 Accounting pronouncements not yet endorsed by the EU In previous years, and in fiscal year 2022, the IASB issued the following standards and amendments to existing standards of relevance to the Group, which still have to be adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) before they become applicable: - **Amendments to IAS 1 (Effective January 1, 2023) The amendments to IAS 1 concern a limited adjustment to the assessment criteria for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. It is clarified that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the entity's rights at the reporting date to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the reporting period: If such rights exist, the liability is classified as non-current. The right to defer settlement of the liability must be substantial. If the entity has to meet certain conditions in order to exercise such a right, these conditions must be met at the reporting date; otherwise, the liability is classified as current. For the classification of a liability, it is irrelevant whether management intends or expects that the liability will actually be settled within twelve months after the balance sheet date. The only decisive factor for classification is the right existing at the balance sheet date to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months. This also applies in the event of settlement within the value recovery period. - **Amendments to IFRS 16 (Effective January 1, 2024) The Amendments to IFRS 16 shall clarify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale. It requires a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in a way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The new requirements do not prevent a seller-lessee from recognising in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of a lease. - **Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 The amendments address a known inconsistency between the requirements of IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (2011) in the case of the disposal of assets to an associate or joint venture or the contribution of assets to an associate or joint venture. ----- IFRS 10 requires a parent to recognize the full amount of the gain or loss on disposal of a subsidiary in profit or loss when control is lost. In contrast, the currently applicable IAS 28.28 requires that the gain or loss on disposal of a disposal transaction between an investor and an investment accounted for using the equity method - whether an associate or a joint venture - be recognized only to the extent of the other's interest in the entity. In the future, the entire gain or loss on a transaction is to be recognized only if the assets sold or contributed constitute a business as defined by IFRS 3. This applies regardless of whether the transaction is structured as a share or asset deal. If, on the other hand, the assets do not constitute a business, only pro rata income recognition is permitted. The IASB has postponed the date of first-time application of the amendments indefinitely. #### 2.5 Impact of the introduction of a global minimum tax rate by the OECD (Pillar Two) To address concerns about the unequal distribution of profits and unequal tax levies of large multinational corporations, various agreements have been reached at the global level, including an agreement by over 135 countries to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent. In December 2021, the OECD published a draft legal framework, followed by detailed guidance in March 2022, to be used by individual countries that are signatories to the agreement to amend their local tax laws. Once the changes in tax laws are in place or will soon be in place in the countries where the Group operates, the Group may be subject to the minimum tax. At the date of authorization of the consolidated financial statements for issue, the tax legislation related to the minimum tax is not applicable or soon to be applicable in any of the countries in which the Group operates. The Board closely monitors the progress of the legislative process in each country in which the Group operates. As of December 31, 2022, the Group did not have sufficient information to determine the potential quantitative impact. #### 2.6 Basis of consolidation ###### Consolidated entities The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Mangrove LuxCo III and its direct and indirect subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are generally prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, except of the Indian subsidiary, consistently applying group IFRS accounting policies. The financial year ends due to local Indian commercial law on March 31, each year. This company was incorporated in the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group on the basis of interim financial statements. All intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. The consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group include Mangrove LuxCo III and all material companies which Mangrove LuxCo III controls directly or indirectly. Companies are consolidated as of the date on which control is obtained by Mangrove LuxCo III. They are deconsolidated as of the date on which control is lost. In addition to the ultimate parent company, 55 companies were consolidated. ----- The scope of consolidation changed as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The consideration paid is measured on the basis of the fair value of the assets received, the liabilities assumed from the seller, and the equity instruments issued at the transaction date. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are recognised at their fair value at the transaction date, irrespective of any non-controlling interests. Any contingent consideration agreed is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. The excess of cost over the share of the fair value of the company’s net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. If, after a further examination, cost is lower than the share of the fair value of the subsidiary’s acquired net assets measured at fair value, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss. ----- Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed within the period they occur. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Where a subsidiary is disposed of, such that control is no longer held, the entity is removed from the consolidation as at the date when control ceases. If individual group companies have a different reporting date, they are included on the basis of interim financial statements as of the respective reporting date.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

Consolidated statement of financial position disclosures: Assets #### 5.1 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the end of the fiscal year and whenever there is any indication of a potential impairment. The units to which the goodwill is allocated represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other (groups of) assets and the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. In the Mangrove Group, the 4 CGU-segments are coming from four business units Refrigeration Technologies, Machine Cooling Systems, Kelvion Thermal Solutions and Plate Heat Exchangers. The goodwill arose from the acquisition of the Galapagos BidCo Group on October 9, 2019. Goodwill primarily derives from future growth that is expected with new customers and new technological developments. No goodwill was allocated to the former cash-generating unit ENEXIO, as the economic situation does not justify a goodwill.

This detailed planning has been expanded by two years, of which the year 2026 is a transitional period and the year 2027 is used as terminal value. The business plan for the Mangrove Group is based on CGU-specific assumptions about the trend in key macroeconomic parameters such as gross domestic product, market share, trends in labor costs, as well as trends in the cost of raw materials and regulatory framework conditions. Based on this, plan key figures are developed for each CGU for the three-year planning period, which are used to derive at net cash flows to complete the planning process prepared by segment's key management and discussed in shareholder committees.

The goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2022 leads to no impairment, as the recoverable amounts of the segments are higher than the carrying amount of the respective segment assets. The net cash inflows are discounted at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt capital. To account for the different risk and return profiles of the Mangrove Group’s principal businesses, the after-tax cost of capital is calculated separately for each unit and a specific capital structure is defined by benchmarking against comparable companies in the same industry sector. The cost of equity corresponds to the return expected by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the conditions on which comparable companies can obtain long-term financing. Both components are derived from capital market information. The value in use is based on the following key assumptions: For the period beyond the detailed planning horizon, cash flows are based on an extrapolation using a growth rate of 1.50 percent (FY 2021: 1.00 percent). The increase of 0.5 percent is mainly due to the fact that the assumption on the growth rate is inflation driven growth. This underlying growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth for the markets in which the segments operate. The CGU-specific total cost of capital assumed for discounting is based on a risk-free long-term interest rate of 2 percent and a market risk premium of 7.5 percent. Additionally, beta factors, a borrowing risk premium as well as capital structures were derived from a peer group for each cash-generating unit. Also, unit-specific tax rates were applied.

The defined benefit pension plan obligations mainly exist in Germany. Mangrove Group grants old-age, disability, and survivors’ benefits to many of its employees. New employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions. As part of the general benefits provided all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their compensation. Under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of up to 100 percent of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit. A corresponding collective bargaining agreement was entered by the predecessors of the Group in 2002 and revised in 2008. The new pension plan beginning in January 2019 does not only provide for pension payments, but also capital payments and installment payments. The post-retirement benefits are adjusted by minimum of 1 percent each year, according to the occupational retirement act (§ 16 Betriebsrentengesetz). In 2022 post-retirement benefits are adjusted by 2.2 percent. In addition to the currently open benefit schemes, there are a number of historical pension schemes in the company. These schemes are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for ----- employees who were members at the time the scheme was closed. The pension liabilities are partly covered by reinsurance policies. All liabilities were actuarially valued as of December 31, 2022. Mangrove Group views granting pension benefits as an opportunity to foster employee loyalty and engagement. It is therefore an integral part of the remuneration concept and has an appropriate employee contribution component. In connection with this, Mangrove Group observes developments on the human resources market and regularly checks that the benefits it grants are appropriate and in line with the market. Mangrove Group does not believe that the pension liabilities pose any risks over and above the customary extent and the general risks described above.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

As a result, their fair values correspond to the carrying amounts. Regarding Tracking preferred equity certificates / shareholder loan we refer to Note 6.2. The carrying amount of the trade payables and other current liabilities that are subject to the measurement rules of IFRS 9 corresponds to their fair value. The fair value of fixed-interest liabilities is the present value of their expected future cash flows. They are discounted at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. The carrying amount of variable-rate liabilities corresponds to their fair value. The fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives are calculated using quoted exchange rates and yield curves observable in the market. Accordingly, they are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of senior secured notes is categorized within Level 1. Fair Value is calculated according to its quoted (unadjusted) price in active market. The fair value of other financial assets of shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments is measured on the basis of available financial information, such as transaction prices for financing rounds or business plans to the extent that this information is reliable, or, as an approximation, as cost, which is considered an appropriate estimate of fair value as no more suitable information is available. A review is carried out on a quarterly basis using all information available on the equity investments to establish whether cost is still representative of fair value. This would not be the case, for example, in the event of a significant change in the market in which the equity investments are active. As cost is the sole input factor for fair value, a percentage change in cost results in an equal change in fair value. The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) with any increase (decrease) in cost. A 1% increase (decrease) would not materially affect fair value. Accordingly, they are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

The foreign tax rate differences are due to different tax rates outside Luxembourg, which vary from between 0.00 percent (UAE) and 34.00 percent (Brazil) (2021: 0.00 percent (UAE) and 34.00 percent (Brazil)). The tax income driven by tax rate changes mainly relate to the increase of the tax rate for state tax of an American legal entity which led to a higher DTA amount of EUR 3.899 thousand and the decrease of the tax rate for Corporate Income Tax for a Chinese legal entity which led to reduction of DTA of EUR 1.068 thousand. Taxes relating to other periods amounting to EUR 5,964 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,973 thousand) comprise current taxes and deferred taxes for previous years. It mainly relates to America (EUR 1,486 thousand) and France (EUR 3,126 thousand). The change in the valuation allowance of EUR 7,893 thousand (prior year: EUR -5,037 thousand) is mainly based on a reassessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards.

Contingent liabilities, other financial obligations, and litigation #### 9.1 Contingent liabilities A Contingent liability is according to IAS 37.10 a “possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because: ###### (i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or ###### (ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.”, i.e. uncertainties for which the outcome has not been determined. If the occurrence is probable and the outcome can be estimated reliable, a liability is recorded in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, Mangrove Group has a recognized contingent liability relating to the SSNs which amounts to EUR 26,412 thousand (2021: EUR 34,165 thousand) as of December 31, 2022. This contingent liability was recognized via purchase price allocation.. Several companies of Mangrove Group have issued or instructed the issuance of bank guarantees in favor of customers or lenders.

However, as with any dispute, the outcome of these proceedings cannot be guaranteed. In the opinion of Management, the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims will not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the Group, but it might be possible that the conclusion of such proceedings may result in future income or expenses if the amounts that have been accrued for them are higher or lower than required. On October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. acquired the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. as described elsewhere in these notes (e.g. chapter “1.2 Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries and successful Refinancing on October 9, 2019”), associated preferred equity certificates and any intercompany payables owed by Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to its former parent company Galapagos S.A. The acquisition was made in connection with the Restructuring, which was completed on October 9, 2019. A number of sets of internationally recognized advisors were involved in the Restructuring and management believes that the Restructuring was fully legally effective and complied with all obligations, including under the applicable finance documents. The following claims have been brought which arise out of the Restructuring: - Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. has commenced proceedings in England against inter alios the Security Trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement which effected the Restructuring, the trustee which held rights on behalf of the Galapagos Senior Notes and each of the plaintiffs in the New York, German and Luxembourg proceedings described below, requesting that the English Court makes a series of declarations inter alia that the Restructuring complied with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The English proceedings do not contain any claim for damages. A challenge to the jurisdiction of the English Court to hear this claim was lodged by two of the defendants in these proceedings and was heard in December 2020. This challenge was dismissed by the English Court on 19 January 2021. The trial commenced on 9 March and concluded on 23 March. A judgment is expected before summer 2023. - A claim in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a beneficial holder of the Galapagos Senior Notes (“NY Claimant”) against inter alios Galapagos Holding (former indirect parent of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) and certain of its subsidiaries (now being subsidiaries of Mangrove Group) relating to the Restructuring. The plaintiff alleges that the Restructuring wrongly deprived it of value by diverting assets away from the Group and releasing certain guarantees. The plaintiff seeks: (i) damages; and (ii) a reversal of the steps taken to affect the Restructuring. In addition, the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the release of liabilities under the Galapagos Senior Notes Indenture pursuant to the provisions of the former Intercreditor Agreement applying to certain liabilities of the Group was invalid (in other words, that this part of the Restructuring also be reversed). The Supreme Court of the State of New York decided on 22 July 2020 to stay this action pending a decision from the English Court as to its jurisdiction in these matters (as referred to ----- above). The plaintiff indicated that it intended to appeal this decision, but no substantive appeal was actually served. Following the decision by the English Court on 19 January 2021, the proceedings in New York are still stayed. - On October 31, 2019 main insolvency proceedings were opened over the assets of Galapagos S.A. in Düsseldorf, Germany. Two appeals were lodged at the German Federal Supreme Court on the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf insolvency court. Following such appeals, on December 17, 2020, the German Federal Court of Justice referred certain legal questions concerning matters of European insolvency law (and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf court in such insolvency proceedings) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for determination. The Court of Justice of the European Union rendered its decision on 24 March 2022, which confirmed that the German courts did not have authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019, given that the European regime applied to the UK at this time. Following this decision, on 30 June 2022 the English insolvency court made a winding-up order with regard to Galapagos S.A., and has therefore asserted its jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings (after it had stayed the insolvency proceedings in England in August 2019 due to the court in Düsseldorf, Germany, claiming its jurisdiction). The German Federal Court of Justice rendered its decision (based on the Court of Justice of the European Union decision) on 8 December 2022, declaring that since the English courts did not make their winding-up order prior to the Brexit transition period, i.e. 31 December 2020 such that the German courts are no longer bound by the EU Insolvency regulation when considering proceedings opened in England, the German courts had retrospective authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019,. Thus, the German insolvency proceedings remain in place, alongside the competing equivalent English proceedings. - The purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., Luxembourg (former 100 percent shareholder of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) has brought a claim against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. in Luxembourg detailing his allegations that the Restructuring (i.e. the refinancing of Galapagos Group and the sale of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove Group) involved a fraudulent exercise of a Luxembourg share pledge and that it should, therefore, be unwound. However, no steps have been taken by the administrator to progress this claw back action. In addition to the main claim, following the administrator’s application the Luxembourg Court granted an ex parte “preservation order” whereby a trustee was appointed to prevent an actual or de facto liquidation of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This escrow order has been successfully appealed and set aside by the Luxembourg Court. This decision was then appealed by the administrator, but this appeal was rejected by the Court. A further appeal was then made by the administrator to the Luxembourg Cour de cassation which overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision to set aside the escrow order on the basis that share pledge enforcements cannot be challenged under Luxembourg law. The matter was referred back to the Luxembourg Court to consider the position on the merits. The Luxembourg Court of Appeal decided that the administrator had not demonstrated that any fraudulent action took place and it therefore dismissed the appeal. The consequence of these various actions is that there is no escrow order in place. Finally, the administrator has brought a separate action challenging the 2021 restructuring of the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This action raises similar allegations to those made in the claw back action. The Luxembourg Court has yet to order a timetable for Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l’ to file their defence. - Following an application of the purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., the District Court of Düsseldorf, Germany, had issued an injunction (einstweilige Verfügung) against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., ordering an escrow agent to hold the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This order was successfully appealed and, consequently, the injunction was lifted in June 2021. Further, by the same plaintiff, a main proceeding (Hauptsacheverfahren) has been initiated against inter alios Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. A first hearing took place in February 2023 with a decision announced for May 2023. Based on legal advice of leading international law firms based in the UK, Luxembourg, Germany and the US ----- (privilege in respect of which is not waived) Management assesses the risk from the above-mentioned ongoing litigation as well as future litigation as follows: 1) The risk that the Restructuring would be unwound is considered remote; and 2) The risk of having to pay damages to former holders of the Galapagos Senior Notes or any other third party is considered unlikely. In the unlikely event of successful damage claims against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the RCF Facility Agreement, the SGF Facility Agreement, the Cash Cover Loan Facility Agreement and the Mangrove Notes Indenture will permit the Group to incur up to EUR 100 million of new indebtedness only for these purposes which will rank senior to the Mangrove Senior Notes. Therefore, Management is confident to be able to fund such claims from new indebtedness and/or cash available. ## 10.Other disclosures #### 10.1 Consolidated cash flow statement disclosures from continuing operations",N/A,as_expected,2024,502

For more details regarding the share-based payments we refer to Note 10.5 #### 10.5 Share based payments In 2020 certain management personnel (“co-investors”) were invited to participate in the Mangrove Group’s Management Incentive Plan (“Mangrove MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of Mangrove Management Invest S.C.A; an entity which has a part-ownership of Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l., the parent company of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l.. In order to participate in the MIP, an initial cash investment was required from the co-investors, which was at not less than the fair value of the investments. During the year 2022 an additional Management Incentive Plan was launched. Again, certain management personnel were invited to participate in the new Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group’s Management Incentive Plan (“KTS MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of TESCO Management S.C.A; an entity which has a minority of TES LuxCo S.à r.l.. TES LuxCo S.à r.l. is the parent company of the Mangrove´s business unit Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group. Similar to the first MIP (“Mangrove MIP”) launched in 2020, the investment is structured in a way that the co-investors are taking a part ownership of a holding company via an investment vehicle. In order to participate in the KTS MIP, in a first step the co-investors sold their contribution in the Mangrove MIP at fair value to Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.. In the amount of this receivable from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l., the co-investors received an investment in the new KTS MIP. The initial cash related investment of the co-investors (receivable from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.) in KTS MIP was not less than to the fair value of the investment in any case. The nature of both schemes is such that co-investors’ investments will only be realised upon “exit” of the Group’s current shareholders, with exception of specific events (for example co-investors leaving the employment of the Group). It is anticipated that co-investors will participate in the MIPs until such exit is achieved. The lead investor is permitted to issue further equity, and each co-investor has the explicit right to participate further in the MIPs, such that their investment is not diluted. In the context of IFRS 2, both MIPs are considered to be equity-settled share-based payment arrangements. #### 10.6 Company bodies The board members of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. are: Matthew Crill Joakim Lindström-Formicola ----- #### 10.7 Shareholder committees The members of Kelvion's shareholder committee are: - Hubertus Mühlhäuser - Michael Gahleitner - Claus von Hermann In total, the Group incurred shareholder committee costs amounting to EUR 182 thousand. #### 10.8 Disclosure of Audit Fees KPMG Audit, S.à r.l., Luxembourg, and other member firms of the KPMG network, provided the following services during the past two financial years to Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l.: (EUR thousand) **2022** **2021 Audit 1,663 2,135 Tax Consulting Services 1,503 1,809 Audit-related services 349 Other services 87 93",N/A,as_expected,2024,502
