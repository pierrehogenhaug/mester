This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the
EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of the EEA of Notes which are the subject
of this Offering may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers
to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor
the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes in circumstances in which

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution
of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling,
or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of
such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

_Operations,” “Industry,” and “Business” describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial_
condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New

The Issuer urges you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,”

_Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash_
_flows from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes.”_

This Offering Memorandum includes certain of our historical financial information. In particular, this Offering

subsidiaries as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, prepared in accordance with IFRS on
interim financial reporting (IAS 34) and including comparative financial information for the three months

is taken from the comparative prior year figures included in the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. In
particular, certain financial information in the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2022 and
December 31, 2022 were corrected and restated in the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements by correcting and
restating the relevant financial information as of January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022. The correction was due to the
Issuer underestimating a deferred tax liability related to the Existing Notes. For additional information, see Note 9.10 of
the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, financial information presented in this Offering
Memorandum as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 is taken from the comparative prior year figures included

data corrected (as explained above), from the restated data as of January 1, 2022 included in the 2023 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has been calculated by taking the
consolidated statement of profit or loss information of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2023, adding the
consolidated statement of profit or loss information of the Issuer for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and subtracting
the consolidated statement of profit or loss information of the Issuer for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The
financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS

Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial information marked as “unaudited” in tables in this Offering Memorandum
is not taken from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and was either taken from the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements or our internal accounting or reporting systems or is based on calculations of
figures of the above-mentioned sources.

We have a large and diverse customer base, including many blue-chip customers, and have built long-standing
customer partnerships. Our customer base comprises more than 19,000 active customers (i.e., customers that have placed
an order with us in the last 24 months) and repeat orders over multiple years from more than 12,000 customers. Our
customer base is also diversified across vertical markets and geographies. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024,
our Order Intake by strategic pillar can be broken down as follows: circa 39% in High Tech, circa 36% in Conventional
applications, circa 17% in services and circa 7% in Green Tech. During the same period, the Order Intake by geography
comprised circa 45% in EMEA, circa 42% in Americas and circa 13% in APAC.

Headquartered in Herne, Germany, we operate in 24 countries around the world, with 22 production facilities, 33
service centers and 19 engineering centers as of March 31, 2024. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we
generated total revenue of €1,401 million and Normalized EBITDA of €157.2 million.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following competitive strengths:

**_Global market leader for mission-critical solutions to transformative industries, including Data Centers, Power &_**
**_Energy, HVAC, Carbon Capture Storage and Hydrogen_**

We are a leading global provider of heat exchanger solutions (source: Frost & Sullivan Report) serving a diverse
range of transformative industries (such as Data Centers, Power & Energy, HVAC, Carbon Capture Storage, and
Hydrogen), and vertical markets with a broad and differentiated product portfolio. We are also among the top three global
providers (based on our Order Intake in the addressable market, as of 2022) and the only company that can provide the full
spectrum of solutions across all vertical markets globally. Our leading market position is supported by our comprehensive
geographical footprint with operations in 24 countries (comprising 22 production facilities, 33 service centers and 19
engineering centers as of March 31, 2024) as well as our diverse product offering across a broad range of heat exchanger
products, which differentiates us from our competitors. Our solutions and products are often mission-critical to our clients’
operations because they are necessary to ensure the efficiency and safety of our clients’ operations while they only represent
a relatively small portion of the overall cost. Transformative Industries support the exponential growth of digital data by
providing the infrastructure for data storage, processing, and management of digital data. Innovations in cooling and energy
efficiency are transforming this sector. Power & Energy includes renewable sources, smart grids and energy storage
solutions. Advances in these areas are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a more sustainable energy
framework. Innovations in HVAC systems are enhancing energy efficiency, comfort in residential, commercial and
industrial buildings. Smart HVAC technologies and sustainable practices are at the forefront of this transformation. The
Carbon Capture Storage industry focuses on technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from industrial
processes and power generation, helping to mitigate climate change. Lastly, the Hydrogen industry is developing
technologies for producing, storing, and utilizing hydrogen as a clean energy source. Hydrogen has the potential to play a
significant role in decarbonizing transportation, industry and power generation.

As part of our High Five program, we focus on vertical markets within the strategic pillars High Tech and Green
Tech. These strategic pillars present a significant market opportunity to us which is forecast to grow significantly until
2027. We estimate that the total addressable market for heat exchangers in the vertical markets comprising our High Tech
and Green Tech pillars amounted to €2.4 billion and €1.1 billion in 2022, respectively (source: Frost & Sullivan Report,
MarketsandMarkets Report, Third Party Report and internal company assessments). These vertical markets are also
forecast to have the most attractive growth rates, expanding at a CAGR of 8% and 20%, respectively, between 2022 and
2027. During the same period, we reduced our exposure to Oil & Gas, Chemicals and Power & Energy from 37% of our
Order Intake for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 29% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

Our decentralized model of local production, near our customers, helps us maintain our leading positions in our
core geographic regions. Our ability to provide a one-stop shop product approach combined with our service offering is
increasingly valued by customers. Compared to smaller, regionally focused peers, we believe we have a better
understanding of technical, health, safety and environmental regulation standards globally and locally. Combined with our
scale and logistical strength to carry out large projects which are generally command improved margins. We believe that
this differentiated product and service offering has been instrumental for recent contract wins from key customers. For
example, we were awarded an order from a leading US-based bitcoin mining platform for adiabatic hybrid coolers. We
developed a customized solution focusing on water and energy consumption. As a result, our cooling solution required
70% less water and 25% less energy than existing models, which also aligns well with our own long-term sustainability
goals. Another example is an order from a US-based hyperscaler in the Data Center vertical market. Through measures,
such as joint technology workshops with the customer, material optimization and a design-to-cost approach, we believe we
were able to reduce the material requirements for our heat exchanger solutions by approximately 10% compared to existing
models. Our global scale also underpins the strength of our brand, which places us well to continue to strengthen our
positions in these fast growing and transformative end-markets segments and vertical markets.

**_Well-positioned to benefit from long-term sustainable secular megatrends, such as increasing environmental awareness_**
**_and the changes triggered by energy transition, along with the growth of digitalization_**

We believe we are strategically well-positioned to benefit from underlying megatrends across our strategic pillars
and vertical markets. The key pillars and vertical markets we serve are characterized by underlying growth supported by
long-term sustainable trends.

For example, the High Tech market, which accounted for 39% of our Order Intake for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024, is projected to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2022 to 2027 due to strong and growing demand for data
centers. The Green Tech market, which accounted for 7% of our Order Intake for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024,
is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% between 2022 to 2027 based on an increasing focus on energy efficiency and
environmental awareness, which, in turn, is driving regulatory changes aimed at climate protection and heat recovery for
residential and commercial buildings as well as for industrial applications (source: Frost & Sullivan Report,
MarketsandMarkets Report, Third Party Report and internal company assessments).

Similar global trends and the (re)-industrialization in Conventional markets underpin the growth outlook across a
range of industries, with the services business also being transformed by a shift to, and higher demand for, high-proximity
and intelligent services.

Note: Based on nominal rates. Primary market for Green Tech is Heat Pumps (HVAC), but definition of Green Tech includes other vertical markets such
as LNG, Green Hydrogen, Carbon Capture and Bio-ethanol. OI = Order Intake

**_Difficult to replicate business model, underpinned by differentiated engineering solutions, service capabilities and_**
**_customer responsiveness_**

We believe our differentiated technical offerings and service capabilities are difficult to replicate and,
consequently, create high barriers to entry and prevent new competitors from easily entering our markets. Our application
engineering expertise and production know-how are based on decades of experience and supported by our network of 19
engineering centers and more than 450 engineers worldwide. Our innovation portfolio includes hybrid coolers for High
Tech, our advanced diffusion bonded heat exchanger “K°Bond” used in oil rigs, LNG, regasification facilities and CO2
stations, natural refrigerants, high pressure laser (HPL) for Green Tech and hydrogen leakage testing for Services. In
particular, our advanced manufacturing technologies, including 3D design and simulation, help to improve product
performance and reduce failure rates. In addition, computational fluid design and simulation is validated by our inhouse
labs and supports the development of our thermal design know-how and proprietary software, which enables us to design
solutions according to customer requirements.

Our differentiated technical solutions are complemented by our strong Service offering and proximity to our
customers, including the ability to provide local service to global customers based on our presence in 24 countries and the
ability to service other third-party brands. This is backed by performance agreements, aimed at maximizing customers’
return on investment and predictive maintenance to reduce operational downtime. We have a full-service portfolio spanning
start-up (safe delivery, installation and early start post installation support), inspection and maintenance (period checks),
repairs and overhauls, testing and monitoring (understanding condition of equipment), spare parts (designed to match the
original parts), upgrades and replacements (for outdated components) and consulting and training (leading to competency

of client personnel). We believe the breadth of our portfolio of Services offers customers seamless operation across the
globe.

The responsiveness to our customers, and our close working relationship build trust in our solutions and delivery.
This builds long-term partnerships and trust fostering reliability as evidenced by the high proportion of our 19,000 active
customers (i.e., customers that have placed an order with us in the last 24 months) that have placed repeat orders over
multiple years. We are of the opinion that these long-term partnerships are another factor that makes our business model
difficult to replicate.

**_Highly diversified revenue stream across geographies and vertical markets ensuring stable growth and operational_**
**_flexibility_**

The combination of our global footprint, comprehensive product portfolio and range of vertical markets we serve
provides us with a well-diversified income stream. We serve approximately ten vertical markets and have operations in 24
countries. This allows us to realize growth opportunities from higher demand in individual sectors or regions, for example
in the Data Center vertical market where revenue contribution increased by 88% in the year ended December 31, 2023
(compared to the year ended December 31, 2022). We also believe this helps us better withstand adverse changes and
developments in a particular market or sector. The charts below show our revenue, by vertical market and by geography,
for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(1) Based on customer country

**_High revenue visibility from strong Order Intake and Order Backlog development_**

Our Order Intake and Order Backlog provide us with high revenue visibility, and we believe the strong
development in our Order Intake and Order Backlog will support our future performance and continued growth. From 2021
to 2023, Order Intake increased at a CAGR of approximately 24%, from €1,099 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, to €1,698 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 and Order Backlog increased from €615 million as of
December 31, 2021 to €1,103 million as of December 31, 2023. Over the same period, our revenue increased from €931.7
million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €1,347.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a
consistent ratio of Order Intake to revenue of more than 1.0x (“book-to-bill ratio”) across the periods. Moreover, for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our book-to-bill-ratio amounted to 1.1x. Revenue visibility is further enhanced by
the fact that, historically, a majority of our Order Intake in any given year was converted into revenue in the same fiscal
year or the next succeeding year. The portion of our Order Intake in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023
that was or is planned to be converted into revenue in the same year or the next succeeding year represented 51% and 54%
of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2023 as well as 62% of our budgeted revenue for the year
ending December 31, 2024. We believe that our high revenue visibility also helps drive our profitability as it allows for
improved management of customer order fulfilment, efficient operations planning and hence limits impacts under
absorption.

Our diversified presence across geographic regions and vertical markets enables us to benefit from increasing
demand in specific regions and vertical markets without being overly dependent on any single region or vertical market.
Order Intake for the year ended December 31, 2023, included €860 million in KTS, €388 million in RT, €258 million in
PHE and €210 million in MCS, driven to a significant extent by strong growth in KTS.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, Order Intake was led by High Tech, followed by Conventional and
with Green Tech and Service broadly equal. Americas and EMEA dominated the regions and APAC has been steadily
growing.

-----

The increase in Order Intake has been driven primarily by high demand for data center applications (particularly
in the United States due to hyperscalers) and HVAC applications (driven by catch-up in China). The growth has also been
attributable to large projects, including a carbon capture project in North America (approximately U.S. $118 million in
contract value) and an Oil & Gas project in Brazil (approximately U.S. $62 million in contract value).

**_Consistent and sustained progress in implementation of operational excellence plan will further enhance profitability_**
**_development_**

We have a strong track record of successfully implementing operational excellence measures across our
businesses to enhance profitability. These include initiatives to drive revenue growth, such as pricing adjustments and
production capacity realignments to increase and optimize production capacity to grow with our customers. To strengthen
our position, we are also refocusing our innovation pipeline to consistently introduce new products on a global scale. They
also include measures focused on our cost position, such as numerous supply chain initiatives across our supply chain on
a global scale (with 74 identified measures completed within 2024), production capacity utilization measures (including
production re-organization) and evaluating product mix to identify and focus on most profitable products and customer
demand. In addition, beginning in 2022, we initiated a range of actions and measures to systematically improve our cash
position by focusing on working capital. These included, among others, regular forecasting and active monitoring of cash
management and cash conversion cycles, enhancements of enterprise resource planning systems to better track inventory
levels and reduce slow-moving materials as well as actively managing receivables through initiating standard customer
debt collection policies. As a result, we reduced trade working capital w/o retention from 12.1% of revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to 1.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Over the same period, we managed
to increase our Free Cash Flow Conversion rate from 57.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 61.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2023.

Over the last three years, we have set several measures to improve our operational efficiency (e.g. quality cost
improvements from inward quality review and improvements in internal processes) and commercial efficiency. Our
commercial efficiency focuses on the core areas (i) target selling (e.g. focus on vertical markets), (ii) process simplification
(e.g. sales order review) and (iii) digitalization. The chart below illustrates the impact of the above mentioned measures on
our Normalized EBITDA between the year ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024:

nEBITDA = Normalized EBITDA

**_Proven leadership team with track record of transformation, growth, and value creation_**

We benefit from an experienced management team led by Andy Blandford, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mark
Bevan, our Chief Financial Officer, each of whom joined the Group in 2022 and have more than 30 years of experience in
various management and executive management positions at leading global companies. Our leadership team includes
Harald Gössl, EVP Technology, and Steffen Thierfelder, EVP Sales & Services, each of whom also has more than 20 years
of experience. They are supported by leadership team with extensive industry experience and operational know-how,
including regional managers responsible for developing their respective markets. We believe that the collective industry
experience and operational know-how of our leadership team, combined with their extensive management experience,
provide us with a competitive advantage and are instrumental for the implementation of our strategy and achievement of
our long-term objective of delivering sustainable growth.

**Our Strategy**

We started our journey to create consistency in performance, profitability and a platform for growth in 2021 with
the High Five strategic program. This set out five focus areas to concentrate on to build a better business. These five areas
comprise: (1) Grow High Tech, (2) Grow Green Tech, (3) More Service, (4) Grow APAC & Americas and (5) More

**_Focus on growth in High Tech and Green Tech markets_**

We aim to utilize our strong technological capabilities and innovative solutions to capture the growing demand
from customers in the High Tech and Green Tech markets, such as, Data Centers, HVAC, Carbon Capture Storage,
Renewable Energy and LNG. These vertical markets are characterized by high growth potential, complex requirements,
and stringent quality standards, which create attractive opportunities for us as a reliable and flexible partner. We plan to
expand our presence in these vertical markets by developing new solutions and applications, enhancing our customer
relationships, and pursuing selective acquisitions that complement our portfolio and geographic footprint.

**_Continue to grow our Service business_**

We intend to leverage our large installed product and customer base to continue to grow our Service business. For
example, we are focused on improving the organizational setup of our Service business across our product groups by
establishing dedicated service responsibilities and pooling service skills across product groups in certain regions and
increasing transparency. In KTS, we are considering strategic cooperations with specialist service providers to drive our
service business coverage and support our strategic objectives to benefit from robust growth in our strategic pillars and
vertical markets. This way we can utilize our product and engineering knowledge with a technical service partner who has
a strong market foothold that we can leverage.

**_Increase market share in the Americas and APAC region_**

We intend to continue to focus on the growth of our global platform and improve our market share in the Americas
and APAC regions through investment in production capacity and local dedicated sales teams. For example, we aim to
leverage our scale to further penetrate existing markets and strengthen our positions in China, India and the United States,
by capitalizing on strong and growing demand in our Data Center business in the Americas as well as in our HVAC and
Carbon Capture Storage solutions in Green Tech market applications. In RT and MCS, we intend to increase production
capacity and optimize production locations in the United States as well as build up a dedicated sales team for the
Transportation market. In the APAC region, we plan to continue to focus on product localization in the region and investing
in our sales and distribution networks.

**_Continue to reduce complexity and focus on digitalization to drive operational excellence_**

We continue to pursue our strategy of operational excellence by reducing complexity and enhancing digitalization
across our functional and business areas. This means focusing on activities like “80/20” where we seek to improve the
profitability of our product range, optimizing SAP in key locations, reducing process complexity through digital tools such
as Tagetik (our financial consolidation tool) and SAP (our core ERP). We also continue to deploy tools such as Power BI
to help us, for example, manage inventory reduction and improve our supply chain management globally. In addition, we
are exploring the use of Artificial Intelligence to support our sales and engineering processes, along with implementing
SAP CPQ and LO-VC. We continue to focus on the optimization of our operational footprint, especially in EMEA region,
and ensure we are manufacturing the right products in the right place for cost optimization and customer requirements.

**Trading Update**

Based on preliminary management accounts, we estimate that revenue for the months April and May 2024
amounted to approximately €258.8 million (compared to approximately €217.6 million for April and May 2023) and
EBITDA for the months April and May 2024 amounted to approximately €32.1 million (compared to approximately €21.9
million for April and May 2023). The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a strong development in the EMEA,
offsetting slightly lower revenue in the Americas and APAC. EBITDA increased at a higher rate than revenue driven by
favorable changes in product mix. The result of April and May 2024 includes expenses of €4.1 million for restructuring in
Germany (PHE).

_The preliminary financial data of the Group as of and for the months of April and May 2024 presented above has_
_been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management. Our independent auditors have not audited, reviewed,_
_compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the unaudited preliminary financial data shown above,_
_nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such data and assume no responsibility for, and_
_disclaim any association with, the unaudited preliminary financial data. Such information has been derived from_
_management accounts, is preliminary and is subject to our financial closing procedures. While we believe such preliminary_
_financial data to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from and differences could be material. As such, you should_
_not place undue reliance on this information, and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the_
_remainder of the year or any future period. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Offering Memorandum for additional_
_information and descriptions of various factors that could affect our future performance._

**Recent Developments**

In April 2024, we decided to reduce production capacity at two of our German production facilities in PHE. The
capacity reduction reflects lower demand for heat pumps in Europe and, in particular, in Germany following a recent
decrease in energy prices as well as regulatory uncertainty. We expect that the capacity reduction will impact approximately
150 employees and have booked a provision in a mid-single digit million amount to cover expected costs and expenses.

**Outlook**

_The following discussion has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, the management of the Issuer and is_
_solely based on a large number of estimates and projections, including, among others, with respect to economic conditions,_
_realizable sales prices and market growth projections, all of which are inherently uncertain, and operating data used by_
_management. There can be no assurance that these estimates will be realized or that actual results will not be higher or_
_lower than estimated. The following discussion is further based on a number of assumptions, including, among others, no_
_significant deterioration of economic and political conditions in the markets in which the Group operates, no significant_
_disruptions in the supply chain relevant to the business of the Group, no material price increases of raw materials, no_
_unexpected changes in governmental regulations worldwide, no significant slippage in customer purchase order_
_placement, no significant further softening in European heat pump market, continued growth in our Americas and APAC_
_regions and consistency of foreign exchange rates._

Based on our budget for 2024, we estimate an increase in order intake to approximately €1,750 million and an
increase in revenue to approximately €1,600 million. We estimate Normalized EBITDA for 2024 to significantly exceed
the prior year. Our budgeted revenue increase is broad-based, with all segments contributing, and is based on the high order
backlog, and expected order intake. We anticipate strongest revenue growth in KTS, followed by RT, both driven by strong
Data Centre grow, and we estimate moderate growth in MCS and PHE.

**The Transactions**

The Issuer estimates that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €425.0 million. The Issuer intends to use
the gross proceeds from the Offering (i) to redeem the Existing Notes in full, (ii) for general corporate purposes, including
expenses expected to be incurred in connection with a production footprint alignment program in the EMEA region as well
as certain capital expenditures and (iii) to pay costs, fees and expenses related to the Transactions (as defined below).

outstanding under and subsequent cancellation of the Existing L/G Facility Agreement and the Existing RCF Facility
Agreement and the entry into the Super Senior Facilities Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the
“Transactions.”

Management SCA holds 10% of the share capital in TES LuxCO S.à r.l. and certain members of senior management of KTS, in turn, hold
approximately 78% of the shares in TESCO Management SCA, with the remaining approximately 22% being held by Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l.

Russia-Ukraine Conflict, Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC was ringfenced and a disposal process is currently being pursued. Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC
and its subsidiaries will therefore be designated “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under the Indenture. In addition, Enexio Poland Sp. z o.o. as well as
its subsidiaries will also be designated as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under the Indenture and, consequently, these Unrestricted subsidiaries will
not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the aggregated revenue,
aggregated EBITDA and aggregated total assets, each calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding intra-group profits, of Kelvion
Mashimpeks LLC and its subsidiaries together represented 1.1%, 1.6% and 1.2% of our consolidated revenue, EBITDA and total assets,
respectively. While no separate financial information for Enexio Poland Sp. z o.o. is available for the year ended December 31, 2023, we believe
that the company is non-operating and does not have any significant revenue.

after the issuance of the Notes that would impose withholding taxes on the
payments on the Notes and would require the Issuer or any Guarantor to pay
Additional Amounts (as described in “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes”), the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at_
a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”


**Tender Offers................................ In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than**

90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any
third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third
party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but
not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each
other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Change of Control ........................ If the Issuer experiences a Change of Control, the holders of the Notes will have**

the right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price
equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. See “Description of the
_Notes—Change of Control.”_

14


-----

**Original Issue Discount ................** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for US federal

income tax purposes. In such event, holders subject to US federal income tax will
generally be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as
it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) for US federal income tax purposes
in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such OID is attributable and
regardless of the holder’s regular method of accounting for US federal income tax
purposes. See “Taxation—Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations—
_Original Issue Discount.”_

**Certain Covenants ........................ The Indenture will limit, among other things, the ability of the Issuer and its**

restricted subsidiaries to:

                 - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

                 - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make other distributions;

                 - make certain other restricted payments or restricted investments;

                 - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

                 - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                 - impose restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends;

                 - transfer or sell certain assets;

                 - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                 - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and

                 - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we achieve
investment grade ratings. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” Each of the_
covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Transfer Restrictions ................... The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under**

US federal or state or any foreign securities laws and are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer is under no
obligation to, nor does it intend to, register the Notes or the Guarantees in the
United States.


**Absence of a Public Market for**

**the Notes ....................................**


The Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market.
Although the Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a
market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue
market-making at any time without notice. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure
you as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. Furthermore,
the Notes will not have registration rights under the US Securities Act.


**Risk Factors .................................. Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should consider carefully all**

the information in this Offering Memorandum and, in particular, you should
evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section before
making a decision whether to invest in the Notes.

**Listing ............................................ Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited**

(the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is no
assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that
such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be
maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any

15

time, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the Trustee, de-list the
Notes from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of the Notes
to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers. See “Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants—Maintenance of Listing.”_

laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by the
laws of England and Wales. The Security Documents (as defined herein) will be

(1) Adjusted Revenue is defined as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 (€931.7 million) less revenue attributable to the Medupi project
(€38.8 million), a GEA legacy project from 2008, which management considers to be of a one-off nature and not reflective of the Group’s underlying
operative performance. The Medupi project was completed in 2021 and therefore Adjusted Revenue is presented for the year ended December 31,
2021 only.

(2) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) before depreciation, amortization, impairment losses and reversal of impairment
losses on non-current assets. EBITDA is not a defined financial measure under IFRS. It should be noted in this context that not all companies
calculate the items that are not defined under IFRS in the same manner, and that consequently the measures reported are not necessarily comparable
with similarly described measures employed by other companies. EBITDA margin, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2021, defined as
EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue and, with respect to the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, defined as EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a reconciliation of EBITDA for the

(3) Normalized EBITDA is defined as is defined as EBITDA as adjusted for certain non-recurring effects. Normalized EBITDA is not a defined
financial measure under IFRS. Normalized EBIT is defined as Normalized EBITDA less depreciation, amortization, impairment losses and reversal
of impairment losses on non-current assets. It should be noted in this context that not all companies calculate the items that are not defined under
IFRS in the same manner, and that consequently the measures reported are not necessarily comparable with similarly described measures employed
by other companies. Normalized EBITDA as presented below may differ from, and may not be comparable to, “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined
in the “Description of the Notes” and the Indenture. Normalized EBITDA margin is, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2021, defined as
Normalized EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue and, with respect to the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, defined as Normalized EBITDA divided by revenue. Below is a

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, KTS was carved out to a separate subgroup of legal entities in connection with a potential sale of KTS’ business.
The adjustment relates to corresponding consulting, legal and stamp-duty costs (€5.4 million in 2021 and €3.2 million in 2022). As part of this
strategic realignment, inventories and certain assets were impaired (€0.2 million in each of 2021 and 2022) and the decision was made to close
the production for MCS and KTS in Pune, India, which led to severance costs. The adjustment also includes €0.2 million of personnel expenses
in 2022 related to the transition period from the former CEO and current CEO.

(c) Relates to severance payments for redundancies in our sales team in connection with key customer prioritization initiatives and the
digitalization of order processing.

(d) Relate to various measures and initiatives agreed in connection with the Group’s refinancing in 2019, including reorganization and downsizing
of KTS in Spain, the exit of MCS production in India and capacity adjustments for KTS in France.

(e) Relate to initiatives in MCS, RT and PHE in the United States, including changes to the product portfolio in MCS, a shift in product focus to
dry coolers for data center and HVAC applications in RT as well as the relocation of PHE business operations to Knoxville, Tennessee. In
2022, the adjustment mainly relates to inventory write-offs (€7.4 million).

(f) Relates primarily to the sale of the Dry Cooling Systems (DCS) business. DCS Heller was sold in December 2020, followed by the sale of the
cooling tower service business in October 2021 and the sale of certain assets of the air-cooled condenser business (DCS-ACC) in March 2022.
The remaining DCS-ACC business was wound down. In 2021, the adjustment relates to other operating income from the reversal of provisions
related to the winding down of the DCS-ACC business (€17.7 million). In 2022, the adjustment includes €0.4 million for severance payments
and €0.2 million for consulting costs related to the winding down of the DCS-ACC business. In January 2022, we divested the ENEXIO Water
Business, and the associated consulting expenses and impairment of assets held for sale due to the lower than anticipated selling price (€1.6
million) were normalized in 2021. In 2022, the adjustment also includes a warranty provision of €1.4 million for a potential claim in Germany.

(g) The adjustment comprises severance payments, impairment of inventories, consulting expenses and provision releases in relation to initiatives
across various product groups and sales entities.

(h) Relates to the litigation proceedings with former bondholders of the Galapagos group. Legal costs amounted to €11.5 million in 2023, of
which €3.6 million had already accrued prior to 2021. Two settlement payments, in each case in the amount of €2.5 million, were made in
December 2023 and in March 2024.

(i) Relates to legal and notary fees of €2.0 million in connection with the Group’s refinancing in 2019, with the adjustment made in 2021 as well
as consulting expenses related to the extension of the revolving credit facility and associated consulting services in November 2023 and
January 2024.

(j) Relates the sale of the building and land in France, which resulted in a gain of €1.5 million in 2021 and €4.8 million in 2023 (with a purchase
price of €8.0 million). The purchase receivable was factored and a corresponding liability was recognized. In 2021, the adjustment includes
the effect from the sale of non-current assets in Sarstedt, Germany (€0.1 million).

(k) Relates to a GEA legacy project from 2008. ENEXIO contracted a construction of a dry cooling solution for a power station in Lephalale,
South Africa. As part of the purchase price allocation, we recognized a provision of €49.3 million for the estimated risks associated with the
project as well as a corresponding receivable from a reimbursement right (70% of the respective provision, €35.5 million). Following the
decision of a final court in 2021, the remaining provision of €18.3 million was released.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes to be issued in the Offering involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other_
_information contained in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before_
_purchasing the Notes. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our results of operations and financial_
_condition could be materially and adversely affected and accordingly the value of the Notes, which in turn could adversely_
_affect the Issuer’s ability to repay the Notes. The risks described herein are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect_
_our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and, thus our ability to fulfil our obligations under the_
_Notes and the Guarantees. In any such case, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on Notes when due and you_
_may lose all or part of your investment in the Notes._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various_
_factors, including the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking_
_Statements.”_

**Risks Related to our Business and Industry**

**_We are exposed to risks associated with changes in global economic conditions and economic developments in the_**
**_countries in which we operate_**

As a global manufacturer of heat exchangers and other cooling & heating products, we are exposed to risks
associated with fluctuations in the global economy. A slowdown in the global economy and elevated levels of private and
public debt in various countries may cause demand to decline in our key markets. The situation may be exacerbated by
protectionist tendencies, persistently elevated levels of inflation, uncertainties regarding future monetary policy, armed
conflicts that remain unresolved and related migration trends, as well as the spread of infectious diseases. Some recent
developments which have significantly impacted global macroeconomic conditions include the ongoing military conflicts
in the Ukraine (the “Russia-Ukraine Conflict”), the conflict in Gaza and attacks by Houthi rebels on merchant shipping
vessels in the southern Red Sea region as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. See also “—The COVID-19 pandemic had an
_adverse effect on our revenue and profitability, cash flow and liquidity, growth plans and prospects, and any future_
_pandemic or other public health incidents could also have similar effects” and “—The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the_
_sanctions imposed by numerous countries and multinational entities in response, as well as countermeasures by Russia,_
_have had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on the global economy, the global capital markets, supply chains,_
_energy prices and supplies, any of which could negatively impact our operations.”_

The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the sanctions and export control measures instituted by the European Union (the
“EU”), the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan, among others, contributed to increased inflationary
pressures (including increased prices for oil and natural gas), gas supply shortages, supply chain disruptions, market
volatility and economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe. The inflationary environment and related intensified general
price increases (in particular due to rising energy costs), combined with an increase in interest rates, resulted in a slowdown
of customer demand and thus would have had an impact on our growth. While we may increase product prices in order to
mitigate the impact of inflation and increases in energy costs, competitive pressures may constrain our ability to do so and
we may remain subject to market risks with respect to inflationary pressures. Furthermore, increasing inflation has put
upward pressure on the cost of raw materials (see “—Increases in raw material prices, energy costs and prices for input
_materials and intermediate products may result in higher manufacturing or purchasing costs and lower margins, and we_
_may not be able to pass such increased costs on to our customers fully or at all”) and other operating costs, and our ability_
to raise prices to counteract increased raw materials prices and other operating costs (such as labor costs) may be limited,
which may reduce our operating profit to the extent where we are not able to pass on related price increases to our
customers. In addition, our initiatives, in particular the enforcement of price adjustment clauses in our customer contracts,
to mitigate headwinds from inflation in our raw materials and other operating costs may not be sufficient to offset these
risks.

As part of the capital goods industry, we are also exposed to fluctuations in the overall investment climate. Among
other things, fluctuations in growth rates or forecasts of gross domestic product, interest rate environments and alterations
in government investment subsidies, can result in significant changes in demand for capital goods in the markets in which
we operate, potential cancellations of orders already booked or the reorganization of longer-term business relationships.
Therefore, our revenue and results of operations are influenced, and will continue to be influenced, by macroeconomic
trends and the general state and performance of the global economy. Moreover, uncertainty in connection with trade
tensions between the United States and China and further changes to the trade policy of the United States may have a
material adverse effect on the overall economies of EU countries and other markets in which we operate, including APAC
and MEA. The uncertain political development in the United States and potential restrictions and limitations impacting
international trade may have a negative impact on the export economy in general, and on our results of operations in
particular. If individual countries take increasingly protectionist measures to improve their competitiveness in the global

23


-----

market and other countries introduce countermeasures, this may result in market access barriers, such as higher import
duties or more complicated certification processes in order to reduce imports.

Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results
of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability, cash flow and liquidity, growth plans_**
**_and prospects, and any future pandemic or other public health incidents could also have similar effects._**

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant macroeconomic uncertainty, volatility and disruption and had
serious adverse economic consequences, including declining economic growth, numerous business insolvencies and
significantly increased unemployment. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures imposed to contain the
outbreak of the disease, particularly in Europe and the United States, our business operations experienced delays and
disruptions, including, but not limited to, supply chain interruptions and delays in delivery of products or projects to some
of our customers.

Potential impacts of any further outbreaks of disease or other public health threats in the future include but are not
limited to: (i) staffing shortages if portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines,
government actions, facility closures, or other restrictions; (ii) short- or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and our
ability to deliver products to our customers; (iii) deterioration in the markets that we or our customers operate in, which
may result in lower sales or a lack in the ability of our customers to pay us; and (iv) significant volatility or negative
pressure in the financial markets, which could adversely affect our access to capital and/or financing. Any adverse effect
on our ability to access capital and/or secure financing could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks
described in this “Risk Factors” section and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the sanctions imposed by numerous countries and multinational entities in response,_**
**_as well as countermeasures by Russia, have had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on the global economy, the_**
**_global capital markets, supply chains, energy prices and supplies, any of which could negatively impact our operations._**

The Russia-Ukraine Conflict prompted the EU and numerous countries to impose sanctions on a range of Russian
and Belarusian state and corporate entities and individuals, including extensive trade embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes
and the exclusion of certain Russian and Belarusian banks from the global financial system, among other measures. In
response, Russia has sanctioned persons and entities within so-called “non-friendly” countries and terminated gas supply
contracts with several countries and entities in Europe. The unpredictable nature of the conflict means that further sanctions,
against Russia and Belarus (or Russian and Belarusian entities) and further retaliatory actions by Russia and Belarus against
the imposing countries, including the possible expropriation of assets owned by nationals of, or companies based in, such
sanctioning countries, including us, may be forthcoming.

While we have a subsidiary in Russia, sales in the region were ceased in January 2023 and the Russian subsidiary’s
operations were ringfenced for disposal in May 2023. A disposal process is currently being pursued. However, there can
be no assurance if and at which terms such disposal may be completed. Under Russian law, among other things, any
disposal is required to be made at a discount compared to a valuation prepared by an approved valuer and subject to
government approval. For the time being, the Russian entity operates under its own brand name and has established its own
supply chain. In addition, in October 2022, we ceased all trading with Belarus. In the year ended December 31, 2023,
Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC (our Russian subsidiary) accounted for 1.1% (€16.0 million) of our total revenue. However, our
business, financial condition and results of operations have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by
the Russia-Ukraine Conflict in a number of ways. The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and the related sanctions have created
significant global economic uncertainty and have threatened to exacerbate pre-existing global economic challenges such
as those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, increasing inflation (including energy prices) and
slowing economic growth. The conflict and the related sanctions have also caused and may continue to cause volatility in
oil and natural gas prices and could potentially lead to shortages or further energy price increases of these resources. These
developments have caused and may continue to cause significant increases in energy prices which, in turn, impact our input
costs. In addition, the conflict has provoked a significant return home of Ukraine labour employed in different European
countries, creating labour availability tension in some industries, notably manufacturing and transportation.

If any of the foregoing risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability
to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees could be materially and adversely affected. Such risks may
also have the effect of heightening other risks, such as those relating to inflation, capital markets volatility and our ability
to access additional capital, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. We, our suppliers or our customers may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient financing, including
working capital financing, and credit insurance.

24


-----

Our working capital requirements can vary, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers’
production, and the payment terms with its customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our
suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or on delivery. If our available cash
flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash
balances and availability for borrowings to satisfy those needs, as well as potential additional sources of capital, which
may not be available on satisfactory terms, in sufficient amount or at all. There can be no assurance that we, our suppliers
or our customers will continue to have such ability. This may increase the risk that we cannot produce our products or will
have to pay higher prices for our inputs. These higher prices may not be recovered in our selling prices.

**_Certain industries and end-markets we serve are cyclical and our results may be adversely impacted by such cycles and_**
**_negative developments._**

We serve a variety of end-markets, including, Data Centers, HVAC, Power & Energy, Oil & Gas, and Heavy &
Light Industry. Demand for our products and services is dependent on the levels of investment in these end-markets and
industries, which, in turn, is affected by a number of macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth and GDP, levels
of capital investments, inflation and interest rates as well as the availability of credit and financing. These industries and
end-markets are also characterized by different trends and market drivers. A negative development in any of our primary
end-markets, particularly in Data Centers, could have a negative impact on our business, financial position and results of
operations. Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Changes in government spending and legislative actions and initiatives relating to renewable energy and electric power_**
**_may adversely affect demand for our products and services._**

Demand for our products and services may be negatively impacted by changes in government spending and
renewable energy policies and initiatives. Many countries in which we operate have, or are considering, mandates that
require specified percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources. In addition, some countries are considering
limits on both the development of new nuclear power plants and on the continued operation of existing nuclear power
plants following environmental incidents. Subsidies of renewable energy sources could result in reduced investment in
conventional power plants, which tend to be more heat exchanger-intensive than many of the renewable energy
technologies currently deployed. Furthermore, the continuing political discussion relating to the future energy mix (among
other jurisdictions, in Germany) could lead to delayed investment decisions or to reduced investments by our customers,
in particular in the oil and gas and energy sectors, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
For example, in the year ended December 31, 2023, 11.6% of our revenue resulted from sales to customers in the Power &
Energy and, therefore, policy changes in connection with transitions to renewable energy sources could have an adverse
impact on our revenue and results of operations. In addition, demand for products in PHE is affected by demand for heat
pumps and has been negatively impacted by regulatory uncertainty in relation to the phase out of conventional heating
systems since the end of 2023. Any further changes in government spending and renewable energy policies and initiatives
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees if they result in reduced demand for our products and services in traditional coal, nuclear and
gas-fired power plants.

**_We may be unable to successfully implement ongoing and future improvement programs and may incur additional costs_**
**_in connection with such programs._**

We have in the past implemented, and intend to continue to implement, improvement programs aimed at aligning
our production capacities with the demand in the relevant end-markets by closing certain manufacturing sites and
transferring the manufacturing to other sites. For example, we stopped production at our site in Wingles, France, which
had been loss-making for a number of years, in 2023, as the market of heat pumps, which experienced a boom as a result
of the energy crisis at the beginning of 2022, has experienced decline. In connection with the closure of the production in
Wingles, France, we agreed a redundancy plan and incurred other closure costs in an aggregate amount of €14.0 million in
the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. We are also evaluating certain other footprint alignment
programs in the EMEA region, e.g. in Western Europe, which could result in the closure of additional sites and redundancy
plans. In particular, we are in the final stage of assessing a footprint reduction for one site in Western Europe and expect
to conclude this assessment in the near future. While no definitive decision has been taken as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we currently estimate that the closure costs (including costs relating to the termination of leases and
relocation costs) as well as redundancy costs will amount to approximately €25 million to €30 million and the total costs
will amount to approximately €52 million, which will be – directly or indirectly – funded from the proceeds of the offering
of the Notes. See “Use of Proceeds.” However, our actual costs may be significantly higher due to a number of factors,
some of which are beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement the planned
restructuring measures on time, for example due to the need to find an agreement with employee representatives or
landlords.

25


-----

In addition, even if we are able to implement our footprint alignment program as planned, there can be no
assurance that such measures result in the efficiency gains or cost savings currently anticipated by us. We may, for example,
experience delays in ramping up production at our new sites or such sites may not be as efficient as anticipated due to
factors such as availability and skills of the local workforce and the need to use new suppliers. Furthermore, a reduction of
our labor force at the affected sites could adversely affect our business, e.g., through strikes, lawsuits, business interruptions
or reputational damage.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material and adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations, which could in turn adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We face country risks in the regions in which we operate, including in emerging markets._**

We are active in numerous countries worldwide. We have a global production footprint, with production sites in
more than 20 countries around the world, including Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
France, Spain, Poland, the Czech Republic, Qatar, South Africa, India and China, as well as service and engineering hubs
in additional jurisdictions. Our operations in any of the countries in which we operate, and particularly in emerging markets,
are subject to the following risks:

      - changes in the rate of economic growth;

      - unsettled political or economic conditions;

      - expropriation or other governmental actions;

      - war and social unrest;

      - terrorist attacks or other armed conflicts;

      - bribery and corruption;

      - national and regional labor strikes;

      - confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies,

      - deprivation of contract rights;

      - trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;

      - reduced protection of intellectual property rights;

      - restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;

      - exchange controls;

      - inflation;

      - currency fluctuations and devaluation;

      - the effect of global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions;

      - market opportunities and operating restrictions; and

      - changes in financial policy and availability of credit.

Moreover, financial and political turmoil in an emerging market may adversely affect the economic conditions of
other emerging markets or countries in the region, as investors may move their money to more stable, developed markets.

The uncertainty over whether governments will implement changes in policies or regulations affecting these or
other factors in the future may contribute to economic uncertainty in such markets. Furthermore, the performance of
emerging market economies has historically been affected by the political climate in these countries. Political crises have
had a negative impact on the confidence of investors and the public in general, and they have adversely affected the
economic development of these countries.

In addition, we may conduct business with customers or service or agency partners in countries that are subject to
export control regulations, trade embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions imposed by the United
States, the European Union or other countries or multilateral organizations. It is possible that any expansion into or within
sanctioned countries could adversely impact our ability to gain or retain investors, customers or suppliers or result in
reputational harm or other adverse consequences. Further, should legal developments require us to modify or terminate our
activities in such countries, we may be exposed to customer complaints or contractual remedies or other adverse
consequences. Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We generate a significant amount of Order Intake and revenue from a limited number of large customers._**

Although our customer base is large, we depend on certain large customers for a significant proportion of our
revenue and Order Intake. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest customers generated
approximately 46% of our Order Intake (year ended December 31, 2022: approximately 32%), with the largest customer
generating approximately 25% of Order Intake in the year ended December 31, 2023 (year ended December 31, 2022:
approximately 20%). Furthermore, our largest customer generated approximately 18% of our revenue in the year ended
December 31, 2023.

The loss of all or a substantial portion of our business with any of our largest customers, and in particular our
largest customer, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We
may make fewer business with these customers for a number of reasons, including but not limited to:

      - reduced demand for our customers’ products or services, including, in particular, as a result of cyclical
downturns that disproportionately affect our customers’ industries;

      - failure to deliver products or solutions that meet our customers’ specifications and our contractual
obligations;

      - technological changes;

      - reduced or delayed customer requirements; or

      - bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer.

Any significant change in the revenue or Order Intake we generate from our largest customers could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may not be able to realize revenues represented by our Order Intake and Order Backlog._**

We present Order Intake and Order Backlog as operational key performance indicators in this Offering
Memorandum. Order Intake refers to binding customer contracts and purchase orders concluded and received in the
respective reporting period at the respective price, while Order Backlog refers to the binding customer contracts and
purchase orders concluded and the portion of the associated transaction price for which the amount of sales has not yet
been recognized in accordance with IFRS. See “Summary Financial and Other Information—Order Intake and Order
_Backlog”. There can be no assurance that these contractual terms will remain unchanged, or that the order intake or order_
backlog will result in an actual recognition of revenue within the period initially anticipated, if at all. We may experience
variances in the realization of estimated Order Intake and Order Backlog because of delays or cancellations, scope
adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. In addition, many of our contracts grant
the customer the right to change, delay or cancel purchase orders at any time after they have been placed against the
payment of proven damages suffered by us as a result of such change, delay or cancellation or, in certain cases, against
payment of fixed contractual penalties. If the estimated Order Intake or Order Backlog fails to materialize as anticipated,
this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to fulfill
our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Our Order Intake and Order Backlog does not provide a precise
indication of the time period over which we are contractually entitled to receive such revenue and there is no assurance
that such revenues will be actually received within the anticipated timeframes or at all. Our Order Intake and Order
Backlog are computed based on facts known and assumptions deemed appropriate at the computation date.

Our definition of Order Intake and Order Backlog may not necessarily be the same as that used by other
companies engaged in activities similar to us. As a result, the amount of Order Intake and Order Backlog reported by us
may not be comparable to similar metrics reported by such other companies.

**_We are exposed to intense competition and our competitive position may deteriorate._**

The market for heat exchangers in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with both large
international market participants and numerous smaller regional and local suppliers that vary depending on the region.
See also “Business—Competition.” Our competitive position also varies in the individual product sub-markets (such as
for different types of heat exchangers and cooling towers) and regions. If we are unable to continue to provide our
services to existing clients, to develop new service portfolios, to attract new clients, to respond to client trends, to increase
our operating efficiency and to reduce our operating and overhead costs, we may not be able to successfully compete in
the relevant markets. Furthermore, in many of the markets in which we compete, customers place a strong emphasis on
local manufacturing capabilities, and we may be unable to quickly expand our manufacturing capacities as required in
certain fast growing segments, and thus lose market share. Any expansion undertaken in markets which are generally
characterized by lower costs of production may lead to more intense competition in those markets. Should we fail to
maintain our market position in the relevant markets or build-up a meaningful market position in new markets, this could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

Any development in markets in which we operate is determined to a certain extent by technological changes
and innovation and our strategy is therefore particularly directed towards being perceived as a technology leader in the
respective markets. This requires continuous investments in research and development. Despite our efforts and
investments, existing or new competitors may develop their products and technologies further or create alternative ones
that are more attractively priced, offer higher quality or a broader functionality or are more appealing than our products
for other reasons. Furthermore, our research and development efforts may be insufficient to ensure that we are able to
meet our customers’ demands on time, or we may be unable to meet product specifications due to a lack of research and
development expertise. Additionally, our existing competitors and new entrants may have greater operational, financial
and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to develop new products and compete for opportunities and,
as a result, our business may be less successful. If new or more advanced products can be offered at more attractive
prices, or if such products are more attractive than our products for other reasons, such as greater functionality, demand
for our products could fall, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

Some of our customers and end customers are facing increasing pricing pressure and could be affected by costcutting pressures. If our competitors are able to offer products at prices significantly below ours or if new low-cost
competitors enter the market, we may be unable to reduce our costs or offer similar pricing, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We depend on the ability to maintain the quality of our products and processes and to develop and manufacture new_**
**_products in a timely manner in line with market trends and the pace of technological development._**

Our success depends on our ability to recognize market trends and technological changes and to develop new
and improved products and product applications to the market in a timely manner. We invest in technology, new
materials and innovation which we believe will be critical to our long-term growth and we must continually adapt our
expertise in response to changes in megatrends, emerging technological innovations, industry standards and customer
requirements or preferences. In addition, digitalization is progressing rapidly and has already transformed certain
sectors. The pace of implementation and adaptation represents an important success factor in this regard and, therefore,
also a risk. For customers, one of the determining factors in purchasing our components and systems is the quality of
our products and manufacturing processes. Our products are often mission-critical for the applications in which they are
used. Given that products that have already been introduced in the market are subject to risks related to the product quality
expected by customers, a decrease in the actual and perceived quality of these products and processes could damage our
image and reputation, as well as those of our products.

There can be no assurance that (i) we will be successful in developing new products or solutions or in bringing
them to market in a timely manner, (ii) products or technologies developed by competitors will not render our offerings
less competitive, (iii) customers will not substitute our products with those of competitors or alternate technologies,
(iv) we will be able to anticipate our customers’ needs and provide products to meet those needs or (v) we will be able
to adjust our cost structure in the event of contraction of demand. Should we fail to develop appropriate strategies as a
response to these or similar market trends or not be able to enhance existing products, develop new products or keep
pace with developing technology, growth opportunities or existing customers could be lost. Furthermore, if we devote
resources to the development of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the market or that fail to be
commercially viable, all or part of these research and development expenses may be lost and our business may suffer.

The materialization of any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Increases in raw material prices, energy costs and prices for input materials and intermediate products may result in_**
**_higher manufacturing or purchasing costs and lower margins, and we may not be able to pass on such increased costs_**
**_to our customers fully or at all._**

We are exposed to risks relating to the availability, quality and cost of raw materials, energy and intermediate
products. In particular, we require various metals such as steel, copper, aluminum and titanium. The market price and
availability of these products that we use for our operations can fluctuate sharply depending on the market situation. For
example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant fluctuations in the price of copper on the London Metal
Exchange, with a decrease of up to 20% around the outbreak and spread of the pandemic followed by significant price
increases in the subsequent two years. A shortage of raw materials and energy sources could also arise from decreases
in extraction and production due to natural disasters or political instability or unrest in extracting and producing
countries. In addition, since many of these materials, in particular copper and aluminum, are usually purchased in U.S.
dollars, a stronger U.S. dollar could represent a further price risk for companies that are outside of the United States and
whose operating currency is not tied to the U.S. dollar. In addition, certain countries may impose anti-dumping policies
on imports of specific materials from third countries, thereby rendering the cost effectiveness no longer competitive.

Currently, we do not use commodity derivatives as hedging instruments against price fluctuations of raw materials.
Although we have entered into longer-term supply agreements with various suppliers in order to reduce commodity price
risk, we are not fully shielded from the risk of rising commodity prices. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and
may continue to experience in the future, material cost increases at the time of purchasing the necessary raw materials for
a project as compared to the time when we negotiated the contract for the project. As we may not be able to pass price
increases on to our customers, such price increases could reduce our profit margins. However, if we are able to pass price
increases on to our customers, this could reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, supply
interruptions of production materials, resulting from shortages, labor strikes, supplier insolvencies or other factors could
have a negative effect as well.

In addition, we also rely on a variety of intermediate products produced by other manufacturers that are integrated
into the final products that we provide to the end-customer. These include finished mechanical components such as fans
and chiller units. Should our suppliers raise prices, this will result in higher costs. In addition, if we experience limited
availability or quality issues with our suppliers of these intermediate products, we could be forced to seek alternative
suppliers that may charge higher prices and cause delays in delivering products to customers. These delays and higher costs
may also have a negative effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may be required to perform portions of our projects locally or source materials from certain countries._**

Some countries in which we operate have regulations requiring, and some customers in foreign countries prefer, a
minimum degree of local content be included in projects in, or products destined for installation in, their country. For
example, certain customers require that we do not use products manufactured in a certain country (e.g., China or India),
source materials from local suppliers or that manufacturing take place at specific facilities (e.g., in Europe). These
requirements and preferences may require us to outsource significant functions to manufacturers in foreign countries or
otherwise to establish manufacturing capabilities in foreign countries, or to source raw materials, product parts or semifinished goods from countries that are not those from which we would normally source (e.g., due to lower manufacturing
costs) if such restrictions were not in place. These requirements may negatively impact our profit margins and result in
additional complexity and costs with respect to project management, which, in, turn, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_A disruption in our supply or delivery chain could cause us or one or more of our suppliers or customers to halt_**
**_production._**

As a global manufacturer of heat exchangers and other cooling & heating products, we rely on global supply
chains, which are prone to disruptions. These disruptions may result from many reasons, including closures of supplier
facilities or critical manufacturing facilities due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions,
public health crises as well as logistical complications resulting from weather, other natural disasters or armed conflicts,
mechanical failures and delayed customs processing. The lack of a subcomponent or raw material necessary to manufacture
one of our products could require us to prolong our production period. For example, in the past, we have experienced
temporary supply shortages or constraints in copper and fans which resulted in extended lead times. Risks may also arise
in the course of significant projects, including risks beyond our control. These may include problems in contract design,
the miscalculation of orders, changes in economic and technical conditions, flaws in project management or inadequate
performance by subcontractors. Even when products are ready to be shipped, or have been shipped, delays may arise before
they reach our customers. When we cease timely deliveries, we have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving
the cause of the problem, as well as expeditiously producing and shipping replacement products. In addition, any such

29


-----

disruption in our supply and delivery chains may result in a delay and trigger penalty payments under our customer
contracts. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are dependent on third parties for the delivery of raw materials as well as the distribution and delivery of our_**
**_products, and disruptions or delays may adversely affect our business._**

We depend on effective supply and distribution operations of third parties to obtain necessary inputs for our
production processes and to deliver our products to our customers. Damage or disruption to such supply or distribution
capabilities due to, among other things, weather, natural disasters, terrorism, political instability, public health crises, wars
and military conflicts, strikes or the financial instability of suppliers and distribution providers could impair our ability to
manufacture and deliver our products to customers in a timely manner. If our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations
under purchase orders or supply agreements, we may be unable to locate suitable alternatives, may be forced to pay higher
prices to obtain such inputs from other suppliers or even change suppliers. The unavailability, for whatever reason, of any
raw material or component required to manufacture our products could require us to decrease or suspend production
activities at one or more of our facilities, potentially for a prolonged period, and the risk of any such delay would be borne
by us. To the extent that we are unable to effectively manage such events if they occur, or cannot financially mitigate the
likelihood or potential impact of such events with respect to our suppliers and distributors, they could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes
and the Guarantees.

Our ability to provide our products to our customers depends on our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with
carriers, including trucking and shipping companies. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, adversely impacted global
transportation and logistics capacities in the face of increased demand for such services. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine
Conflict as well as the recent attacks by Houthi rebels on merchant shipping vessels in the southern Red Sea region has
exacerbated this situation, resulting in increased costs of transportation and logistics services, as well as supply chain
disruptions. The market has become more constrained, with transportation resources, including drivers of heavy goods
vehicles, becoming scarce and causing a corresponding increase in costs. To the extent that our third-party carriers increase
their rates in the future, including to reflect higher fuel, maintenance, labor or other costs due to increased inflation,
regulation, taxation or otherwise, we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers in a timely manner or at
all. Any material increases in our transport and distribution costs that we are unable to pass on to customers could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to risks in connection with our Research and Development activities._**

In order to maintain our competitiveness, we are required to continuously invest in new solutions, applications,
manufacturing technologies and products. If we devote resources to the pursuit of new solutions, applications,
manufacturing technologies or products that fail to be accepted in the marketplace or that fail to become commercially
viable, all or part of our research and development (“R&D”) costs may be lost. Furthermore, should we be unable to
secure sufficient funding to finance our R&D activities, we could lose our competitive position in a number of important
markets. We incurred €16.5 million in R&D expenses in the year ended December 31, 2023 (€14.0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022). See “Business—Research and Development.”

We also work with strategic partners in the area of research and development, when entering a new market and
in connection with large projects, in part within the framework of a partnership (for example, with construction
companies), and at other times by way of a cooperation arrangement (for example, with universities and research
institutions). In some cases, our partners provide a substantial portion of the capital resources for the project in question
or other material services. We, in turn, commit in the underlying agreements to perform certain activities in connection
with the project. If we fail to fulfill our obligations under the relevant partnership or cooperation agreements, either in
whole or in part, this may lead to claims for damages, contractual penalties or termination of the partnership or
cooperation agreement, as applicable, by our partners. In addition, the successful implementation of a project may be
endangered or impaired through a breach of contract by one of our partners or through unforeseen events. Moreover, the
success of a partnership or cooperation arrangement requires that the partners constructively pursue the same goals. In
our joint venture projects, certain intellectual property or proprietary information may (need to) be disclosed to joint
venture partners, who may use said technologies exclusively for their own purposes outside of the context of the project.
See also “—Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks—There is a risk that we may infringe the intellectual property
_rights of third parties.” In addition, in the event that we decide on a divestment of or withdrawal from a joint venture,_
there is a risk that no buyer will be found for the shares in the joint venture, there will be no other way to sell the shares
for other reasons or that the partner will claim damages. There is also a risk that, in the event of the loss of a joint venture
partner, we will need to invest considerable resources in a new partnership.

The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Changes in our product mix or our portfolio of large projects can have a significant impact on our profitability and profit_**
**_margins._**

Some of our products have higher profit margins than others. Some of our products also have a much higher
internally manufactured cost component. Therefore, changes in product mix from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year
can have a significant impact on our results of operations and profitability through a change in our manufacturing costs
and specifically in our manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue. In addition, certain large projects make up a
substantial portion of our revenue, and as these projects are phased out, this can also have a significant impact on our
reported revenue and margins for our product groups that are active in the project business (in particular KTS) from quarterto-quarter or from year-to-year. A change in our product mix and the timing of revenue recognition from large projects can
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our project business is subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our_**
**_trade working capital and results of operations._**

A considerable portion of our business is project-based, involving the delivery of engineered solutions for large
and often complex projects, and we may undertake additional large projects in the future. In particular, our business in
KTS, which is our largest product group by revenue, is largely project-based. Our customers may also require certain
upgrade projects for existing facilities with unforeseen complications. These projects and other efforts of this type are
subject to risks of cost overruns or delays inherent in any large project as a result of numerous factors, including, but not
limited to, the following:

    - shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;

    - work stoppages and labor disputes;

    - unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;

    - local customs strikes or related work slowdowns that could delay importation of equipment or materials;

    - weather interferences;

    - difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or approvals or in meeting permit or approval conditions;

    - design and engineering problems;

    - inadequate regulatory support infrastructure in the local jurisdiction;

    - unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials;

    - unanticipated actual or purported change orders;

    - client acceptance delays; and

    - failure or delay of third-party equipment vendors or service providers.

The risks described above are particularly relevant when we enter into long-term engineering contracts, which
represent a significant part of our business. Under some of these contracts, we assume a significant portion of the risk
associated with the project’s completion. In addition, these contracts may provide for warranty obligations that remain in
force for several years after the project’s completion. See also “Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks—We are exposed
_to product liability claims and the risk that our products may not fulfill customer requirements or specifications.”_

We have experienced and may continue to experience several performance and quality issues with the products,
components and services provided by subcontractors, which may substantially affect the cost of a project. In certain
industries, such as the petrochemical industry, the quality expectations are particularly high, leading to very intensive
service and labor costs, and poor-quality issues may more easily result in a deviation from the original cost calculation and
time schedule for a project. Payment schedules for our large projects can also have a significant impact on, and result in
volatility of our, liquidity and working capital position. We typically negotiate upfront and milestone payments which
result in cash inflows. Over time this advanced cash is reduced as projects are started and materials are purchased due to
requirements for the manufacturing of the equipment. Cash balances can also be impacted by the timing of payments and
earlier or delayed payments can have an impact.

The failure to complete an upgrade, refurbishment or new construction project on time, or at all, or the inability to
complete a project in accordance with its design specifications, may result in loss of revenues, penalties, or delay,
renegotiation or cancellation of a project contract. Additionally, capital expenditures for large upgrade, refurbishment and
construction projects could materially exceed our planned expenditures. If we experience substantial delays and cost
overruns in our projects, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations
and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our production and development processes are exposed to operational risks in the form of interruptions which may lead_**
**_to production bottlenecks or production downtime, as well as accidents, safety defects, defective performance, quality_**
**_defects or environmental incidents._**

As of the date of the Offering Memorandum, we have 22 production sites in more than more than 20 countries.
In addition, construction sites where we carry out projects pose specific safety risks. Operational disruptions or
interruptions at our facilities and sites may occur, including for reasons beyond our control (such as aircraft crashes,
terrorism, epidemics, political unrest, natural disasters or other acts of God) or for other reasons (such as fire, floods,
explosion, release of hazardous substances, or strikes, as well as interruptions relating to the supply of energy, raw
materials and pre-products or IT failures). For example, in recent years, we experienced delays in connection with
leakage on hydraulic press cylinders, resulting in temporary unplanned downtime, pressing tooling breakdowns and
brazing furnace problems with vacuum pumps. Furthermore, our facility in Knoxville, Tennessee, was recently damaged
following unusually heavy rainfall and we have been forced to reallocate production capacity to other plants, including
in Europe as a result. This is expected to result in production delays and increased costs.

Operational disruptions and interruptions and process weaknesses may lead to significant production
downtimes and interruptions relating to services provided and products delivered to customers. If disruptions occur,
alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may
take significant time to start or transfer production. Each of these scenarios could materially adversely affect our business
and financial performance. If any of our production facilities is unable to manufacture our products for an extended
period of time, our sales may decline due to the disruption and we may not be able to manufacture sufficient volumes of
products to meet our customers’ needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers.

In addition, our reputation and important customer relationships are dependent on our customers’ confidence in
the safety, quality and environmental compatibility of our services and projects. Actual or alleged accidents at projects,
safety defects, defective performance, quality defects or environmental incidents could lead to substantial financial liability
and could affect the demand for our products and services with resultant adverse financial consequences. Accidents
occurring during the execution of major projects can cause serious damage to persons and property and could permanently
damage our reputation in the public opinion, even if we were not actually responsible for causing such damage and no fault
can be attributed to us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations
and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to the potential default of contracting parties and credit risk._**

We are exposed to a risk of payment default by our customers who have agreed to purchase products from us,
by contracting parties with whom we or any of our subsidiaries work in consortiums or similar joint ventures, and other
partners and subcontractors. Trade receivables amounted to €158,880 thousand as of December 31, 2023. The amount
of overdue trade receivables is an indication of the risk that we run in connection with potential bad debts. As of
December 31, 2023, overdue trade and other receivables from third parties amounted to €43.1 million, or 27.1% of our
total receivables trade and other receivables from third parties, and bad debt allowances on our total trade receivables
amounted to €12.3 million. In the past, we have from time to time experienced payment default by certain customers that
were unable to pay for delivered goods due to financial difficulties. Even though we regularly collect credit information
on new customers and, if needed, on existing customers in an attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk, we may be
unsuccessful in identifying significant potential credit risks.

Additionally, other parties with whom we have entered into financial or other arrangements could also be in
default, e.g., in the event of their insolvency or where they have no access to credit facilities. For example, we have in
the past been unable to hold a supplier accountable for defective products due to the insolvency of the supplier.

The default of our customers or other contracting parties could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our business, in particular our project business, is dependent on financing being available to us, our customers and_**
**_our suppliers._**

We produce, in part, complex industrial products, and our customers require substantial own equity or borrowed
funds in order to finance such products. A significant portion of our business, in particular in KTS, consists of projects
that depend on financing being available to our customers. A general decline in demand or a shortage of available
financing opportunities may make it more difficult to implement such projects. Existing orders may be deferred or
cancelled, or customers may experience payment difficulties.

Our working capital requirements can vary, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our
customers’ production, and the payment terms agreed on with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be
adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or on
delivery or customers fail to pay or seek to renegotiate lower milestone payments. If our available cash flows from

32


-----

operating activities are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we will be required to look to our cash balances
and availability for borrowings to satisfy those needs, as well as potential additional sources of capital, which may not
be available on satisfactory terms, in sufficient amount or at all. There can be no assurance that we, our suppliers or our
customers will continue to have such ability. This may increase the risk that we will be unable to produce our products
or will have to pay higher prices for our inputs without being able to pass these higher prices on by way of our selling
prices.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations
and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our accounts receivables may remain outstanding for a significant period of time._**

Payment conditions, in particular due dates for payments by our customers, vary depending on the type of
contract and business. With respect to our component business, we record revenue and corresponding trade receivables
when products are delivered to customers, and with respect to certain products, when customer acceptance occurs
following delivery. Payments received prior to product delivery, or customer acceptance, as applicable, are recorded as
unearned revenue. Any payment delays cause capital to be tied up in receivables, which may result in pressure on our
cash flows and liquidity. We sell a portion of our trade receivables to financial services companies under a factoring
agreement; these are derecognized in our financial statements once the majority of the risks and rewards have been
substantially transferred to the financial services company. With respect to the project business, receivables and revenues
from construction contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method. Advance payments on
construction contracts are reported separately as a liability. Although we typically benefit from customer prepayments
for newly-awarded projects in our project business, we have experienced in the past and may in the future experience
payment delays or customers deciding to cease prepayments as a result of customers revising their trading terms.

We may experience low accounts receivable turnover and payment delays due to an unexpected abandonment
or delay of projects, cancelation of orders and payment delays from certain customers due to financial difficulties. Delays
in collections and the significant period of time our accounts receivable remain outstanding may negatively impact our
cash flow and liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our assets, such as goodwill, are subject to the risk of impairment. Potential negative changes in the value of our assets_**
**_may result in write-downs and therefore negatively affect our financial position._**

As of December 31, 2023, goodwill allocated to our cash-generating units and other intangible assets amounting to
€125.3 million, and deferred tax assets in the amount of €47.1 million were reported in our consolidated statement of
financial position. We determine the value of the intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting principles.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment test which must be performed at least annually or if particular circumstances or
changes in circumstances occur that indicate impairment. Within the context of carrying out the annual impairment tests in
accordance with IFRS 3/IAS 36, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units where synergies are to be expected. A
comparison of the fair values attributed to the units with their carrying values including goodwill has so far not resulted in
the need for impairments. Due to the significance that general economic factors have in the context of assessing the value
of goodwill, a continued global downturn and a potential rise in interest rates worldwide could potentially necessitate an
impairment of goodwill. These non-cash impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in future
periods, and could also significantly impact certain financial ratios.

In addition, deferred tax assets for tax loss carry forwards are only recognized if it is probable that taxable income
will be available for the loss carry forwards to be utilized. Deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of management
estimates on the expected timing and amount of income to be taxed and the future tax planning strategies. Therefore, an
impairment loss may have to be recognized if the expectations on which the amount of deferred taxes are based are not
fulfilled. An impairment loss with respect to goodwill or deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Any failures or disruptions of our information technology could affect our operations and our ability to serve customers._**

We rely on information technology for our day-to-day operations. These systems and processes include, but are
not limited to, ordering materials from suppliers, managing inventories and stock, processing transactions, summarizing
and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to
manage the business. Any interruptions, failures, manipulation or damage to these information technology systems could
lead to delays or interruptions in our business processes. A range of factors beyond our control, such as telecommunication
problems, software errors, inadequate capacity at IT centers, fire, power outages, attacks by third parties, computer viruses
and the delayed or failed implementation of new computer systems, could interfere with the availability of our IT systems.
While we have not to date experienced any material debilitating IT disruptions or cyber-attacks, data leakage or system or
production losses in recent years, there remains a risk of cyber incursions or improper use of privileged access rights

granted to administrators. This risk could be particularly damaging if any such cyber-attack or data leakage were to lead to
a failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal or other sensitive data. See also “—Legal, Taxation and Environmental
_Risks—We handle personal data in the ordinary course of our business, and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of_
_that data could result in legal liability for us and reputational harm to our business.” We do not have any cyber-security_
or other data security insurance in place, nor do we insist on any of our business partners taking out such insurance. Any
material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information to be lost. Our existing safety systems, data
backup, access protection, user management and IT emergency planning may not be sufficient to prevent information loss
or disruptions to our IT systems. In addition, if changes in technology cause our IT systems to become obsolete, or if our
IT systems are inadequate to handle our growth, our reputation may be damaged.

In addition, from time to time, we may be required to make investments to maintain and/or upgrade our IT systems
and networks and such investments may be significant, take longer or be more costly than expected or cause interruptions
to our existing systems. For example, we are currently in the process of moving to SAP S/4 HANA, an enterprise resource
planning software used to manage various business functions, which could cause issues including, but not limited to, delays,
cost overruns or system interruptions.

Any failure to properly guard against the failure, interruption or malfunctioning of our IT systems or to maintain
our IT systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our compliance and risk management systems may not be sufficient to adequately prevent or detect legal, financial or_**
**_operational risks._**

Our business is subject to various laws and regulations relating to, among other things, prevention of illegal
employment, bribery, corruption and money laundering, as well as compliance with antitrust, data protection, consumer
protection and minimum wage regulations. We are reliant on the compliance of our employees with applicable laws and
compliance policies that we have implemented. Existing risk management and internal compliance procedures and controls
may not be sufficient to prevent or detect inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law by us, our employees or third
parties acting on our behalf.

Employees may commit criminal, unlawful or unethical acts (including corruption) or our compliance and risk
management and our monitoring capabilities may prove insufficient to prevent or detect any breaches of law. Any such
acts or breaches of law could cause significant civil penalties and damage claims, as well as considerable damage to our
reputation in the market, thereby negatively affecting future business opportunities and could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on the experience and talent of our senior management and our ability to recruit and retain key employees for_**
**_the success of our business._**

Our success depends on the performance of dedicated and qualified employees, executive staff, the management
of our product groups and the experience and talent of our senior management. We may not succeed in retaining such
management, staff and employees in key positions or in recruiting and/or training a sufficient number of new employees
with necessary qualifications and skills. If we are unable to retain or recruit a sufficient number of management, staff and
skilled employees, in particular those with technical training in the areas of heat transfer, fluid dynamics and the endindustries we serve, this could impair our ability to maintain our competitiveness and market positions as well as our ability
to achieve future growth. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations
and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We have significant pension liabilities with respect to post-retirement benefits._**

We maintain a number of defined benefit pension plans, primarily for employees in Germany. In addition, we
have a number of historical pension plans (generally closed to new employees) that provide for the payment of retirement
benefits and certain disability and survivor benefits. After meeting certain qualifications, an employee’s right to future
benefits vests. In most cases, the future benefits payable are determined on the basis of the employee’s length of service,
earnings and position. New employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions.
As part of the general benefits provided all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their compensation.
Under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of up to 100 % of the deferred
amount is converted into a pension benefit. See “Business—Employees—Pension Liabilities”.

As of December 31, 2023, the present value of our defined benefit obligations under such plans amounted to
€25.4 million. Changes in interest rates expose us to additional risk (non-cash) with respect to our defined benefit
obligations, and the low interest rate environment in recent years has increased this risk due to the relatively long period
of the obligations. Current pension payments are financed through our cash flows and, in respect of certain countries, from
a reinsurance policy. These liabilities are structurally senior to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

34

**_Currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations may have a significant impact or our reported revenue, cash flows and_**
**_earnings._**

We operate globally and therefore enter into a number of customer, supplier and other contracts denominated in
different currencies. In particular, as a result of our international operations, we have significant assets and liabilities outside
the Eurozone, particularly in China, the United States, South Africa, Brazil, India, Poland, Czech Republic as well as Great
Britain. These assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollar, British pound or other local currencies. When the net
asset values are converted into euro, the currency fluctuations result in period to period changes in those net asset values.
Our equity position reflects these changes in net asset values. We hedge foreign currency items as they arise in order to fix
prices on the basis of hedging rates, and limit some currency risk, mainly from sales and procurement transactions. However,
hedging may not eliminate all risk. Despite hedging arrangements, changes in exchange rates may affect the translation into
euro of revenues, costs, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries that use a currency other than the euro as their functional currency.
A depreciation of other currencies against the euro will mean that, despite constant sales volumes and nominally constant
prices, we will, after translation into euro, generate lower revenue and profits for purposes of our consolidated financial
statements. A number of our subsidiaries report their results in currencies other than the euro, which requires us to convert the
relevant items into euro when preparing our consolidated financial statements. Any increase (or decrease) in the value of the
euro against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to
experience foreign currency translation losses (or gains, as the case may be) with respect to amounts already invested in such
foreign currencies. These currency risks, or any losses resulting from related hedging transactions, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes
and the Guarantees.

**_The assumptions made in preparing the business outlook included in the Offering Memorandum may prove incomplete or_**
**_inaccurate._**

The business outlook included in this Offering Memorandum reflects a significant number of assumptions,
projections and estimates made by the Issuer’s management. These assumptions relate to commercial expectations and
other external factors, including, but not limited to, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions and applicable
legislation, regulations or rules, all of which are difficult to predict and are beyond the Issuer’s control. Accordingly, the
assumptions made in preparing the business outlook could prove incomplete or inaccurate and there may be differences
between the Issuer’s actual and projected results. Any such differences could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks**

**_We are subject to various strict and evolving governmental regulations, laws and standards including environmental,_**
**_health and safety protection._**

Our operations and properties, as well as our products, are subject to extensive international, national, provincial
and local laws, regulations and standards relating to environmental, (occupational) health and safety protection. These
laws, regulations and standards govern, among other things: air emissions of air pollutants, waste management and disposal,
noise emissions, product safety, occupational health and safety, production, handling, treatment, storage, carriage or
transportation, supply and disposal of materials, in whichever form or aggregate state, including, for example, chemicals,
products and waste, and the remediation of contaminated land, (ground)water and buildings. The scope of these laws,
regulations and standards varies across the different countries in which we operate. For example, our operations in
European countries must comply with the national laws of the individual countries as well as directly applicable EU and
international regulations. Our operations and products are subject to a variety of environmental, (occupational) health and
safety-related requirements, including permit requirements derived therefrom. Failure to comply with these product- or
operations-related requirements with respect to both existing and future business operations, including any failure to obtain
and maintain required permits, or failure to comply with requirements imposed by obtained permits and/or additionally
applicable laws and regulations, could expose us to administrative, civil or even criminal sanctions and liabilities, including
fines and penalties, operational impacts or constraints or even mandatory shutdowns ordered by competent regulatory
authorities. With regard to products, in addition to the risk of incurring administrative, civil or even criminal sanctions and
liabilities, any non-compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could also result in products becoming
unmarketable or subject to marketing restrictions.

Our operations, in particular our production activities, subject us to various statutory and regulatory compliance
and litigation risks under (occupational) health, safety, and employment laws. There can be no assurance that there will be
no accidents, even fatal accidents, or incidents suffered by our employees, contractors or other third parties on our sites or
in the context of our business operations. If any accidents or incidents occur, we could be subject to administrative, civil
or even criminal liability and litigation, which could result in us incurring fines, penalties, other sanctions or (temporary)
operational impediments, including extensive regulatory supervision and operational or marketing limitations. The
realization of any of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

35


-----

We also operate in countries where environmental, (occupational) health and safety laws, regulations and
standards and their enforcement are still developing. As environmental, health and safety laws and enforcement in both
developing and developed countries are increasingly becoming more stringent, we expect our costs in connection with our
compliance with these laws to increase in the future. Furthermore, our interpretation of applicable current and future
environmental and (occupational) health and safety laws, regulations and standards may prove to be incorrect, and the
relevant authorities’ interpretations or enforcement of such laws and regulations may change. As a consequence, we may
also be exposed to financial penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects. In addition, changes in such laws, regulations and standards could require us to make
additional investments to maintain compliance, and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines and other
remedial measures.

Furthermore, we require various licenses, permits and other authorizations typical for manufacturers and operators
of production facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These licenses, permits and other authorizations are
generally subject to a variety of conditions that are stipulated either within the licenses, permits and other authorizations
themselves, or under the applicable laws, regulations and standards governing the issuing authorities. The continuation of
these licenses, permits and other authorizations may be subject to annual examinations or random inspections by the
relevant authorities to ensure that our premises and operations comply with all relevant regulations. Failure to comply with
these and other licenses, permits and other authorizations themselves or with applicable laws, regulations and standards,
or failure to comply with requirements to maintain or obtain such licenses, permits and other authorizations and failure to
comply with regulatory changes or changes in the law may result in existing or future licenses and authorizations being
withdrawn or not granted in the future. Moreover, any breach or material non-compliance with such licenses, permits and
authorizations or applicable laws, regulations or standards would negatively affect our operations and result in
administrative, civil or even criminal liabilities, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business._**

Greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional,
state, and local attention. Greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations have been promulgated in certain of the
jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional greenhouse gas requirements are in various stages of development.
Implementing such laws and regulations can be complex and may result in additional material costs for us.

In the EU, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism for trading
in carbon dioxide emission allowances. For example, the EU Emission Trading System (the “EU ETS”) imposes an EUwide emissions cap applying to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by in-scope operations
and provides for the trade, with allowances for such emissions for certain sectors and companies. As a result of the EU
ETS, we are and may in the future be further affected by increasing costs related to greenhouse gas emissions. The EU
ETS was comprehensively revised in 2023 and the corresponding legal acts came into force in May and June 2023. The
revisions include a plan to annually reduce the EU-wide emissions cap, with a linear reduction factor increasing from 2.2%
(2021-2023) to 4.3% (2024-2027) and 4.4% (2028-2030). The revisions provide for the previous carbon leakage protection
measures, in particular free allocation, to be gradually phased out and introduces the so-called Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism aims to address risks of carbon leakage by subjecting imported
and domestic products to equivalent carbon pricing. Generally, EU manufacturers will need to buy allowances for their
emissions and importers from outside the EU will likewise need to buy carbon certificates, corresponding to the carbon
price that they would have paid if they had manufactured the products in the EU. Under the currently applicable EU ETS,
the EU-wide emissions cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 2.2% of the average annual total quantity of emission
allowances issued in the EU between 2021 and 2023. This linear factor will be raised to 4.3% from 2024 to 2027 and to
4.4% from 2028 to 2030. The revision also includes a one-off reduction of the EU-wide quantity of emissions allowances
by 90 million in 2024 and by 27 million in 2026. According to this reduction path, the total quantity of newly issued
allowances will be zero in 2040. Until then, the transitional free allocation allowances will continue on a reduced scale. On
June 5, 2023, the 2023 Directive (EU) 2023/959 amending the Emissions Trading Directive 2003/87/EC (the “Emissions
**Trading Directive”) entered into force. According to the amended version of the Emissions Trading Directive, the free**
allocation will be reduced to 0% until 2030, except for district heating, which will continue to receive a free allocation of
30%. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission allowances will have to purchase a significant,
and steadily increasing, share of increasingly pricy emission allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial
additional costs for such companies. An exemption is available for certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed
to a significant risk of relocation of plants to countries with less stringent climate protection laws (a phenomenon known
as “Carbon Leakage”). These industries are determined by the European Commission every five years. The designated
industries will be allocated emission allowances free of charge for the period until 2023 at 100% of a pre-determined
quantity. It cannot be determined with certainty whether the exemption applies to us. In this respect, enormous costs could
be incurred for the purchase of emission certificates.

Further, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would establish a nationwide limit on
greenhouse gases. In addition, the US Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has issued regulations limiting

36


-----

greenhouse gas emissions from mobile and stationary sources pursuant to the US Clean Air Act. The Carbon Pollution
Standards for New, Modified and Reconstructed Power Plants apply to brand new sources built in the future or to an
existing unit that meets certain, specific conditions. They reflect the degree of emission limitations achievable through the
application of the best system of emission reduction for which the EPA has determined that emission reduction has been
adequately demonstrated for each type of unit. While we are currently not subject to such CO2 emissions regulations, our
plant in Muskegon, Michigan, United States is considered a so-called stationary source under the US Clean Air Act. In
case of changes to current legislation, we could in the future be subject to limitations in this regard.

When effective, such measures could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement
additional or more restrictive emission control technology, curtail operations, or increase our operating costs. Thus, any
additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including through a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate,
emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. In addition, this could also have an impact on our suppliers or vertical markets (particularly Oil & Gas).

**_We may not be able to obtain certain certifications required for certain areas of our business, in particular the power_**
**_industry, in a timely manner, and this may delay our order intake with respect to such projects._**

In order to access projects in certain industries, such as the nuclear and oil and gas industries, applicable
regulations and some customers require that we undergo a certification process regarding our internal processes as
providers and the characteristics and quality of our products. These certification processes are complex, time-consuming
and lengthy, and may depend on factors that are, in part, beyond our control, such as obtaining approvals from regulatory
authorities and independent third-party audits. For example, certification processes regarding certain products that we
supply to customers in the oil and gas industry can be particularly complex and lengthy. A delay or a denial in any of such
certification processes would prevent us from winning orders until the required certifications have been granted and we
may therefore not yet be able to profit from valuable business opportunities. This could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_Compliance with chemical regulations applicable to both our products and raw materials could adversely affect our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In our production activities, we use hazardous chemicals that are subject to regulation by the EU and other national,
provincial and local laws, regulations and standards as well as enforcement by governmental authorities in the countries in
which we operate. In order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products and production processes, we may be
required to demonstrate to the relevant authorities that the product is safe for its intended uses and that production is safe
and will still be applied in accordance with the applicable regulations. The process of seeking approvals can be timeconsuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. Approvals may not be granted to us on a timely basis, or at
all. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure to obtain or maintain, these authorizations or approvals would adversely affect
our ability to conduct certain production-related activities, to introduce new products, to continue distributing and
marketing existing products and to generate revenue from those products, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our products (and the raw materials used to produce them) are subject to extensive environmental and
industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analyses of the substances they contain. We must
comply with a broad range of regulations relating to the authorization, testing, manufacturing and labelling of our products
and those of our suppliers. In some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, these types of
regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue.

Further, Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction
of Chemicals (“REACH”) stipulates general rules for the marketing of substances, mixtures and articles in the European
economic area, and imposes various obligations which vary according to the hazardous properties of the substances, their
form, quantity and concentration, as well as the role of the actors in the supply chain. Applicable obligations include,
among others, a duty to register substances, notify of substances in articles, communicate information in the supply chain
and down to the customers, comply with restrictions and/or authorization requirements. REACH also imposes substantial
obligations with regard to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of building block and semi-specialty
chemicals. Pursuant thereto, we are required to demonstrate that the risks to human health or the environment associated
with our use of relevant substances are adequately controlled by carrying out periodic testing of their toxicological level.
These testing procedures can be costly and time-intensive and may lead to an increase in production or purchasing costs.

All substances currently required for our business are registered in accordance with REACH. However, regulatory
review of the registrations may result in a need to update registrations. Furthermore, the registration of additional substances
contained in new products manufactured or imported by us may become necessary. This, as well as maintaining ongoing
broader compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements (not merely registration requirements), may give rise to
further costs and, under certain circumstances, even operational impacts. Respective compliance also pertains to Regulation

37


-----

(EC) No 1272/2008 on Classification, Labelling and Packaging, as amended from time to time (the “CLP Regulation”),
which sets out hazard classes and criteria for the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures and
imposes related classification, labelling and packaging requirements on, in particular, manufacturers, importers and
suppliers. Both REACH and the CLP are amended from time to time, in particular in relation to new substances being
identified as substances of very high concern, being subjected to new authorization, restriction or information
communication requirements or substances, including raw materials, chemicals or substances contained in products, being
(re-)classified under the CLP. Compliance with amended laws and regulations subjects our operations to new or altered
regulatory requirements and may further impact our operations and give rise to significant costs and other impacts, such as
substances not being available on time for production and products not being marketable.

The EU is considering a ban or the introduction of thresholds on so-called “forever chemicals” – per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), a large class of thousands of synthetic perpetual chemicals that are used throughout
society but increasingly deemed to be environmental pollutants, with some being associated with negative effects on human
health, are not directly used in our products. The EU-wide regulation is expected to come into force in 2026. We are
therefore exposed to the risk that materials currently used by us in the production of most of our gasketed plate heat
exchangers, which contain PFAS, may become more expensive or, potentially, may no longer be readily available in the
future. We are working closely with our key gasket suppliers and monitoring the situation, particularly with the aim of
using alternative and recently developed compounds with PFAS levels that will be below the acceptable thresholds of the
future regulation. While we expect the alternative materials, which are currently in the validation process, to be similar in
cost to those materials currently in use, there is no assurance that the alternative materials will be more cost-effective or,
conversely, that they will exceed the current costs.

Any of the foregoing outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations could have an_**
**_adverse impact on us._**

We are active in numerous countries worldwide. We have a global production footprint, with production sites in
more than 20 countries around the world. Therefore, we are subject to various laws and regulations in the different
jurisdictions in which we are active. Due to the industry in which we operate, these laws and regulations impose
comprehensive compliance obligations on us and restrict our offering and operating activities. These obligations and
restrictions, in turn, can be difficult to administer because of their scope, dynamic nature and varied requirements and, as
such, our global operations expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, such laws and regulations. In
addition, rapidly changing export control rules and regulations have in the past resulted in us, and may in the future lead to
a risk of inadvertently violating specific countries’ export control regulations and laws. Our failure or alleged failure to
comply with these laws and regulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as significant financial penalties and/or
operational implications.

Should we be in violation of existing laws and regulation or fail to comply with changing laws and regulations,
this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

**_Our products, services and know-how may not be fully protected by intellectual property rights, our intellectual property_**
**_rights may be infringed or challenged by third parties and we may infringe third parties’ intellectual property rights or_**
**_be faced with claims regarding infringement with regard to the use of intellectual property._**

We own a number of patents and other intellectual property that are of significant importance to our business.
The granting of patents does not necessarily imply that they are effective or that potential patent claims can be enforced
to the degree required or desired. Additionally, the patents we have applied for or intend to file for registration in
connection with new technological developments may not be granted in each of the countries where we consider this
necessary or desirable. Third parties may infringe our patents and/or intellectual property rights and we may, for legal or
factual reasons, be unable to halt such infringements. With respect to certain product areas, continuous further
development of products and maintaining technical leadership is necessary to prevent competitors from copying our
products.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to profit from the advances in
technology we have achieved, which could lead to a reduction in future results of operations. This could affect our
competitive position and any resulting reduction in revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we may infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, given that our
competitors also have pending applications for patent protection. With regard to patent rights, if we have not validly
claimed such inventions, employees may assert claims against us in relation to the ownership rights of the invention or
remuneration. This may result in the prohibition of our ability to use the affected technologies or the need to purchase
licenses, alter manufacturing processes or pay compensation. Know-how and industrial secrets that are not patented or

38


-----

cannot be patented are also of significant importance in our business, in particular in areas with technologically
demanding products and production processes. For example, there is a risk that our competitors may have been granted
patents for products and production processes that, at the time in question, we had already produced or implemented
without a patent. In the relevant country, this could lead to restrictions regarding the sale of the affected products, the
application of the relevant production processes or to an obligation to pay license fees. We may not be able to protect
our industrial secrets and third parties may develop the same or similar know-how independently.

Any restrictions on delivery and production due to patent infringement, or production interruptions resulting from
patent infringement, whether due to a change in a manufacturing process or due to other reasons, or the subsequent
acquisition of corresponding licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We handle personal data in the ordinary course of our business, and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of that_**
**_data could result in legal liability for us and reputational harm to our business._**

From time to time, we process personal data (including, in certain instances, names and addresses) as part of our
business, and therefore we are subject to and must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws across several
jurisdictions. Moreover, data protection laws and rules impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our
ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers and could make us liable in
the event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party access. Unauthorized data disclosure
could occur through cyber-security breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or
accidental user activity, internal security breaches, and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining
physical access.

We, our distributors, suppliers and other business partners may be the subject of breaches of security by hackers.
A future breach of our system or that of one of our distributors, suppliers or other business partners may subject us to
material losses or liability, including fines, claims for unauthorized use of personal and sensitive data or other claims.
Inadequate technology or security measures, the failure to follow proper security protocols or other factors may result in
data loss or unauthorized disclosure or a compromise or breach of our systems and the data we receive, store and process.
Security measures may be breached or data may be lost or disclosed by third parties (for example, through social
engineering techniques to induce disclosure of passwords or other sensitive information, other actions to gain access to our
data or our customers’ or partners’ data, or the use of ineffective security measures or failure to follow proper security
protocols), human error (such as the use of weak passwords or unencrypted devices), malfeasance or vulnerabilities
(including vulnerabilities in third-party products upon which we rely). A misuse of such data or a cyber-security breach
could harm our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to
uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, or result in the imposition of material
penalties and fines under any applicable international laws or regulations.

For example, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations on privacy, information security and data protection,
the main and most relevant of which relate to the collection, protection and use of personal and business data, including
the EU Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”), the German Federal Data Protection Act
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, the “BDSG”), the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection
Regulation, (together, the “UK GDPR”). See “Regulation—Data Privacy.” The costs of complying with the GDPR are
increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place.
For example, the GDPR and the UK GDPR impose substantial fines and other administrative sanctions for violations of
the data protection rules. The imposition of these sanctions will depend on the nature of the infringed provision and the
concomitant circumstances, and may include formal warnings, cease-and-desist orders and fines of up to €20 million (or
£17.5 million) or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the undertaking in the preceding financial year,
whichever is higher, for each infraction. Additional penalties may apply, such as an immediate prohibition of the data
processing activity. Further adverse consequences of an infringement of the GDPR may include civil claims for material
and immaterial damages from the affected individuals. Implementing legislation of individual Member States, such as the
BDSG, also provides for criminal sanctions for specific violations, which may also entail the loss of any profits realized as
a result of infringements of the GDPR. Finally, in addition to these regulatory risks, any infringement of such legislation
could lead to reputational risk and significantly undermine customers’ trust in our business. See “—Our business may suffer
_if our reputation is damaged.” In addition, if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries_
and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our products, the geographical location
or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operation.

In the United States, risks of actual or perceived non-compliance includes enforcement actions under federal and
state laws, rules and regulations. In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have approved, and may propose and
approve in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must comply or that contractually apply to us. US state laws
in this area are complex and developing rapidly and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Many state legislatures
have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate, including measures relating to privacy, data security and

39


-----

data breaches. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to
another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As we seek to expand our business, we are, and may increasingly
become, subject to various laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security in
the jurisdictions in which we operate. Despite our efforts, our practices may not comply, now or in the future, with all such
laws, regulations, requirements, and obligations and this could, among other things, result in the following: claims,
proceedings, or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities; the incurrence of significant
defense-related expenses or the imposition of monetary penalties; an increase in our costs of doing business; a loss of
customers or manufacturers; an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, and business; the requirement to change our
operations and/or to cease using certain data sets; or an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We
may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of noncompliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy or security or any inadvertent or
unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.

In China, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding cyber-security and data protection. For
example, under China’s Cybersecurity Law, any collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information of a Chinese
citizen through a network by the network operator should be based on the three principles of legitimacy, justification and
necessity and requires the consent of the data subject and the disclosure to the latter of the rules, purposes, methods and
ranges of such collection. The Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”) further clarifies the scope of application,
the definitions of personal information and sensitive personal information, the legality of personal information processing
and the basic requirements of notice and consent, among other things. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to RMB
50 million or 5% of the prior year’s total annual revenue for the personal information processor and/or a suspension of
services or data processing activities. Other potential penalties include the imposition of a fine of up to RMB 1 million on
the person in charge or directly responsible personnel and, in serious cases, criminal liability under other local Chinese
law. The PIPL also prohibits responsible personnel for violations of the PIPL from holding high level management or data
protection officer positions in relevant enterprises. China’s data localization requirements are becoming increasingly
common in sector-specific regulations. We cannot predict what impact the new laws and regulations, in particular the Data
Security Law or PIPL, or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in China due to their recent
enactment and the limited guidance available, particularly on PIPL. It is also generally unclear how the laws, which are
often broadly drafted and leave considerable discretion to the relevant government authorities, will be interpreted and
enforced in practice by those authorities.

**_Labor disputes could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**

We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which may disrupt our operations. Labor laws applicable to our business
activities in certain countries are relatively rigorous and provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In
addition, many of our employees are members of unions or represented by works councils, employee representatives or
other bodies. For example, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements in various countries, including Germany,
France, Spain and the Netherlands. Pursuant to such agreements, we are often required to inform, consult with and request
the consent or opinion of union representatives or works councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects
of our business. These employee protections and rights may consequently require us to spend greater time and expense in
altering or amending employees’ terms of employment or making headcount reductions. These labor laws and consultative
procedures could also limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit
our ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important
strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which
could lead to labor actions that disrupt our business.

Although we believe our relations with employees are good, our operations may nevertheless be materially
affected by strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the future, including
disagreements with works councils or other employee co-determination bodies. We are involved in negotiations with regard
to collective bargaining agreements, some of which may be approaching expiration or renewal (for example, in Germany),
on an ongoing basis in the ordinary course of our business. This is a process which ultimately results in higher costs for us,
whether in the form of wage increases or in terms of the repercussions for our operations of strikes by our workforce.
Additionally, in the event of non-compliance with certain welfare obligations stipulated in the collective bargaining
agreements applicable in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France and Spain, it is possible that the collective
wage currently in place pursuant to our “in-house” or company-specific collective bargaining agreements could return to
the wage levels pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements for the chemicals industry. These and other similar laborrelated incidents or matters could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We are exposed to product liability claims and the risk that our products may not fulfill customer requirements or_**
**_specifications._**

Our products play an important role in regulating the operation of industrial processes. We could be subject to
claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged failure of our products that may result in a failure of an industrial process,

40


-----

and such failure may cause significant financial losses, injury or death, which could negatively affect our business. For
example, in 2019, an explosion and fire occurred at the site of one of our end-customers and is claimed to have a link to
certain products delivered by us. Following the incident, the insurer of our end-customer asserted that our product was
responsible for the explosion and fire and therefore liable for damages. While we rejected these assertions and are not party
to any legal proceedings in relation to the incident of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we may still be exposed to
material liability in the future. Awards of damages, settlement amounts and fees and expenses resulting from this or other
claims and the public relations implications of any such claims, could have an adverse effect on our business.

We also cooperate with manufacturers and other suppliers which provide us with the materials and intermediate
products used in our operations. As we do not have direct control over the quality of the materials and intermediate products
manufactured or supplied by such third parties, we are exposed to a risk related to the quality of such materials and
intermediate products. We may use materials and intermediate products in our operations that are subsequently suspected
to contain defects of quality or to have been the cause of damage to persons or property.

Any of these types of allegations may subject us to reputational damage or may form the basis for claims that
clients and other third parties assert against us. This may require us to expend additional resources to take appropriate
corrective action with regard to affected products or systems, in addition to potential costs for penalties. We have in the
past faced performance issues with respect to our products and projects, including issues relating to vibrations, icing and
insufficient performance of products or components. Claims asserted against us can be expensive to defend and can divert
the attention of personnel for significant time periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The availability and cost of
insurance to cover claims for damages caused by us or our products are subject to market forces that we do not control, and
such insurance would not cover damages to our reputation. A lost product or performance liability claim could have a
material adverse effect on our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending
against claims relating to the products sold or services performed by us, the mere assertion of such claims could have a
negative impact on client confidence in our services and products. In addition, even if a liability claim is not brought before
court, it may lead to additional costs, for instance for product or component replacements, performance tests extension,
correction of defects and additional engineering. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our systems and products are covered by warranties, and we provide performance guarantees relating to our project_**
**_business. Unanticipated warranty costs for defective systems and products and drawings under the performance_**
**_guarantees granted in connection with our projects could adversely affect our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations, as well as our reputation._**

We offer to our customers primarily bank or corporate performance guarantees to facilitate projects during the
ordinary course of business (trade-related guarantees), including performance guarantees covering potential fulfillment
problems in the context of our projects, as well as warranty guarantees after the delivery of our products and systems and
during the warranty period. We offer warranty periods of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific
system or product and terms of the customer agreement. Existing and future warranty obligations place us at risk of
incurring future repair and/or replacement costs. Orders typically provide for warranty obligations that remain in force for
several years, thereby exposing us to future, unforeseen costs which could be material. We have received warranty claims
in the past. In this respect, we are also subject to the risk that customers call on a guarantee without a valid technical or
performance issue. An unanticipated or invalid claim could materially increase our warranty costs. The need to repair or
replace systems and products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new systems and
products, reduce our profits, cause us to suffer a loss and could adversely affect our reputation. Substantial or extraordinary
amounts of warranty claims or drawings on the performance guarantees granted by us could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We are subject to risks relating to litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business._**

We are subject to the risk of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. From time to
time, we have been and are party, as defendant or plaintiff, to various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course
of our business, such as those related to employment, tax and corporate matters. For example, we have in the past been
party to various legal proceedings in different jurisdictions in connection with the financial restructuring and
recapitalization of Galapagos Holding S.A. and Galapagos S.A. in 2019, all of which have now either been dismissed or
decided in our favor. In particular, certain holders of senior unsecured notes issued by Galapagos Holdings S.A. in 2014
(the “2014 Senior Unsecured Notes”), which had been impaired as part of the financial restructuring and recapitalization
as well the German insolvency administrator of Galapagos S.A., filed claims against Galapagos Holdings S.A., Galapagos
BidCo S.à r.l. and certain Group entities in the courts of the State of New York, Germany and Luxembourg asserting,
among others, that the financial restructuring and recapitalization violated the terms of the documents governing the 2014
Unsecured Notes and constituted a voidable transaction. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

41


-----

Additionally, our use of more innovative processes and the installation of any newly developed products could by
their nature entail a greater risk of failure and could lead to increased risk of liability claims under product warranties or
product liability laws. The results of pending or future legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, and we can
provide no assurance that we will not incur losses in connection with current or future litigation or other legal proceedings
or actions that exceed any provision we may set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or that exceed any insurance
coverage available. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage could prove to be inadequate._**

We maintain insurance policies relating to certain operating risks, including property damage (including certain
aspects of business interruption for our sites), product liability, cargo in transit insurance, credit insurance for certain of
our entities, vehicle insurance (in certain locations), travel and security, environmental insurance, health insurance and
employer and liability insurance for certain of our entities, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. While we believe
that the types and amounts of insurance coverage we currently maintain are generally in line with customary practice in
our industry and are adequate for our business operations, our insurance does not cover all potential risks associated with
our business or for which we may otherwise be liable, and the scope of coverage of our existing policies and policy limits
may ultimately prove to be insufficient to adequately cover all aspects of certain risks, hazards or liabilities for which we
seek to make a claim. For example, our insurance policies may not cover, or fully cover, us against political risks, global
conflicts, public health crises, cyber-security risks, natural catastrophes, weather and other climate-related risks or the
inherent hazards of our operations. Our Russian subsidiary can no longer be insured under our Group international
insurance programs and, therefore, no longer benefit from the financial interest coverage thereunder. As a result, the
Russian subsidiary has taken out local stand-alone insurance policies on standard market terms in Russia. In addition, our
policies are subject to standard deductibles and exclusions that could affect our ability to make a claim. Consequently, we
cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us from all risks that may arise or in
amounts sufficient to compensate any material loss. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to
any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. We
may also not be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost in the future. If a loss or claim
is not sufficiently covered by insurance coverage or we are unable to maintain our current insurance coverage, this could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Pending and future tax audits and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional tax liabilities._**

We are subject to routine tax audits by local tax authorities in the countries in which we operate. For example, the
German tax authorities are currently conducting a general tax audit of corporate income tax, trade tax and VAT for the
years 2017 to 2020. While we believe that we have paid all material tax liabilities and filed all material tax returns as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, and made provisions that we believe to be adequate with respect to material tax
risks resulting from current or past tax audits, there can be no assurance that tax deficiencies will not be asserted against
us or that the taxes assessed by the competent authorities pursuant to such tax audits will not exceed such provisions. All
of the tax assessments issued for periods which were not yet finally audited may be subject to review.

Future tax audits may result in additional tax and interest payments, which would negatively affect our financial
condition and results of operations. Changes in global minimum taxation rules (e.g., Pillar II), fiscal regulations (e.g., in
connection with the OECD BEPS initiative or the respective EU initiatives) or the interpretation of tax laws by the courts
or the tax authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business may also have negative consequences
and increase our tax burden and give rise to additional reporting and disclosure obligations, which could increase our costs
and have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, tax authorities may, to some extent, not accept the
deductibility of interest payments, claiming, among other aspects, that limitations under interest ceiling rules or transfer
pricing rules apply. In such event, we may face additional tax payments becoming due in tax audits or in the process of tax
assessments. Any additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Due to the forfeiture of loss carry forwards under applicable tax laws, we may be unable to use loss carry forwards to set_**
**_off future gains._**

Tax loss carry forwards and unused losses of the current financial year are forfeited in full if more than 50% of
the subscribed capital, membership rights, participation rights or voting rights in the Issuer are transferred, directly or
indirectly, to an acquirer or related party of such acquirer (or a group of acquirers with common interests) within a period
of five years or in case of comparable measures (harmful acquisition). The same applies for interest carry forwards, if any.
If and to the extent the tax loss carry forwards, interest carry forwards and unused losses of the current financial year are
covered by the built-in gains of the loss-making company’s business assets that are subject to domestic taxation, a forfeiture
of such items would generally not apply. As the application of forfeiture rules on loss carry forwards may be subject to
changes in interpretation of tax laws by courts or tax authorities, we cannot rule out that such forfeiture rules may apply to
us in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our tax position, financial condition and results of operations.

-----

**_We may not be able to meet or achieve our sustainability-related goals._**

We have established certain goals, targets and other objectives in relation to sustainability matters, including
reductions with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction, fossil fuel use reduction, renewable energy and
utilities. Our efforts to achieve these sustainability objectives expose us to various operational, reputational, financial, legal
and other risks, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our ability to achieve any of our
sustainability-related targets and objectives is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our
control. These include the availability and costs of low-carbon or carbon-free energy sources, evolving regulatory
requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures, the availability of future financing and the availability of
suppliers that can meet our sustainability standards.

Our business may face increased scrutiny in the future from our customers, the investment community,
governmental entities, regulators and other stakeholders that we serve in relation to our sustainability activities, including
the sustainability objectives that we adopt, our methodologies and timelines, as well as our ability to document and support
the achievement of those objectives. If our sustainability measures and achievements fail to meet the expectations of our
customers, investors or other stakeholders, our reputation could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived
failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability objectives within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have an
adverse impact as well as expose us to regulatory scrutiny or litigation.

**_We could be held liable for soil, surface water or groundwater contamination or for risks related to hazardous wastes,_**
**_substances and/or materials, including clean-up obligations and third-party claims._**

Certain sites where we operate have been used for industrial purposes for years, potentially having caused
environmental contamination, resulting in a risk of us incurring contamination-related obligations. Similarly, we could also
incur contamination-related liability and/or third-party claims (such as for bodily injury or property damage) related to
offsite areas impacted by our sites and operations, possibly including damage to specifically protected natural resources.
Regulatory authorities could assert claims against us as the current or former owner or tenant (operator) of affected sites
or as the party that caused or contributed to the contamination (so-called polluter), requiring, _e.g., the investigation,_
remediation, containment or orderly disposal of relevant soil or (ground)water contamination or other environmental media
(e.g., soil, air and buildings). Claims could also relate to our use of non-owned treatment, storage and disposal sites. Costs
typically incurred in connection with such claims are difficult to predict. The realization of any such risks could have a
material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual property and technical expertise._**

Our products and services are highly dependent upon our technological know-how and the scope and limitations
of our proprietary rights therein. We regularly apply for and are granted intellectual property rights with respect to our
innovations. The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive. Furthermore, patents may not be
granted on currently pending or future applications or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with
meaningful protection. In addition, while there is a presumption that patents are valid, the granting of a patent does not
necessarily imply that it is effective or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree necessary or desired.
Certain of our existing patents convey a narrow scope of protection, including in terms of geographic reach and goods and
services covered. Additionally, our patents might have lapsed or expired. Furthermore, our competitors, suppliers,
customers and other third parties also submit intellectual property protection applications. Such other parties could hold
effective and enforceable intellectual property rights to certain processes, methods or applications and, consequently, could
assert infringement claims (including illegitimate ones) against us. A portion of our know-how and industrial secrets is not
patented and cannot be protected through intellectual property rights. Consequently, there is a risk that third parties, in
particular competitors, will copy our know-how without incurring any expenses of their own. The realization of any of
these risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_There is a risk that we may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties._**

Our competitors, suppliers and customers also submit a large number of inventions for intellectual property
protection. It is not always possible to determine with certainty whether there are effective and enforceable third-party
intellectual property rights to certain processes, methods or applications. In addition, where we incorporate an individual
customer’s input to create a product that responds to a particular need, we face the risk that such customer will claim
ownership rights in the associated intellectual property. Therefore, third parties could assert infringement claims (including
illegitimate ones) against us. As a result, we could be required to cease manufacturing, using or marketing the relevant
technologies or products in certain countries or be forced to make changes to manufacturing processes or products. In
addition, we could be liable to pay compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to make use of
technology from third parties. This could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

43


-----

**_The international scope of our operations expose us to potentially adverse tax consequences._**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the
international scope of our operations. Adverse changes or developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in
position by the relevant authority regarding the application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations in
any applicable jurisdiction could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding
the tax treatment or characterization of any transactions, including the application of VAT exemptions or characterization
of our indebtedness, including the Notes, existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees, the deduction of interest
expenses or the existence of foreign permanent establishments. We may fail, whether inadvertently or due to reasons
beyond our control, to comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment of our various financing
arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. If applicable tax authorities were to
successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our intercompany loans or transactions, it could result
in the disallowance of deductions, a limitation on our ability to deduct interest expenses, the imposition of withholding
taxes, the application of significant penalties and accrued interest on intercompany loans or internal deemed transfers, the
application of penalties and accrued interest or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Structure and Financial Position**

**_The Issuer’s debt agreements will contain customary financial and restrictive covenants that limit its operating_**
**_flexibility._**

The Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement will contain covenants significantly restricting the ability
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock,

    - create or incur liens,

    - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity,

    - make certain restricted payments and certain investments or sell or transfer certain assets,

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries,

    - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to,
and on the disposal, transfer or lease of assets by subsidiaries,

    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries,

    - consolidate or merge with other entities, and

    - impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

In addition, the Super Senior Facilities Agreement will contain a financial covenant as described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Super Senior Facilities Agreement.”

Any future debt agreements that the Issuer may enter into may have covenants that are even more restrictive. The
requirement that the Issuer complies with these and any future provisions may materially adversely affect its ability to react
to changes in market conditions, to take advantage of business opportunities that the Issuer believes to be desirable, to
obtain future financing, to fund needed capital expenditures, or to withstand a continuing or future downturn in its business.

As a result of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in the instruments discussed above or under any other
outstanding debt instruments, any breach of any covenant under those instruments could result in all amounts outstanding
under any such instrument being accelerated and becoming due and payable. The Issuer may be unable to pay these debts
in such circumstances.

**_If the Issuer is unable to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants included in the Indenture and the Super_**
**_Senior Facilities Agreement or any future debt agreements, there could be a default under such agreements, which_**
**_could result in an acceleration of repayment._**

As described in the preceding risk factor, the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement will contain,
and any future debt agreements the Issuer enters into may contain, certain financial and restrictive covenants. The Issuer’s
ability to comply with these covenants, including meeting financial ratios and tests, depends on a number of factors, some

44


-----

of which may be beyond the Issuer’s control, such as a deterioration of the industry and markets in which the Issuer operates
or a deviation from the assumptions contained in the Issuer’s business plan. As a result, the Issuer may be unable to comply
with its financial and restrictive covenants, and any failure may materially adversely affect the Issuer’s results of operations
and financial condition.

The breach of a financial or other covenant or the Issuer’s failure to meet any of its obligations under any of the
agreements governing its debt may result in a default under such agreements, which in turn could result in a number of
adverse consequences, including prohibiting the Issuer from drawing additional funds under credit facilities, significant
increases in interest rates and other financing costs, the acceleration of all outstanding amounts under such agreements
requiring the Issuer to immediately repay the related debt in whole or in part, and/or the commencement of foreclosure or
other enforcement actions against any of the Issuer’s assets securing such debt. Defaults may also trigger cross-default and
cross-acceleration clauses contained in the Issuer’s other debt agreements, including the Indenture, and its liquid funds and
short-term cash flow may be insufficient to service any of the debts in the circumstances described above. Accordingly,
any failure by the Issuer to service its debts may have a materially adverse effect on its ability to satisfy our obligations,
including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The interests of the Sponsor may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Sponsor indirectly owns the majority of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, the Issuer’s shareholder has and
will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect its legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect
and change its management and to approve other changes to the Issuer’s operations and to influence the outcome of matters
requiring action by its shareholder. Its shareholder’s interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as
holder of the Notes, particularly if the Issuer encounters financial difficulties or is unable to pay its debts when due. For
example, the shareholder could vote to cause the Issuer to incur additional indebtedness. The Issuer’s shareholder is in the
business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or
indirectly with the Issuer. The Issuer’s shareholder may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to
the Issuer’s business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to the Issuer. The Issuer’s
shareholder and its affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more
divestitures of all or part of the Issuer’s business or sales of its shares which would result in changes to its shareholding
structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity
investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**_The Issuer’s substantial leverage may make it difficult for it to operate its business._**

Upon completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have significant debt service obligations. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations” and “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data.” As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the_
Transactions as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the Issuer would have had as adjusted Net Debt of €294.4 million.

The Issuer’s significant leverage could have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including:

    - making it more difficult for it to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes and its other debt and
liabilities;

    - increasing its vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal
of, and interest on, its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research & development, or other general
corporate purposes;

    - restricting the Issuer from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

    - limiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business, the competitive environment and
the industry in which the Issuer operates;

    - negatively impacting credit terms with its suppliers and other creditors;

    - exposing the Issuer to increases in interest rates with respect to its floating rate debt instruments, such as the
Super Senior Facilities;

    - placing the Issuer at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are not as highly leveraged;
and

45


-----

    - limiting its ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business
opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future
borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s results of
operations and financial condition, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its
obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

As a result of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in the instruments discussed above or under any other
outstanding debt instruments, any breach of any covenant under those instruments could result in all amounts outstanding
under any such instrument being accelerated and becoming due and payable. The Issuer may be unable to pay these debts
in such circumstances.

In addition, under the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant in the Indenture and the Super Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Issuer is permitted to make significant dividend payments and other distributions to its
shareholders, which could also increase its leverage. To the extent the Issuer becomes even more leveraged or incur
additional obligations, the risks described above will intensify.

**_The Issuer may incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could adversely affect its business, prevent it from_**
**_fulfilling its obligations with respect to the Notes and further exacerbate the risks associated with its substantial_**
**_indebtedness._**

The Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement will permit the Issuer to incur substantial additional
indebtedness, including up to €65.0 million under the Cash RCF Facility and up to €190.0 million under the L/G RCF
Facility or other letter of credit facilities and, in addition, certain other debt, which may be secured and that shares in the
Collateral securing the Notes. Certain creditors with respect to its debt, including lenders under the Super Senior Facilities
Agreement as well as other letter of credit facilities and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and cash management
obligations, will receive proceeds from the enforcement of security granted over the Collateral or certain distressed
disposals prior to the holders of the Notes. The Indenture will permit the Issuer to incur certain additional debt that may be
secured on property and assets that do not secure the Notes, which debt as a result will be effectively senior to the Notes to
the extent of the value of such property and assets. In addition, the Indenture will allow the Issuer’s non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt that would be structurally senior to the Notes and will not prevent the Issuer
from incurring liabilities that do not constitute “Indebtedness” as defined thereunder. The agreements governing the
Issuer’s debt generally limit its ability to incur additional indebtedness, but do not prohibit it from doing so. Borrowings
under debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions may as a result also be accelerated and
become due and payable. The Issuer may be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances. The incurrence of additional
indebtedness would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_The Notes and borrowings under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at floating rates that could_**
**_rise significantly, increasing the Issuer’s interest cost and debt and reducing its cash flow._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, substantially all of our debt will bear interest at a variable rate and our
exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates will increase. In particular, the Notes and borrowings under the Super
Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at a variable rate, which could rise significantly in the future. The material
increases in global inflation since early 2022, reaching double-digit levels not seen since the 1980s, and expectations that
annual inflation may remain high for a long period of time (driven at least in part by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the
resulting impact on energy markets) has forced central banks of the major world economies, including the US Federal
Reserve and the European Central Bank, to significantly increase market interest rates in a very short timeframe. The
interest rates under our floating rate financing arrangements, including under the Notes, could continue to rise significantly
in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital
expenditure, and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Indenture nor the Super Senior Facilities
Agreement will contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although the Issuer may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging
itself carries certain risks, including that the Issuer may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any
hedging arrangements. If interest rates rise in the future, the Issuer’s interest expense associated with any variable rate
obligations that are not hedged would increase, even though the amounts borrowed would remain the same, reducing cash
flow available to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general
corporate purposes, including satisfying the Issuer’s debt service obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_EURIBOR or other benchmarks may be discontinued or change in the future._**

46


-----

Various interest rate benchmarks (including historic EURIBOR) have been the subject of recent national and
international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU
Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented.

EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical
benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms and other
pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as
a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or
participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, you
should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate
benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including
to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an
adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of
their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Indenture and the Super Senior
Facilities Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have
not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be
determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations,
although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may
not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time).
In addition, the development of future alternatives to EURIBOR may result in the Notes performing differently than would
otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR had not developed.

The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if (i) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR, (ii)
EURIBOR is not available, (iii) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR, (iv) an alternative rate has
replaced EURIBOR or (v) it becomes unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third-party agent to use EURIBOR,
the Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate successor rate, which
means that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was
not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Interest.”
The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments
(including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent
of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to
the interests of the holders of the Notes.

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement
of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant
time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could
require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material
adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise
unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions
applicable to such debt.

**_The Issuer requires a significant amount of cash to service its debt, and its ability to generate sufficient cash depends_**
**_on factors that may be beyond our control._**

The Issuer’s ability to service and refinance its debt and to fund future operations and capital expenditures is
highly dependent on our future operating performance and the Issuer’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow. To a
significant degree, the Issuer’s future operating performance and ability to generate cash flows is, in turn, dependent on
various general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are outside the
Issuer’s control. Due to any of these factors, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from
their operating activities, anticipated sales growth, cost saving or operational efficiency improvements, and any future debt
or equity financing may not be available to the Issuer in amounts, which would enable the Issuer to pay the principal
premium and interest of its indebtedness, including the Notes.

To the extent that the Issuer’s cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to meet its liquidity needs and
service its debt, the Issuer would have to seek additional debt or equity financing. If the Issuer’s future cash flows from
operating activities and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our various obligations as they mature or to fund our
ongoing liquidity needs, the Issuer and its subsidiaries may be forced, among other things, to reduce or delay business
activities and capital expenditures, sell assets or forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses. There can
be no assurance that any of these alternatives can be accomplished on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.
Further, the Issuer may be compelled to restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt, including the Notes, on or before
their maturity. The Issuer may face the additional risk that in order to refinance its debt, the Issuer could be required to
agree to more onerous covenants, which would further restrict its business operations. The occurrence of any event
described above may have a materially adverse effect on the Issuer’s margins and results of operations and financial
condition.

47


-----

**_The Issuer may be unable to extend or refinance our debt on favorable terms or at all._**

Amounts outstanding under the Super Senior Facilities and other future borrowings must potentially be repaid
before the maturity date of the Notes. The Issuer’s ability to pay and refinance its debt or its ability to fund its working
capital and capital expenditures is heavily reliant on our future operating performance and our ability to generate a sufficient
cash flow. The Issuer may be unable to achieve any refinancing on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. The Issuer may
also be limited in our ability to pursue refinancing alternatives by the terms and conditions of its existing debt agreements.
The Issuer’s inability to refinance its debt obligations on or prior to their maturity on favorable terms or at all could have
a material adverse effect on its ability to service and repay the Notes.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company that does not have any revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have
any business operations or material assets (other than its shareholding in Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l.). Consequently,
payment of interest and repayment of its indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be dependent on the ability of its
subsidiaries to make such cash available to the Issuer, by either dividend distributions or intercompany loans, or both. The
Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness or by law,
to make such dividend distributions or advance upstream loans to enable it to make payments with respect to its
indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of its subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal
and contractual restrictions may limit its ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries.

While the Indenture and the terms of the Super Senior Facilities Agreement limit the ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and include contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make
other intercompany payments to it, these limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. The
Issuer cannot assure you that arrangements with its subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing
existing and future indebtedness of its subsidiaries and its results of operations and cash flow generally will provide it with
sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes.

In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions or other payments from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may
be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes. The Issuer does not expect to have any other
sources of funds that would allow the Issuer to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**_The Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral providers will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral
providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any
income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and
subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral providers may, among other things, without
any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as
selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments,
including repayments of indebtedness.

**_Not all of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes and the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally_**
**_subordinated to the liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Initial Guarantors.
Within 120 days following the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed on a
senior secured basis by Post-Issue Date Guarantors. For example, the accession of Kelvion B.V. as Post-Issue Date
Guarantor remains subject to works’ council approval. However, not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The
Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds
available for that purpose. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and
preference shareholders (if any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims
of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders under the Notes or the Guarantees. In the event of any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of any of the non-Guarantor entities, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be
entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution
to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors and, from the date such Guarantor becomes a borrower or guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement
until the date on which it grants a Guarantee, the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities) and preference shareholders (if
any) of our non-Guarantor entities. In addition, the terms of the Indenture as well as our other indebtedness allow the
non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future, which will be structurally senior to the Notes and the

48


-----

Guarantees. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the external revenue, aggregated EBITDA and
aggregated total assets, each calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding intra-group profits of the Issuer and the
Guarantors together represented 73.2%, 95.5% and 66.8% of the external revenue, aggregated EBITDA and total assets,
respectively, of the Group. As of March 31, 2024, the non-Guarantor entities had €5.1 million of current bank loans
primarily in Brazil and, to a minor extent, in France. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging_**
**_obligations, cash management obligations and certain additional indebtedness with “super senior” status are entitled_**
**_to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes._**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the related Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis
with security interests over the Collateral that also secures the obligations under the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging
obligations and cash management obligations. The Indenture also permits the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional
indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, the liabilities under the Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations, cash management obligations and
certain additional indebtedness will have priority to the Notes over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral
pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure on the
Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then-outstanding claims under the Super Senior Facilities,
certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds
from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Super Senior Facilities,
certain hedging obligations, certain cash management obligations and such additional “super senior” indebtedness have
been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by
the Collateral on an equal basis with the Notes.

**_The Collateral will secure amounts under certain guarantee facilities which are more likely to become due in_**
**_circumstances when an enforcement action may be taken._**

The Super Senior Facilities are comprised of the Cash RCF Facility and the L/G RCF Facility. The Cash RCF
Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances and any rollover drawings and/or by way of ancillary facilities
and/or fronted ancillary facilities. The L/G RCF Facility may be utilized by the issue of bank guarantees and letters of
credit under ancillary facilities.

In the ordinary course of business, amounts under the L/G RCF Facility are likely to operate in a contingent
manner rather than requiring immediate repayment. However, in the types of circumstances where the Collateral may
become enforceable, including upon a payment default or insolvency-related default under the Notes, the Cash RCF Facility
and the L/G RCF Facility, these contingent claims are likely to crystallize. This may occur, for instance, if third parties that
have been provided guarantees under contracts call on their guarantees. This will mean that amounts under such facilities
will become due and payable and will recover the proceeds of Collateral in priority to the Notes. See also “—Pursuant to
_the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations, cash_
_management obligations and certain additional indebtedness with “super senior” status are entitled to be repaid with the_
_proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes.”_

If the Super Senior Facilities are not repaid in full in prescribed amounts of time as set forth in the Intercreditor
Agreement, creditors under the Cash RCF Facility and the L/G RCF Facility as super senior creditors will become the
instructing group for enforcement of the security. See also “—Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions
_regarding the Collateral; —The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common Security Agent, who will also serve_
_as the security agent in relation to the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and any additional secured debt permitted to be_
_incurred under the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to additional indebtedness that the Issuer may incur to_**
**_the extent such debt is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes and the Guarantees._**

Although the Indenture restricts the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pledge any assets as collateral
to secure other debt and requires the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure the Notes equally and ratably if the
Issuer pledges any assets for the benefit of certain other debt, both the restriction on pledging assets or incurring liens and
the requirement to provide equal security to the Notes and the Guarantees are subject to a number of significant exceptions
and carve-outs. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” For example, if the Issuer or its
restricted subsidiaries acquire assets subject to security interests securing other indebtedness, such security interests will
be permitted to remain in place under the terms of the Indenture and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or
the Guarantees equally and ratably. To the extent that the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries pledges any assets for
the benefit of other debt without also securing the Notes and the Guarantees, the Notes and the Guarantees will be
effectively subordinated to such debt to the extent of the value of such assets. Because of the foregoing, holders of (present

49


-----

or future) secured debt of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries may recover disproportionately more on their claims than
the holders of the Notes in an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. The Collateral does not include all of the assets
of the Issuer and the Guarantors and therefore such other assets not forming part of the Collateral may be secured in favor
of other creditors using the aforementioned exceptions and carve-outs. The Issuer and the Guarantors may not have
sufficient assets remaining to satisfy their respective obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Collateral only extends to certain of our assets and may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes_**
**_and the Guarantees and such collateral may be diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by the Collateral, which will also secure the obligations under the
Super Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations on a first-priority basis. The
Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any
holders’ of the Notes rights to the Collateral may be diluted by the incurrence of any additional debt which is secured by
the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the Offering,
and the value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon
many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, economic conditions where
operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure
of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market
exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no
value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not
sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, the investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds
of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

**_The Notes will not be initially secured by all of the Collateral and the Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under “Description
_of the Notes—Security.” On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral. Within 120 days_
following the Issue Date, the Notes will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be secured by the Post-Issue Date
Collateral. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds received upon an enforcement or certain distressed
disposals of the Collateral will be paid to the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
counterparties and certain cash management providers, if any, in priority to the holders of the Notes. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The security interests over the Collateral will be subject to_
certain significant contractual and legal limitations or subject to certain defenses under applicable law as set forth under
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security
_Interests,” which limitations could be significant. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis_
by the Initial Guarantors. Within 120 days following the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be guaranteed, by the Post-Issue Date Guarantors. Each of the Guarantors will
also be a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees will be
subject to significant limitations as described in “Certain _Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted
or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee or security interest may be subject to claw-back provisions
under applicable local insolvency laws.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under
the Indenture and the terms of the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued.
The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of
the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the
ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements (including registration requirements), statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests
in collateral. For example, it may be difficult for the Security Agent to sell our assets in an enforcement scenario. The
Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. For example, pursuant to
Sections 55 et seq. of the German Foreign Trade Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) a purchase by a person not
resident in the European Union of shares in a German company may under certain circumstances require an approval by
the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie). Not obtaining

50


-----

such an approval may – depending on the character of the purchased company’s business – render the purchase
provisionally invalid (schwebend unwirksam). The denial of the approval would either render the purchase permanently
invalid or lead to additional obligations with respect to the relevant shares or the rescission (Rückabwicklung) of the
purchase.

The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent. In addition, the consents of any third parties may
not be given, when required, to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. In particular, to the extent that any other first-priority
and pre-existing security interests permitted under the Indenture and the terms of the Super Senior Facilities Agreement
and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, these parties may have or may exercise
rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement will_**
**_provide that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent in relation to the Super Senior Facilities_**
**_Agreement and any additional secured debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities_**
**_Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement._**

In general, the facility agent under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of the Notes and the agents
under any permitted future senior secured debt, voting as provided below, will have, subject to certain restrictions, the
ability to provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the shared Collateral. The Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that, where there is an inconsistency between enforcement instructions provided by the holders
of 66[2/3]% of the aggregate of all outstanding liabilities under the Cash RCF Facility, the L/G RCF Facility and certain
hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and the holders of more than 50% of the total “Majority
**Pari Passu Creditors,” being the aggregate of the Notes and all liabilities outstanding under any other indebtedness sharing**
the Collateral on a first-ranking basis, the latter instructions will prevail. However, if and to the extent the obligations under
the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and other super senior liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months
of the end of an initial consultation period or no enforcement action has been taken within three months of such date or an
insolvency event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) occurs, the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority
Super Senior Creditors will prevail. The lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
counterparties may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes, and they may, subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would
be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of other respects. Other
creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence an enforcement action against the Issuer or its
subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable
bankruptcy laws or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced.

In addition, in certain circumstances, including acceleration of the Super Senior Facilities, the Notes, any amounts
recovered from the enforcement of Collateral or other asset sales will be required to be turned over to the Security Agent.
Subject to the prior payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior Facilities, the Trustee and the Security
Agent, the Intercreditor Agreement requires the Security Agent to pay amounts turned over to it or otherwise received by
it with respect to the Notes, such as proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and other asset sales, to the lenders
under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging counterparties and certain cash management providers in
priority to the holders of the Notes.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance requirements and other limitations on the Guarantees_**
**_and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized
under the laws of Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. Enforcement of the obligations
under a Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor and/or security provider
will be subject to certain defenses available to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. These laws and defenses may
include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity
maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by
limiting the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable. The amounts recoverable thereunder
will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider
under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the
relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the
benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital
maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the
directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal
liability.

51


-----

For example, guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as general partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the_
purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders
(excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for
such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any
Guarantees and/or Collateral provided by a GmbH, including by German Holdco, will be subject to certain contractual
limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Guarantee
is granted) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance,
liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws.

In addition, any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138
of the BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee
and/or security interest, among others, the third-party creditor had colluded with the affiliate (kollusives Zusammenwirken)
to the detriment of the GmbH or other third-party creditors of the GmbH. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to
a GmbH & Co. KG.

As a result, a Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Guarantee or the Security Documents could be
materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This
could lead to a situation in which such Guarantee or Security Interest cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor
or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a
bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s
Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above-mentioned grounds and that the applicable court may
determine that the Guarantee or Security Interest should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the
relevant Guarantees or Security Interests apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities
of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future
Guarantees and Security Interests may be subject to similar limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

Similarly, a Guarantor incorporated and/or established in Luxembourg (the “Luxembourg Guarantor”) may only
encumber its assets or provide a guarantee in accordance with its corporate objects and for its corporate benefit. There is
no Luxembourg legislation governing group companies which specifically regulates the establishment, organization and
liability of groups of companies. Consequently, the concept of group interest as opposed to the interest of the individual
corporate entity is not expressly recognized. Except as described below, a company may, in principle, not encumber its
assets or provide guarantees in favor of group companies in general (at least as far as parent companies and fellow
subsidiaries of its parent companies are concerned).

Based on current case law and legal literature, a Luxembourg company may, in principle, validly assist other group
companies, in accordance with the provisions of the Luxembourg companies Law, if:

     - they are part of a group;

     - it can be established that the guarantor derives a benefit from granting such assistance or that, at least, there
is no disruption of the balance of interests in the group to the detriment of the Luxembourg Guarantor; and

     - the assistance is not, in terms of the amounts involved, disproportionate to the Luxembourg Guarantor’s
financial means and the benefits derived from granting such assistance.

In addition, the Guarantee and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its respective guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective
under applicable law. See also “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability
_of the Guarantees and Security Interests—Luxembourg.”_

**_Other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect_**
**_their validity and enforceability._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized
under the laws of Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the United States or other
relevant jurisdictions.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s or security provider’s obligations under its Guarantee
or the Collateral, as applicable, (ii) direct that the recipient returns any amounts paid under a Guarantee, or return any
proceeds received in connection with the enforcement of the Collateral, to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or

52


-----

to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or the security provider’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental
to you, typically if the court found that:

    - the relevant Guarantee was incurred, or the relevant Collateral was granted, with actual intent to give
preference to one creditor over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor
or security provider, as applicable, or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee or the
Collateral, as applicable, has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that
the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or the
Collateral, as applicable;

    - the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent
value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or the Collateral, as applicable, and the Guarantor or
security provider, as applicable, was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or
the Collateral, as applicable; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant
Guarantee or the Collateral, as applicable; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur,
indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

    - the relevant Guarantee or the Collateral, as applicable, was held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of
the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable; or

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or enforced or to be enforced under the relevant
Collateral, as applicable, was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or
similar laws may also apply to any future Guarantee or Collateral granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant
to the Guarantee Agreement.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security
provider, as applicable, was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would
not determine that a Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent on the date its
Guarantee was issued or the relevant Collateral was granted, as applicable, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted
preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, under its Guarantee or the Collateral, as
applicable, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or the Collateral, as applicable, not constituting
a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what
standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as
applicable. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or the relevant Collateral, as applicable, may be set aside, in
which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

Luxembourg laws contain similar specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
insolvency proceedings, the so-called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against
a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement
pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing
security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency of the relevant person by
the bankruptcy trustee or receiver in an insolvency proceeding of the relevant debtor or by any of the creditors of the
relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a
consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against
third parties under Luxembourg law if: (i) the act was performed with the intention to defraud the creditor; (ii) the creditor
concerned or, in the case of the relevant debtor’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the relevant person and the
counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such
knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the security
interests or the granting of a Guarantee, involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under
applicable law, then the issuance of such Notes, the granting of such security interests for the benefit of holders of the
relevant Notes or the granting of such Guarantees, as applicable, (i) could be declared unenforceable against the creditor
that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act (under Luxembourg law outside of bankruptcy proceedings) or (ii)
except for security interests which qualify as financial collateral arrangements under the Luxembourg law of August 5,
2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Financial Collateral Law 2005”), declared void vis-à-vis all
third-party creditors pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (under Luxembourg law in the case of
bankruptcy proceedings). As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of such
Notes, the Guarantees, or the security interests and the value of any consideration that holders of the relevant Notes,

53


-----

respectively, received with respect to the relevant series of Notes, security interests or guarantees, could also be subject to
recovery from the holders of the other Notes, and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such
circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or
the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance. See also “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests—Luxembourg.”_

If a court decided that a Guarantee or the relevant Collateral, as applicable, was a preference, fraudulent transfer
or conveyance and voided such Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you
may cease to have any claim with respect to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, and would be a
creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor or security provider under the relevant Guarantee or
the Collateral, as applicable, that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee or relevant Collateral, as
applicable, is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee or relevant
Collateral, as applicable, obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable
Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, and if the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes, or any
Guarantee or relevant Collateral, as applicable, is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise
set aside, the Issuer cannot assure you that it can repay in full the amounts outstanding under the Notes. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security_
_Interests.”_

**_Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the Collateral will thus be subject
to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies,
insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly
for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of
these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could
adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees. A
summary description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of the European Union, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Germany, the United States and Poland are set out in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_The Insolvency laws of Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and other applicable jurisdictions may not be_**
**_as favorable to you as the US bankruptcy laws or those insolvency laws of another jurisdiction with which you are_**
**_familiar with and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
event, proceedings could be initiated in Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the United States or other relevant
jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and otherwise may result
in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and there can be no
assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceedings.

Further to the above, in case of insolvency laws of Poland being primarily set out in the Bankruptcy Law dated
February 28, 2003, as amended (Prawo upadłościowe) (the “Polish Insolvency Law”), insolvency proceedings are not
initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require a debtor or creditor to file a petition to commence
insolvency proceedings (“bankruptcy petition”). The debtor is obliged, no later than within thirty (30) days from the day
on which the grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy arose, to file a bankruptcy petition with the court.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Non-US Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of
the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain
post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call
into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights
under the Notes and the related guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

For more information, regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and
security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor, as applicable, of the security. The liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected in terms of validity, enforceability, ranking or otherwise with respect
to the claims of the Notes if the Issuer, the Security Agent or any other third party fail or are unable to take the actions
(e.g., as for filing, registration, modification or other requirements) required to perfect any of these liens.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the
Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in
the same Collateral, and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly
perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor
receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken
over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes
determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date
over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate
register or by notification) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility
to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or
actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties. See “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests” for further_
information.

Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take
any steps or action to perfect any of these liens.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the Notes may fall within the scope of and the_**
**_granting of shared security interests in connection with the incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or re-_**
**_start, hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, when issued, may
fall within the scope of hardening periods or voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in accordance
with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions. In addition, the granting of shared security interests to secure future
indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods or voidance periods for
such security interests in Germany or certain jurisdictions, in particular as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking
of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future
indebtedness, the transfer of Collateral among the Issuer and its subsidiaries from time to time and the implementation of
certain corporate reorganizations. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run
from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. If the security interest were granted or created
or were to be enforced during the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for
the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

In addition, the granting of guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may be
at risk of falling within the scope of clawback rules if entered into during the hardening periods for such guarantees or
security interests in Luxembourg (save for financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg
Collateral Law. The applicable clawback rules for these guarantees and security interests will run from the moment each
guarantee, or security interest, has been granted or perfected, provided they take place during the hardening period. In case
any of the Luxembourg Guarantors and security providers was to be declared insolvent by the competent court, the court
could establish a period before the insolvency judgment (the so-called “hardening period”) within which the courtappointed insolvency receiver will have to carefully consider any transactions entered into during this hardening period.
With the exception of any security interest being financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg
Collateral Law, any guarantee or security interest entered into during the so-called “hardening period” will be analyzed by
the court-appointed insolvency receiver and may be, as the case may be, challenged by the court-appointed insolvency
receiver and may be declared void or ineffective by the competent court. See also “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests—Luxembourg.”_

**_The Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral for the benefit of holders of the Notes will be granted to the_**
**_Security Agent rather than directly to you. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted_**
**_by local law._**

The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees of the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders
of the Notes. Instead, they will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent.

The Indenture will provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Guarantees in accordance with the terms thereof. As a
consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests or Guarantee claims and will not be entitled to take
enforcement action with respect to the Collateral securing the Notes or the Guarantees, except through the Trustee, who
will (on behalf of the holders of the Notes and subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement)
provide instructions to the Security Agent with respect to the Collateral or the Guarantees.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example,
the laws of certain jurisdictions, such as Germany, may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require
a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. In certain jurisdictions, including, among others,
Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and
enforceability of such security interests, the respective Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the
“Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu
of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have
legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the
original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of
the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment with
respect to the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment with respect to the
parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to
the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt
structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its
efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel
debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even
loss of the Collateral or Guarantees.

**_Holders of the Notes must rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor Agreement to implement parity among the_**
**_secured parties._**

Due to the laws and case law applicable to the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of
such security interests in Germany, certain Collateral will secure only the Parallel Debt Obligation created under the
Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the obligations under the Notes directly.
Accordingly, the parity of the Notes, obligations under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, including the Cash RCF
Facility and the L/G RCF Facility, and any other obligations secured by the Collateral will be implemented by way of the
Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, the holders of the Notes must rely on the effectiveness of the Intercreditor Agreement
to implement parity among the holders of the Notes and the other pari passu secured creditors, including the lenders under
the Super Senior Facilities Agreement. In the event that the Intercreditor Agreement does not ensure parity on a contractual
basis, the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the obligations under the Notes.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.”_

**_Certain subsidiaries of the Issuer will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries and therefore not subject to the restrictive covenants_**
**_under the Indenture._**

Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC and Enexio Poland Sp. z o.o. as well as their respective subsidiaries will be an
Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and will not be part of the Restricted Group (as defined under “Description
_of Notes”). Because they are not part of the Restricted Group, Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC and Enexio Poland Sp. z o.o. as_
well as their respective will not be subject to the restrictive covenants set out in the Indenture and can engage in e.g., asset
sales, restricted payments, incurrence of debt and other restricted transactions without being limited by the Indenture.
Neither Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC, Enexio Poland Sp. z o.o. nor any of their respective subsidiaries will guarantee the
Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the aggregated revenue, aggregated EBITDA and
aggregated total assets, each calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding intra-group profits, of Kelvion
Mashimpeks LLC and its subsidiaries together represented 1.1%, 1.6% and 1.2% of our total revenue, EBITDA and total

-----

assets, respectively. While no separate financial information for Enexio Poland Sp. z o.o. for the year ended December 31,
2023 is available, we believe that the company is non-operating and does not have any significant revenue, Enexio Poland
Sp. z o.o. may file for insolvency, liquidation or another restructuring in the future.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes, under which the Collateral and the_**
**_Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your_**
**_further consent._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released automatically
without consent of the holders of the Notes, including upon a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a
transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture, and in connection with an enforcement sale
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture also permits the Issuer to designate one or more restricted
subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If the Issuer designates a Guarantor as an unrestricted
subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of
the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an
unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens
securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release
_of Liens” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Release of the Guarantees.”_

Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to
release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations secured by
such security. Finally, if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory security
interest created pursuant to a security document governed by German law might be released as a matter of German law.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repay the Notes when due or to repurchase the Notes when the Issuer is required to do so_**
**_pursuant to certain events constituting a Change of Control or otherwise, and the Change of Control provision_**
**_contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes, following an event of default including
a cross-acceleration event, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due and payable. In addition,
upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control, holders of the Notes may in certain circumstances
require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus
accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Change
_of Control.” The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay these_
amounts when they become due.

The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control
event would result in an event of default under the Notes. The Issuer cannot assure you that it would have sufficient funds
to repay its outstanding indebtedness that it would be required to prepay or offer to purchase or that became immediately
due and payable as a result. The Issuer may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases and
the Issuer cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions in the
Issuer’s other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict it from making such required repurchases.

A Change of Control may result in an event of default under or acceleration of the Issuer’s then-existing
indebtedness (including under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement), and the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an
offer could cause a default under such indebtedness even if the Change of Control itself does not. The Change of Control
provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate
events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transactions involving the Issuer that may adversely
affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they
do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.

The definition of “Change of Control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case law in some
jurisdictions interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or offer to purchase the Notes, the Issuer may, at its option,_**
**_redeem the Notes of non-tendering holders._**

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the Notes, holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture

57


-----

will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price equal to that paid pursuant to such
purchase or tender offer (excluding any early tender premium). As a consequence, you may be required to surrender the
Notes against your will at a price equivalent to the lowest price paid to tendering holders, including if such price is below
par, and you may not receive the return you expected to receive on the Notes. See “Description of the Notes⸻Post Tender
_Redemption.”_

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes receive a rating of “BBB−” or
better from S&P and “Baa3” or better from Moody’s and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing,
then beginning that day and continuing until such time that the Notes receive a rating of below “BBB−” from S&P and
below “Baa3” from Moody’s, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” In addition, the security_
interests over the Collateral may be released and may not be retaken if the new rating is not maintained. If these covenants
were to cease to be applicable, the Issuer would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including
dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the
Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for US securities laws violations._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the Guarantors are organized
under the laws of Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. Each member of the Issuer’s
management team and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors (other than Kelvion, Inc. and Kelvion
Products, Inc.) (the “Non-US Guarantors”) are non-residents of the United States, and all of the Issuer’s assets and the
assets of the Non US-Guarantors and such persons are located outside the United States. It may not be possible for investors
to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, a Non-US Guarantor or such persons or to enforce
against any of them in US courts judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of
the United States, and there is doubt as to the enforceability in the home jurisdictions of the Non-US Guarantors of civil
liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States, either in original actions or in actions for
enforcement of judgments of US courts. It may also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within
Germany and Poland upon the Issuer or the Non-US Guarantors. If a judgment is obtained in a US court against the Issuer
or any Non-US Guarantor or a security provider, investors may need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the
relevant company has assets. As all the assets of the Issuer and the Non-US Guarantors and the assets of its and their
directors are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the US courts against
them. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United
States, or to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act and
the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. See “Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of
holders of Notes to ensure that their purchase and any subsequent transfer of the Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. Any of these restrictions and requirements will limit the ability of
investors to resell the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited._**

The Notes will be new securities for which there is no market. The Issuer cannot assure you as to the liquidity of
any market that may develop for the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes or the prices at which you would be able to sell
your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities
has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The
liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities
and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject
to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects
and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in
the Notes. The Initial Purchasers are not, however, obliged to do so, and they may discontinue any market-making activities
at any time without notice. As a result, there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. If no
active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

58


-----

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain
the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange for so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot
assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the
Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain
such listing, provided that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on
another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be another stock exchange that is not regulated by
the European Union), although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.

Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the
Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of
the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a
material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Issuer may at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the Trustee, delist the Notes
from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of the Notes to another recognized stock exchange for high
yield issuers (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union).

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes offered hereby are denominated and payable in euros. If you measure your investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange risks related to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which you
measure the return on your investments because of economic, political and other factors over which the Issuer has no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments
could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below the stated coupon rate and could result in a loss to you
when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your
investments. In addition, there may be tax consequences to holders subject to US federal income tax as a result of any
foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from an investment in the Notes. See “Taxation—Certain US Federal Income
_Tax Considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision,_**
**_suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

The credit ratings assess the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks
in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the
potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject
to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit
rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time
of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms of
the Issuer’s financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The Notes will be initially held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing_**
**_systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in exchange for
book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will not be
considered owners or holders of the Notes. The nominee of the common depository for Euroclear and Clearstream will be
the sole registered holder of the global notes with respect to the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, as principal paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments
will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and
credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the
owners of book-entry interests.

Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through
which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

59


-----

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a
book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for
the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for US federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with OID for US federal income tax purposes. In such event, holders subject to US
federal income tax will generally be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a
constant yield to maturity basis) for US federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which
such OID is attributable and regardless of the holder’s regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes.
See “Taxation—Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The Issuer estimates that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €425.0 million. The Issuer intends to use
the gross proceeds from the Offering (i) to redeem the Existing Notes in full, (ii) for general corporate purposes, including
expenses expected to be incurred in connection with a production footprint alignment program in the EMEA region as well
as certain capital expenditures and (iii) to pay costs, fees and expenses related to the Transactions.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds of the Issuer. The actual amounts set forth
in the table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustment and may differ from our estimate of costs, fees
and expenses. You should read the table below in conjunction with the information contained elsewhere in this Offering

**Overview**

We are a leading global provider of heat exchanger solutions with more than 100 years of experience in design,
manufacturing, installation and service (source: Frost & Sullivan Report). We have built our strategic pillars on (i) High
Tech applications and solutions, in particular for Data Centers with liquid and free cooling, (ii) Green Tech applications
and solutions in various vertical markets, such as Power & Energy, HVAC, Hydrogen, Liquified Natural Gas, Carbon
Capture Storage, (iii) Conventional applications, such as in the Refrigeration, Food & Beverage, Chemicals and Oil & Gas
vertical markets, as well as (iv) Service applications across all our vertical markets and product groups. Our diversified
presence across regions and transformative industries are supported by long-term underlying megatrends, such as
digitalization, energy transition and environmental concerns in general. Based on the breath of our product portfolio,
extensive global footprint, and diverse end-markets, as well as our technology leadership position and R&D capabilities,
we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth trends in our vertical markets.

Since 2021, under our new management, we have been implementing a comprehensive strategic program known
as “High Five”. The High Five program is designed to build a long-term sustainable business and comprises the following
five strategic pillars: (i) Grow High Tech, (ii) Grow Green Tech, (iii) More Service, (iv) Grow APAC & Americas and (v)
More Digitalization, with greater emphasis on reducing complexity through digitalization. At the same time, we divested
unprofitable businesses, such as the Enexio in recent years. Since the beginning of 2021 and despite several external shocks,
such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the spike in energy prices and inflation caused thereby, our Order Intake, Revenue and
Normalized EBITDA have increased from €1,099.3 million, €931.7 million and €78.8 million, respectively, for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to €1,697.9 million, €1,347.9 million and €146.9 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2023. Historically, our business operations have been primarily divided into four product groups: Kelvion
Thermal Solutions (“KTS”), Refrigeration Technologies (“RT”), Plate Heat Exchangers (“PHE”) and Machine Cooling
Systems (“MCS”). We also consider our key vertical markets and geographic regions in the management of our business.

      - _KTS provides air fin coolers and cooling towers for installations with large cooling requirements as well_
as air dryers used to remove humidity from air streams. KTS focuses on providing customized solutions

65


-----

and primarily serves Data Centers, Power & Energy, Oil & Gas and Chemicals vertical markets. For the
twelve months ended March 31, 2024, KTS accounted for 44.6% of our revenue.

      - _RT supplies standard and customized heat exchangers for cooling and removing heat in different_
applications using air and liquid cooling methods. The primary vertical markets are HVAC, refrigeration
applications and Data Centers. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, RT accounted for 20.5%
of our revenue.

      - _PHE offers a range of gasketed, brazed and welded plate heat exchangers for a variety of applications_
and vertical markets, including HVAC, Food & Beverage, Chemicals, Power & Energy and Heavy &
Light Equipment. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, PHE accounted for 17.9% of our
revenue.

      - _MCS supplies heat exchangers for power generation, power transmission, large engine applications_
(marine and off-highway) and Green Tech applications such as biomass, green hydrogen, or renewable
energies. The primary vertical markets are Transportation, Heavy & Light Equipment, Power & Energy
and Oil & Gas. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, MCS accounted for 14.3% of our revenue.

Since the beginning of 2024, the RT, MCS and PHE have been managed on a regional basis in the following
geographic regions – Americas, APAC and EMEA.

In addition, all our product groups’ activities are complemented by a comprehensive after-sales support and
services offering, reflecting our ability to support our customers with full-service packages thereby reducing their operating
costs. We provide services both for our own products as well as for third-party products, managed on a centralized and
global basis across our product groups. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our service business generated
revenues of €251 million and for the year ended December 31, 2023 revenues of €259 million, an increase of 21% compared
to the year ended December 31, 2022.

We have a large and diverse customer base, including many blue-chip customers, and have built long-standing
customer partnerships. Our customer base comprises more than 19,000 active customers (i.e., customers that have placed
an order with us in the last 24 months) and repeat orders over multiple years from more than 12,000 customers. Our
customer base is also diversified across vertical markets and geographies. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024,
our Order Intake by strategic pillar can be broken down as follows: circa 39% in High Tech, circa 36% in Conventional
applications, circa 17% in services and circa 7% in Green Tech. During the same period, the Order Intake by geography
comprised circa 45% in EMEA, circa 42% in Americas and circa 13% in APAC.

Headquartered in Herne, Germany, we operate in 24 countries around the world, with 22 production facilities, 33
service centers and 19 engineering centers as of March 31, 2024. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we
generated total revenue of €1,401 million and Normalized EBITDA of €157.2 million.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

**_Demand for our products and solutions in our strategic pillars, particularly in Green Tech and High Tech_**

Our business and results of operations are influenced by trends in our key strategic pillars and key vertical markets
as well as changes in the general macroeconomic conditions in our core geographic regions which, in turn, drive the
level of demand for our products and solutions. For example, the High Tech market, which accounted for 39% of our
Order Intake for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, is projected to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2022 to 2027
due to strong and growing demand for data centers. The Green Tech market, which accounted for 7% of our Order Intake
for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% between 2022 to 2027 based on
an increasing focus on energy efficiency and environmental awareness, which, in turn, is driving regulatory changes
aimed at climate protection and heat recovery for residential and commercial buildings as well as for industrial
applications (source: Frost & Sullivan Report, MarketsandMarkets Report, Third Party Report and internal company
assessments). These megatrends are aligned to two of our High Five strategies. See “Business–Our Strategy” for more
information on our High Five program.

Similar global trends and industrialization in our conventional vertical markets underpin growth prospects in a
number of industries, with the services market changing due to a shift towards and higher demand for smart services.
We believe that the developments in these markets have been, and will continue to be, driven in particular by further
changes to the regulatory environment, such as the global ambition to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero
and supporting legislative actions as well as the desire to increase the resilience of supply chains in the wake of the
COVID-19 induced disruptions and political tensions.

In particular in our key vertical markets, fluctuations in growth rates or growth forecasts can result in significant
changes in demand for our products if our customer and end-customers in the relevant vertical market curtails their

66


-----

investment activity, for example, during economic downturns. Overall, our revenue and results of operations have been
influenced, and will continue to be influenced, by secular megatrends and macroeconomic conditions.

**_Development of our Project Business_**

A significant, and increasing, portion of our total revenue is generated from our project business, which includes
construction and conversion projects and upgrades of existing facilities. KTS, our largest segment by revenue, focuses on
large project business for demanding applications in High Tech, Green Tech and Conventional vertical markets such as Oil
& Gas and Chemicals. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, revenue generated by KTS amounted to
€294.4 million, €413.5 million and €591.9 million, respectively, or 31.6%, 38.4% and 43.9% of our total revenue for the
respective years. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2023, Order Intake from KTS’ larger projects (with an order
value of more than €5 million) accounted for 66% of KTS’ Order Intake with an average order size of €25.8 million and
serving 11 customers globally. KTS’ high order intake level in 2023 was primarily attributable to high demand in the
vertical markets Data Center (increase of approximately 80% compared to 2022) as well as Oil & Gas, Chemicals and
Power & Energy (increase of approximately 139% compared to 2022), which includes the carbon capture business in North
America.

Profit margins are driven by product mix and timing of long-term projects. Moreover, profit margins realized on
certain projects and long-term contracts can vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity
during the execution of the project. Whereas the project business may be less predictable and affected by individual large
projects, working capital requirements are generally lower than for the component business due to milestone payments
from customers, which have significantly contributed to lower levels of trade working capital since the year ended
December 31, 2021. Over time this advanced cash is reduced as projects are started and materials are purchased due to
requirements for the manufacturing of the equipment. As such the cash balances is expected to normalize as cash is
consumed and production executed. Cash balances can also be impacted by the timing of payments and earlier or delayed
payments can have an impact. We recognize revenue from certain of our project contracts using the percentage-ofcompletion method of accounting whereby revenue and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined
based on our estimate of the project status and costs remaining to complete the project. Estimates of total revenue and cost
at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract, labor costs and material
costs. Delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenue and margins for affected periods.

The projects in which we participate can be split into several different phases of their life cycle: the bidding and
development phase, the design and engineering and the production phase, and the delivery and commissioning phase. In
the bidding phase, we incur costs which are not initially matched by any revenue. In the development and design and
engineering phases, we typically benefit from milestone payments from our customers. As the project proceeds, cash
inflows are reduced with supplier payments.

**_Prices of raw materials and ability to increase prices and pass on cost increases_**

The primary raw materials used for the manufacture of our products are steel, copper, aluminum and titanium. For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our total cost of materials amounted to €604.3 million and €756.6 million,
of which expenses for raw materials and supplies amounted to €564.9 million and €710.8 million, respectively. Although
fluctuations in prices of raw materials and supply chain can impact our profitability, we capitalize on our ability to pass on
costs to our customers. The market price and availability of these products can fluctuate sharply depending on the market
situation. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant fluctuations in the price of copper on the London
Metal Exchange, with a decrease of up to 20% around the outbreak and spread of the pandemic followed significant price
increases in the subsequent two years. Elevated price levels of copper have since been persisting. Over the past three
months, copper prices have shown some volatility but generally remained within a high range. As of early June 2024,
copper was priced at approximately U.S.$9,840 per metric ton, down slightly from peaks close to U.S.$11,000 seen earlier
in the year. The fluctuations are primarily due to varying industrial demand, particularly from construction and electronics
sectors, along with supply disruptions affecting global markets (source: Markets Insider). Aluminum prices have
experienced a steady upward trend between March and May of 2024. By the end of May 2024, aluminum was priced at
approximately U.S.$2,564 per metric ton, rising from approximately U.S.$2,226 in March 2024. This increase is driven by
strong demand from the automotive and aerospace industries, compounded by supply constraints from major production
sources.

These trends reflect the broader economic and industrial activities influencing both metals, highlighting the
ongoing demand pressures and supply chain issues impacting their markets. While we currently do not use commodity
derivatives as hedging instruments against price fluctuations of raw materials, we have entered into longer-term supply
agreements with various suppliers in order to reduce commodity price risk. Although this does not fully shield us from
the underlying commodity price risks, it provides us with balanced safeguarding mechanisms.

In addition to the structure of our cost base, a primary factor affecting our margin is the absolute level of costs
and our ability to manage our operating costs, are the prices that we can charge to our customers for our products. Our

profitability is also affected by our ability to offset increasing operating costs (such as from inflation) through
improvements in our production efficiency as well as our ability to pass at least some of such cost increases on to our
customers. Based on our high-quality portfolio of technologically advanced products and customer-specific application
services, our sales force focusing on projects and customer-specific solutions, and the strength of our Kelvion brand, we
believe that we will be able to continue to agree price adjustments with customers in order to pass on increased raw material
and input prices to our customers. The possibilities to pass on higher input prices to an end customer vary based on the
customer and relevant market depending on the competition. In addition, we purchase a variety of intermediate products
produced by other manufacturers that are integrated into the final products we provide to our end-customers. These include
finished mechanical components such as fans and chiller units. Any price increases by our suppliers will result in higher
costs of materials If we are not able to pass price increases on to our customers, such price increases could reduce our profit
margins. See “Risk Factors—Increases in raw material prices, energy costs and prices for input materials and intermediate
_products may result in higher manufacturing or purchasing costs and lower margins, and we may not be able to pass on_
_such increased costs to our customers fully or at all.”_

**_Demand for service offerings_**

We support our product groups and project businesses with our service offerings in all product groups through our
33 service centers around the world. The offering of our Service business varies in each legal entity to align with the
respective products or specializations of the relevant manufacturing unit. However, the service offering is coordinated on
a regional or segment basis for KTS. Service customers tend to be customers of our products as well as third-party products,
whereby each product group’s installed base of products acts as an important driver. We believe our one-stop shop product
and service offering is important to our customers and helps to drive our product sale and project business by our ability to
offer services locally complementary to our local production capabilities. Compared to smaller, regionally focused
competitors, we believe we have a better understanding of technical, health, safety and environmental regulation standards
globally and locally, as well as the scale and logistical strength to carry out large projects which are often more profitable.
Our global scale underpins the strength of our brand, which positions us well to continue to strengthen our positions across
our strategic pillars and key vertical markets.

Our service offering comprises our recurring component business but also more often than not is the provision of
specific customer requirements. Our service portfolio consists of inhouse servicing, field service, spare parts, replacement
and upgrades as well as modernization. Training and consulting is also performed where customer needs require.

Our service offering is a key contributor to our revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our services revenue
amounted to €259 million (19% of total revenue) compared to €215 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 (19% of
total revenue). In the three months ended March 31, 2024 our services revenue amounted to €58 million (17% of total
revenue).

**_Technological innovation and investments_**

Our strong engineering solutions application capabilities are important for the continued success of our business
and maintaining our leading positions in our strategic pillars and key vertical end markets. Our application engineering
expertise, production and process know-how are based on decades of experience and supported by our network of 19
engineering centers around the world. Consequently, our research and development expenses primarily relate to personnel
expenses related to our network of engineering centers. Our engineers also support our sales team by advising on new
projects, develop and test new product applications through our global solutions engineering team. We have an agile
customer development approach by being able to pool specialists to support a customer enquiry from quote to order to
delivered engineering solution. Resulting in bespoke engineering solutions with a fast turnaround. Our manufacturing
technology also allows us to handle rare material requests e.g. electron beam welding, auto weld high pressure chambers
or diffusion welding. Our technology teams’ approach to development projects puts the customer at the center of the
program leading to a short time to market building on variations of in-house technology and expertise.

Our total R&D expenses in the year ended December 31, 2023 were €16.5 million compared to €14.0 million in the
year ended December 31, 2022 and €12.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. However, as a percentage of
revenue, R&D expenses remained stable at 1.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023 (years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021: 1.3% and 1.3%, respectively). Given that these expenses are primarily driven by personnel headcount and
expenses, we expect the ratio of such expenses to revenue to remain relatively low and stable.

Our capital expenditures amounted to €8.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, €56.6 million in
the year ended December 31, 2023, €34.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and €33.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021. In 2022 and 2023, we mainly invested in operations where investment was required for
growth in new products and vertical markets, as well as replacement of equipment and machinery. Our ratio of capital
expenditures to revenue during the three years ended December 31, 2023 was 3.7%.

68


-----

For the year ending December 31, 2024, we have budgeted approximately €45 million of capital expenditures,
including for investments in manufacturing improvement, new Green Tech solutions as well as upgrades to our enterprise
resource program software to SAP S/4 Hana and excluding any capital expenditures in connection with the planned
EMEA production footprint alignment program. For additional information, see “—Capital Expenditures.”

**_Exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations_**

With operations in 24 countries around the world, we enter into contracts denominated in various different
currencies. In particular, as a result of our international operations, our cash flows are denominated (apart from euro) mainly
in U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi. The cash inflows, in particular those in U.S. dollars, expose us to translation risks as
a result of exchange rate fluctuations. We intend to proactively manage translation risks by following our prudent financial
policy, including hedging foreign currency risks on an opportunistic basis. Due to our growth in the United States and
APAC regions in recent years, the portion of our revenues and costs denominated in U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi is
expected to increase. We hedge foreign currency items as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates, and
limit some currency risk, mainly from sales and procurement transactions. A depreciation of other currencies against the
euro means that, despite constant sales volumes and nominally constant prices, will, after translation into euro, generate
lower revenue and profits for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations
expose us to translation risks, as all non-euro financial results our companies must be translated into euro when preparing
our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, see Notes 10.2 and 3 of our 2023 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements.

**_Seasonality_**

Our business operations and results of operations are impacted to a limited degree by seasonality, primarily as a
result of holiday seasons. For example, the fourth quarter of the year is typically affected by a shut-down or slow-down of
our production facilities over Christmas, and the first quarter of the year can be affected by New Year and Chinese New
Year celebrations where some of our customers temporarily reduce or shut down their business. As a result, our revenue
and trade working capital w/o retention show a certain seasonal pattern, with the strongest output and results of operation
typically being in the second and third quarters of the year.

**Key Items of Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss**

**_Revenue. We report revenue according to three revenue types, namely construction contracts, sale of goods and_**
services and service agreements. Revenues from construction contracts are recognized over time in accordance with IFRS
15 (“percentage-of-completion method”) since the customer obtains control through their specifications over the duration
of the contract and because we are entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred so far, plus an appropriate margin, if the
customer cancels a contract. Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognized when such goods are transferred
to the customer, or when services were carried out, and the contractual performance obligations are therefore met. Revenue
from service agreements is recognized over the period in which the service is performed. If only the sale of spare parts is
involved, revenue is recognized at a specific point in time.

**_Cost of sales consists of costs of raw materials, direct labor and supplies and purchased services._**

**_Selling expenses are primarily related to compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel,_**
commissions for agents, logistics costs, advertising costs, trade fairs, travel expenses related to our sales and marketing
operations and other marketing costs.

**_Research and Development expenses consist primarily of personnel, material and other costs directly linked to_**
Research and Development throughout our businesses. Development activity relating to specific orders and customer
specifications is not recognized as Research and Development expenses but in cost of sales. Development costs that are
designed to significantly enhance a product or process are capitalized if completion of the product or process is technically
and economically feasible, the development is marketable, the expenditures can be measured reliably, and adequate
resources are available to complete the development project. All other Development expenditures are recognized
immediately as expenses. Capitalized Development costs for intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for
impairment once a year. Development costs that are required under construction contracts are capitalized as part of the cost
of the asset.

**_General and administrative expenses primarily comprise expenses related to functions such as finance, legal, IT,_**
HR and general management.

**_Other income consists primarily of income from exchange rates gains, income from reversals of impairment of_**
asset, and realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency derivatives and income from asset disposals.

69


-----

**_Other expenses primarily comprise expenses from exchange rate losses, losses on the measurement of foreign_**
currency derivatives, bad debt allowances on trade receivables, other taxes, losses on the disposal of assets and impairment
of non-current assets and assets held for sale.

**_Interest income consists of interest income on receivables, cash investments and marketable securities as well as_**
other interest income from third parties (mainly related to demand deposit accounts).

**_Interest expense consists of interest expenses on bonds and liabilities to banks, interest of expense – IFRS 16_**
leases and other interest on provisions and liabilities and interest and similar expenses.

**_Income taxes_** consist of current taxes and deferred taxes. Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or tax
receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of
previous years. Deferred taxes are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting and the amount used for taxation purposes.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €145,496 thousand, or 15.6%, from €931,742 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €1,077,238 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to positive
growth in the HVAC & Refrigeration end-markets (Data Center business as the main driver) in our two largest regions
Western Europe and North America.

Revenue in RT increased by €32,082 thousand, or 13.2%, from €242,458 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €274,540 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by
considerable volume growth and price increases, offset, in part by an initially weaker start of the year in the Americas and
ongoing supply chain challenges.

Revenue in MCS increased by €36,426 thousand, or 25.5%, from €142,865 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €179,291 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to
performance in the power, marine and other industries, which collectively accounted for nearly all of the product group’s
revenue and the strength of the product group in Western Europe, Asia Pacific and North America.

Revenue in KTS increased by €119,061 thousand, or 40.4%, from €294,446 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €413,507 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly due to
improving order intake throughout the second half of 2021 and 2022, mainly driven by KTS’ expanding Data Center
business as well as improvement in the Oil & Gas end-markets. In 2021, revenue in KTS included non-recurring revenue
of €38.7 million from an arbitration award related to a legacy power project in South Africa.

Revenue in PHE increased by €34,861 thousand, or 16.7%, from €208,544 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €243,405 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven mainly by an increase in volumes
of brazed plate heat exchangers for the booming heat pump industry as well as the expanding service business.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by €143,078 thousand, or 19.1%, from €749,088 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €892,166 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was in line with the development of sales revenue.

_Selling expenses_

Selling expenses decreased by €2,691 thousand, or 3.4%, from €78,698 thousand in the year ended December 31,
2021 to €76,007 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in
the number of sales employees.

_Research and development expenses_

Research and development expenses increased by €1,850 thousand, or 15.3%, from €12,113 thousand in the year
ended December 31, 2021 to €13,963 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in personnel expenses due to a combination of payroll inflation and to an average of 6 additional
R&D engineers.

_General and administrative expenses_

General and administrative expenses increased by €6,205 thousand, or 7.7%, from €80,161 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to €86,366 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly due to the
increase in our revenue in 2022 and costs related to the carveout of KTS.

_Other income_

Other income decreased by €16,941 thousand, or 37.2%, from €45,512 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €28,571 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reassessment of provisions relating to the winding down of the ACC business of ENEXIO recognized in 2021.

_Other expenses_

Other expenses increased by €3,774 thousand, or 14.5%, from €26,057 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €29,831 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase mainly resulted from exchange rate losses
of €15,133 thousand (2021: €7,204 thousand) which decreased broadly in line with gains from exchange rate differences.

_Interest income_

Interest income decreased by €6,261 thousand from €6,657 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€396 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly driven by the result of arbitration award
of the Medupi project in 2022.

_Interest expenses_

Interest expenses decreased by €2,312 thousand, or 4.0%, from €58,384 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €56,072 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest expenses amounted to €56,072 thousand in 2022
(2021: €58,384 thousand), mainly consisting of interest expenses (including the release of capitalized financing cost)
relating to the Existing Notes amounting to €33,183 thousand (2021: €33,565 thousand), interest on TPECs of €11,351
thousand (2021: €11,351 thousand), interest expenses on liabilities to banks of €5,837 thousand (2021: €6,956 thousand)
mainly resulting from guarantee commissions of €5,052 thousand (2021: €6,085 thousand), and interest expenses on the
Existing L/G Facility Agreement amounting to €2,254 thousand (2021: €32 thousand).

_Income taxes_

Income taxes changed by €31,396 thousand from a tax expense of €18,829 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to tax income of €12,567 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. Despite negative earnings
before tax (“EBT”), our incurred current tax expenses of €11,019 thousand and a net deferred tax income of €23,586
thousand (2021: total income taxes of €18,829 thousand, thereof current tax expenses €12,561 thousand and net deferred
tax expenses of €6,268 thousand). Current taxes mainly relate to the positive EBT in several legal entities that cannot be
offset with losses in other jurisdictions.

_Profit or loss for the period_

Profit or loss for the period improved by €2,865 thousand, or 7.1%, from a loss of €40,565 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to a loss of €37,700 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was the result
of the factors described above and despite the challenging market environment in 2022 and excluding the extraordinary
expenses mainly related to restructuring and similar expenses.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our principal sources of funds have been cash generated from our operating activities. Our principal uses of cash
are funding the daily business, working capital and capital expenditures. We expect to meet our requirements for the next
twelve months primarily from cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we utilize factoring agreements to support
our liquidity needs and manage our working capital. As of March 31, 2024, €27.3 million were utilized under our existing
factoring agreements and €85 million were available for utilization. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Factoring Arrangements.”_

From time to time, we also enter into bilateral facilities with local lenders to fund working capital and capital
expenditure requirements. As of March 31, 2024, we had bilateral facilities in Brazil and, to a minor extent, in France and
our liabilities under these bank loans amounted to €5.1 million.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our
anticipated liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating
activities to meet these needs or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to
fund our liquidity needs. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Cash Flow_**

The following table shows the principal components of our cash flows for the periods indicated below:

- Comprises unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents. Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents in the Group’s legal entities in
Russia. See Note 4.8 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash flows from operating activities.

Cash flows from operating activities decreased by €23,745 thousand, or 50.7%, from an inflow of €46,844
thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to an inflow of €23,099 thousand for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower pre-payments received from customers in the three
months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the period in the prior year.

Cash flows from operating activities increased by €49,804 thousand from €29,796 thousand in the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €79,600 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to
a change in provisions of €51,158 thousand, mainly driven by the settlement of a legacy project for the construction of a
dry cooling solution for a power station in South Africa and the release of a provision made in 2021, which more than
offset the decrease of €22,873 thousand of EBIT to €7,118 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022 from €29,991
thousand in the prior year. The increase was attributable to an increase in cash inflow of €3,977 thousand from trade
working capital as well as €2,901 thousand lower tax payments.

Cash flows from operating activities increased by €138,187 thousand from €79,600 thousand in the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €217,787 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable
to higher EBIT of €65,418 thousand compared to €7,118 thousand in the prior year as well as an improvement in trade
working capital.

_Cash flows from investing activities_

Cash flows from investing activities decreased by €2,081 thousand, or 19.9%, from an outflow of €10,465
thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to an outflow of €8,384 thousand for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to phasing of projects spend at comparative times.

Cash flows from investing activities increased by €4,859 thousand, or 17.0%, from an outflow of
€28,623 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2021 to an outflow of €33,482 thousand in the year ended December 31,
2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the sustained high level of investment activity in 2022. Cash outflows in
2022 related to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as to intangible assets of €34,769 thousand. The
proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets and assets held for sale amounted to €1,287 thousand and related to the
replacement of non-material equipment.

Cash flows from investing activities increased by €12,672 thousand, or 37.8%, from an outflow of
€33,482 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022 to an outflow of €46,154 thousand in the year ended December 31,
2023. Cash outflows in 2023 related to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as to intangible assets of
€56,605 thousand. The proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets and assets held for sale amounted to
€10,451 thousand, which related primarily to the sale of land and buildings in France which was recorded as an asset held
for sale.

_Cash flows from financing activities_

Cash flows from financing activities decreased by €2,822 thousand, or 28.1%, from an outflow of
€10,044 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to an outflow of €7,222 thousand for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower utilisation under the Existing RCF Agreement and
reduced utilisations under the Existing L/G Facility Agreement.

Cash flows from financing activities decreased by €15,858 thousand from an outflow of €22,237 thousand in the
year ended December 31, 2021 to an outflow of €6,379 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash outflows
from financing activities in 2022 primarily consisted of interest payments (€41,734 thousand, 2021: €18,098 thousand),
payments from finance lease (€12,706 thousand, 2021: €20,016 thousand), as well as proceeds from the revolving credit
facility (€50,000 thousand, 2021: €15,000 thousand). The higher interest payments in 2022 related mainly to the deferral
of the payment of interest on the Existing Notes in December 2021 (€14.2 million) and lower interest on the Existing L/G
Facility Agreement.

Cash flows from financing activities increased by €108,269 thousand from an outflow of €6,379 thousand in the
year ended December 31, 2022 to an outflow of €114,648 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash outflows
from financing activities in 2023 primarily consisted of repayment under the revolving credit facility of €65,000 thousand,
and interest payments of €40,522 thousand.

**Trade Working Capital**

Trade working capital w/o retention is calculated as inventories plus trade receivables and contract assets less
accounts payables and advanced payments & contract liabilities. The internal “trade working capital” includes also
factoring and customer retention as these derive from operational business even if retentions are part of financial receivables
in accordance with IFRS. For internal purposes, retentions are shown as trade receivables. The table below sets forth certain
line items from our consolidated statement of financial position for the periods indicated:

_December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022_

As of December 31, 2023, our trade working capital w/o retention amounted to €15.2 million, a decrease of €69.0
million compared to €84.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Trade working capital w/o retention at year end 2023 primarily
related to the component business driven PHE (€44.8 million) and MCS (€9.7 million). The decrease was primarily
attributable to a reduction in RT mainly due to an increase of advance payments on projects received and a reduction in
PHE mainly due to a decrease in trade receivables and in inventories.

The increase in inventories was primarily due to the increase (€6.7 million) in KTS. The increase was offset, in
part, the other product groups, including PHE, RT and MSC.

The lower level of trade working capital w/o retention as of December 31, 2023 was driven by RT and KTS,
where high advance payments were collected on major projects and which is reflected in the increase in advanced payments
& contract liabilities of €234.7 million at year end 2023 (increase of €89.7 million compared to year end 2022). The increase
was primarily driven by the higher activity at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022.

For the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect trade working capital w/o retention to increase due to growth
and expected stage of completion of larger projects.

_December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021_

As of December 31, 2022, our trade working capital w/o retention amounted to €84.2 million, a decrease of €28.2
million compared to €112.4 million as of December 31, 2021. Trade working capital w/o retention at year end 2022
primarily related to the component business driven PHE (€74.0 million), RT (€19.5 million) and MCS (€17.8 million),
whereas the trade working capital w/o retention of the project business-oriented KTS had negative trade working capital
w/o retention (€15.3 million). The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in KTS due to high advance payments
on projects received and an increase in trade receivables.

The increase in inventories (€11.0 million) was primarily attributable to an increase in KTS and was offset, in
part, by a decrease in PHE.

The decrease in trade working capital w/o retention as of December 31, 2022 was driven by KTS, where high
advance payments were collected on major projects mainly in the US, which is also reflected in the higher advance
payments of €145.0 million at year end 2022 (increase of €59.3 million compared to the prior year). This increase, together
with the higher overall level of accounts payables (increase of €14.1 million), which was mainly driven by the described
higher activity at the end of 2022 compared to 2021.

**Capital Expenditures**

We define capital expenditures as payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in our
consolidated statement of cash flows.

For the year ending December 31, 2024, we have budgeted approximately €45 million of capital expenditures,
including for investments in manufacturing improvement, new Green Tech solutions as well as upgrades to our enterprise
resource program software to SAP S/4 Hana and excluding any capital expenditures in connection with the planned EMEA
production footprint alignment program. For the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be
slightly above historical levels and thereafter to normalize in line with the historic average.

_Three Months ended March 31, 2024 compared to Three Months ended March 31, 2023_

Capital expenditure amounted to €8.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (2023: €11.6 million).
The majority of capital expenditure (€6.5 million) related to growth projects, such as investments in internationalization.
Capital expenditures related to maintenance amounted to €2.2 million and included replacement of equipment and
machinery.

In terms of capital expenditures by product group/segment the largest spend was in KTS for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 (€4.7 million; 2023: €7.2 million), followed by RT (€1.8 million; 2023: €1.2 million), PHE (€1.2
million; 2023: €2.0 million) and MCS (€0.6 million; 2023: €0.5 million). The capital expenditure for Divestment, Holding
and consolidation amounted to €0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (2023: €0.7 million).

**Contingent Liabilities and Other Financial Obligations**

**_Contingent Liabilities_**

As of December 31, 2023, we had a recognized contingent liability relating to the Existing Notes which amounts
to €17,787 thousand (December 31, 2022: €26,412 thousand). This contingent liability was recognized via purchase price
allocation and is amortized over the remaining lifetime of the Existing Notes using the effective interest rate method.

Several of our companies have issued or instructed the issuance of bank guarantees in favor of customers or
lenders. These bank guarantees are not considered to be contingent liabilities because these guarantees are linked to a
performance obligation to be rendered by us.

**_Other Financial Obligations_**

As of December 31, 2023, other financial obligations related to purchase commitments and bank guarantees.
Purchase commitments as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 can be broken down as follows:

**As of December 31,**

**2021** **2022** **2023**

(December 31, 2022: €157.7 million). The majority of bank guarantees was outstanding under the Existing L/G Facility
(€124.9 million as of December 31, 2023).

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of March 31, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to a variety of markets risks, including currency risks, credit
risk and liquidity risk. We monitor and manage these risks as part of our overall risk management. The following section
briefly describes the significant market risks to which we are exposed. This description does not address other risks to
which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business, such as operational risks. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Currency Risk_**

We have significant assets and liabilities outside the Eurozone, particularly in China, USA, South Africa, Brazil,
India, Poland, Czech Republic and Great Britain. These assets and liabilities are denominated in local currency. When the
net asset values are converted into Euro, the currency fluctuations result in period to period changes in those net asset
values. Our equity position reflects these changes in net asset values.

We also have transactional currency exposures which arise mostly from sales or purchases in currencies other
than the functional currency. In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations for the operating
business, all companies are required to economically hedge foreign currency items, as they arise in order to fix prices on
the basis of hedging rates. Currency risks are economically hedged for recognized assets and liabilities, unrecognized firm
commitments, and highly probable forecasted transactions, when denominated in another currency than the functional
currency of the company. The hedging periods are determined by the maturity of the economical hedged items and are
usually up to twelve months, but may also exceed that period significantly in exceptional cases.

Hedge accounting in the sense of IFRS 9 is not applied. All economic hedging transactions – to the extent legally
permissible – are handled by our group treasury department. Our companies report their exposures to group treasury, which
enters on behalf of the respective companies into corresponding derivative transactions with banks. The economical
hedging transactions are closely monitored by group treasury.

For additional information, see Note 5.10 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparties may default on their contractual obligations resulting in a financial
loss to us. In general, we have adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient
collateral in the form of advanced payments where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from
defaults.

We monitor the exposure and the credit ratings of our existing and potential counterparties continuously.
Companies active in the component business use credit limits to assess their counterparty default risk, whereas a maximum
risk limit is defined for each party. In most cases, this limit is derived from recognized credit rating agencies and credit
default swaps if available. Appropriate action is taken if the individual limit is exceeded. Companies active in the project
business ascertain the financial standing of potential customers on a case-by-case basis using all available financial
information. Before a project order is accepted, the assessment is additionally reviewed under internal risk procedures. In
the case of export transactions, confirmed and unconfirmed letters of credit are used alongside sureties, guarantees, and
cover notes, including from export credit agencies.

-----

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across different industries and regions. Hence,
there is no concentration of risk. Valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks.

Derivative financial instruments are concluded only with financial institutions with high credit-ratings assigned
by international credit-rating agencies so as to reduce the credit risk involved.

We do not have any critical credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having
similar characteristics. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with
high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and also typically are our lenders. Therefore, the credit
quality of financial assets which are neither past due nor impaired is assessed to be good. The maximum exposure to credit
risk of financial assets is the carrying amount.

For additional information, see Note 5.10 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

We are exposed to liquidity risk which may mean that it may be unable to meet payment obligations because it
has insufficient cash funds at its disposal. To manage our short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity requirements
the management has established an appropriate liquidity risk control framework consisting _inter alia of a multi-year_
financial plan and a rolling month-by-month cash forecast. We manage the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves,
banking facilities, and reserve borrowing facilities as well as by monitoring forecasted cash flows at regular intervals.

The cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity. In order to optimize borrowing
and the use of our cash funds, cash pools in various countries are established. The cash pools automatically balance the
accounts of the participating companies every day by crediting or debiting a target account. This prevents separate cash
investments and borrowings by these companies to a large extent.

For additional information on credit lines and guarantees, see Note 8.2 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of sales revenues and expenses during the relevant period. Although such estimates and assumptions are based on
management’s best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results ultimately may differ from those
estimates and assumptions. The section below presents accounting policies which require management to make judgments
and certain assumptions as the underlying facts are of uncertain nature. As a result, any changes in these facts or
assumptions may affect the results presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets_**

The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the use of
estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing, and amount of the impairment. Impairment is based on a
large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the heat exchanger
industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence,
discontinuance of services, current replacement costs, prices paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in
circumstances, which indicate that an impairment exists. The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the
estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to
make significant judgements concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows,
applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values.

The carrying amounts of intangible assets, items of property, plant and equipment, and groups of cash-generating
units with goodwill are reviewed if they are likely to have been impaired by events or changes in circumstances. In addition,
indefinite-lived intangible assets and cash-generating units with goodwill are tested for impairment at least once a year.
The impairment test compares the asset’s carrying amount against its recoverable amount (“impairment test”). The
recoverable amount is defined as the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs of disposal (net realizable
value). An estimate of fair value less costs to sell is only required if the value in use is less than the carrying amount. If the
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognized. In this
case, the impairment loss is first deducted from the goodwill of the cash-generating unit with goodwill. Any amount
exceeding goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non-current non-financial assets.

Fair value less costs of disposal is generally the benchmark for measuring the impairment of product groups
classified as “held for sale”. The valuations of other intangible assets, which were performed as part of the impairment test,

80


-----

are based on management assumptions. Previously recognized impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the
impairment no longer apply, except in the case of goodwill. Impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the
amortized historical cost.

**_Leases_**

We use estimates and judgements that affect the determination of the lease term – e.g., determining the enforceable
period and whether a lessee is reasonably certain either to exercise a renewal option or not to exercise a termination option.
We determine the lease term at the commencement date. As a lessee, we are required to reassess the lease term on the
occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and directly affects whether it is
reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise) an option included in the original contract. Both lessees and lessors revise
the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period. This requires ongoing monitoring and increases financial
statement volatility. Lease payments are discontinued at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readily be determined.
Otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate, which is mainly applied, is
based on the risk adjusted interest rates and determined for the respective lease terms and currencies.

**_Impairment_**

We recognize loss allowances for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) on financial assets measured at amortized cost,
debt investments measured at FVOCI and contract assets. We measure loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime
ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month (a) ECLs debt securities that are determined to have low
credit risk at the reporting date; (b) and other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default
occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss
allowances for trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal
to lifetime ECLs. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and when estimating ECLs, we consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available
without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on our
historical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information. We assume that the credit
risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.

At each reporting date, we assess whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI
are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes
the following observable data: (a) significant financial difficulty of the debtor or it is probable that the debtor will enter
bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted
from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss
and is recognized in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when we have no reasonable
expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.

**_Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and income tax uncertainties_**

We operate in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to different tax jurisdictions. Calculating tax
liabilities requires management to make various estimates. Management believes that it has made a reasonable estimate of
tax uncertainties. However, no assurance can be given that the actual outcome of these uncertainties will correspond to the
estimates made. Any deviations may have an impact on the level of tax liabilities or deferred taxes in the year of the
decision. When assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management judges the extent to which realization of
the deferred tax assets is sufficiently likely. The question of whether the deferred tax assets can actually be realized depends
on whether sufficient future taxable income can be generated against which the temporary differences or tax loss
carryforwards can be offset. Management therefore analyses the times at which the deferred tax liabilities reverse, and
expected future taxable income. Management forecasts whether deferred tax assets can be realized on the basis of expected
future taxable income. Deferred tax assets decline if the estimate of planned taxable income decreases, tax benefits available
as a result of tax strategies are reduced, or the amount or timing of future tax benefits is restricted by changes in law. For
additional information, see Note 6.7 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Recognition and calculation of construction contracts_**

Identification and definition of performance obligation, as well as timing of revenue recognition are based on
management’s estimates. Further, the recognition of construction contracts using the percentage of completion method is
based on management’s estimates of the cost to complete the contracts. Changes in estimates or differences between the
estimated cost and the actual cost to complete have a direct effect on recognized earnings from construction contracts. The
operating units continuously review the estimates and adjust them if required.

81


-----

**_Obligations under pension plans_**

The present value of pension obligations depends on actuarial assumptions. These assumptions comprise discount
rates, expected wage and salary increases, as well as the pension growth rate and mortality rates. These assumptions can
differ significantly from actual future outcomes as a result of changes in market and economic conditions, and can therefore
have a material effect on the level of the obligation and the related expenses.

The discount rate of the net carrying amount is calculated at the end of each year. This is the rate used to calculate
the present value of future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the obligation. In order to calculate the discount
rate, we use the interest rate on high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are
paid and whose terms to maturity correspond to those of the pension obligations. For additional information, see Note 5.4.1
of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Litigation_**

In some cases, our companies are parties to litigation. The outcome of this litigation could have a material effect
on our net assets, financial position, and results of operations. Management regularly analyses current information on these
legal disputes and recognizes provisions for probable obligations including legal costs. Both internal counsels and external
lawyers make this assessment. When deciding on the need to recognize provisions, management takes into account the
probability of an unfavorable outcome and its ability to estimate the amount of the obligation with sufficient reliability.

**_Determination of fair value of financial instruments_**

The level of management judgement, required in establishing the fair value of financial instruments for which
there is a quoted price in an active market, is usually minimal. Similarly, there is little subjectivity or judgement required
for instruments valued using valuation models which are standard across the industry and where all input parameters are
quoted in active markets (e.g., for foreign exchange rate derivatives). The level of subjectivity and degree of management
judgement required is more significant for those instruments valued using models and techniques where some or all of the
parameter inputs are less or not observable. Management judgement is required in the selection and application of
appropriate parameters, assumptions and modelling techniques. This applies especially in establishing the fair value of the
embedded derivatives.

**INDUSTRY**

**Introduction to the Heat Exchanger Industry: Heat Exchanger Types**

A heat exchanger is a device used for heat transfer from one medium to another, without mixing the two media.
Heat exchangers are used across a broad range of applications, including data centers, heating, ventilation, air conditioning
(“HVAC”), power & energy, oil & gas, food & beverages, chemicals, transportation and heavy & light industry and other
vertical markets. An important commercial feature of heat exchangers is that they typically represent only a small portion
of the machinery and equipment cost but have a high-value impact as they are important in maintaining optimal
temperatures for industrial processes. For example, heat exchangers prevent machines from overheating, which could result
in significant and costly downtime in production processes. Heat exchangers are also vital for maintaining the reliability,
efficiency, and longevity of data center operations. They ensure that servers remain cool and perform optimally. Heat
exchangers typically use either a liquid medium, where water or another liquid is used to cool or heat the fluid flowing
through, or air media, where air is used as the cooling or heating medium. Examples of liquid cooled heat exchangers
include shell and tube heat exchangers and plate heat exchangers, while examples of air-cooled heat exchangers include air
fin coolers, radiators, and condensers. Heat exchangers frequently need to operate in difficult environments, including a
broad range of temperatures (from -200 °C to +900 °C) and pressures (from -1 bar to +800 bar), as well as needing to be
resistant to corrosion, fouling and scaling. Because of this range of requirements, heat exchangers are technologically
advanced products that require sophisticated engineering capabilities. The key parameters which differentiate heat
exchangers are temperature and flow of heat, which are in turn determined by the material characteristics such as thermal
conductivity, density, specific heat, fluid viscosity, fluid velocity and surface emissivity, as well as gas characteristics.

From a technology perspective, there are four basic types of heat exchangers/heat removal devices: shell and tube
heat exchangers, plate heat exchangers, air-cooled heat exchangers and cooling towers.

_Shell and tube heat exchangers consist of a pressure vessel known as a “shell,” with a bundle of tubes inside of_
it. One fluid runs through the tubes, while another flows over the tubes within the shell, to transfer heat between the two
fluids. Shell and tube heat exchangers are widely used because of the high flexibility in allowing for a broad range of
pressures and temperatures. The key applications for shell and tube heat exchangers include power generation, food and
beverage, waste heat recovery, desalination, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, petrochemical, and marine applications.

_Plate heat exchangers consist of a frame that holds together several metal plates that are either sealed by gaskets_
or brazed or welded together. Hot and cold fluids enter the heat exchanger via separate ports, and flow in the alternate
channels that are formed by a pair of plates. The key advantage offered by plate heat exchangers is that the fluids are spread
out over the plates and therefore exposed to a larger surface area, which facilitates the transfer of heat. Plate heat exchangers
have a wide range of applications, including Data Centers, HVAC, food and beverages, Pharmaceutical and Biotech, Dairy
Industry, Chemical processing, Renewable Energy systems, industrial processes, refrigeration, oil and gas applications and
district heating and cooling.

In an air-cooled heat exchanger, a pressure vessel is used that cools a circulating fluid within a finned tube by
forcing ambient air over the exterior of the tubes. Air-cooled heat exchangers are favored in some applications because
they eliminate the need for a continuous water supply, reduce environmental impact, and provide reliable cooling in a wide
range of operating conditions. They are useful in remote locations or arid regions where water resources are limited. Key
applications broadly include Data Centers, Power generation, Petrochemical and Chemical Processing, Renewable Energy,
HVAC, refrigeration (for food and beverages), power, oil and gas, and Marine applications.

_Cooling towers are heat removal devices used to transfer unnecessary heat from process media to the atmosphere,_
using either the principle of evaporative cooling (wet cooling towers) or a closed-circuit cooling tower where there is no
direct contact between the process media and cooling air (dry cooling towers). Their ability to dissipate large amounts of
heat makes them a critical component in many cooling applications. Cooling towers are used for Data Centers, Renewable
Energy systems, power applications and, to some extent, other process applications such as chemicals and petrochemical
processing, oil and gas and district cooling systems.

The choice for a particular type of heat exchanger depends on the type of application and the characteristics of the
site (e.g., dry cooling is particularly relevant in arid areas, where water is scarce) and has a direct impact on the operational
cost of the application. While shell and tube exchangers currently represent the largest product segment in the global market
for heat exchangers and are popular owing to their flexibility and application in a wide range of environments characterized
by different pressures and temperatures, the segment for plate heat exchangers is presently growing rapidly, in part because
of energy efficiency concerns.

**Development of the Global Heat Exchanger Market**

The Frost & Sullivan Report on Global Heat Exchanger Growth Opportunities published in May 2023 estimates
that the size of the global heat exchanger market in 2022 was U.S.$14.3 billion and is expected to grow at compounded
annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 6.4% CAGR globally between 2022 and 2027.

The following chart shows the development of heat exchanger demand (in U.S.$) until 2027:

_Source: Frost & Sullivan Report_

**Market and Industry Characteristics**

The global heat exchanger market is primarily driven by the following trends and features:

**_Demand for heat exchangers supported by mega trends_**

_Strong demand for data centers_

A data center comprises extremely sensitive electronic components that require a consistent temperature,
humidity, airflow, and cleanliness to prevent equipment failure. The strong growth in data centers is driven by several key
factors such as: (1) the emergence and popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) based applications, (2) increased demand of
cloud storage, (3) remote working and distant learning, (4) rise of data intensive technologies like machine learning (ML),
internet of things (IoT) and (5) increasing digitalization of businesses and processes. This has led to a need for advanced
processors that have high heat dissipation and require more power which in turn has resulted in a shift away from the
traditional data center architecture to the adoption of advanced, more efficient cooling solutions such as adiabatic cooling,
immersion cooling, economizer, or free cooling. Technology company’s increased investment in data centers is driving the
construction and development of hyperscale data centers globally. While, at the same time, global data protection regimes
are driving the development of local data center clusters, leading to regional data center demands.

_Heat recovery for new living quarters_

Heat exchangers play a crucial role in HVAC systems by transferring heat between two or more fluids, typically
air and a refrigerant, without mixing them. In the developed economies such as Europe and USA, strong regulatory
initiatives requiring clean energy equipment to replace fossil fuel boilers in new buildings are driving demand for HVAC
/ heat pumps. In emerging economies, growing population, raising levels of disposable income, and increasing living
standards coupled with global surface temperature rises in tandem with greenhouse gas concentrations are giving rise to
increasing demand to preserve an ambient environment in a building, leading to growing demand for HVAC systems.

_Increasing environmental awareness_

With the growing push for energy transition, several new industries are emerging out of the traditional industrial
applications such as renewable energy, hydrogen economy, fuel cells, carbon capture utilization and storage (“CCUS”),
among others. The global energy transition market is expected to grow driven by increasing regulatory standards,
environmental awareness, and continuous investments to shift the energy mix to more sustainable options. Heat exchangers

play a crucial role in power plants across the value chain in maintaining optimum operating conditions from generation to
storage to distribution. By 2030, cumulative investments in energy are expected to reach U.S.$44 trillion, of which, 80%
i.e., U.S.$35 trillion will be towards transition technologies prioritizing efficiency, electrification, grid expansion and
flexibility (source: IRENA March 2023).

_Industrialization worldwide_

In the post-pandemic world, industrial development is increasingly shaped by digitalization and automation of
industrial production, a shift of global economic towards Asia and efforts to make industrial production more sustainable.
Energy-efficient equipment in energy-intensive vertical markets such as chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers, food
and beverages processing plants, the oil and gas industry and the marine industry are key drivers for demand for heat
exchangers. New, energy-saving applications for heat exchangers, such as waste heat recovery systems, have become
increasingly important. The requirement by end-customers for products that reduce costs and limit environmental emissions
necessitates technological improvements.

_Shift towards intelligent service_

The shift towards intelligent services for heat exchanger applications refers to the integration of advanced
technologies and digital solutions to enhance the monitoring, maintenance and overall performance of heat exchangers.
This includes remote monitoring and diagnostics, predictive maintenance, condition-based monitoring, remote control and
optimization, digital twin technology, integration with enterprise systems. The aim is to leverage digitalization and
automation technologies to enhance operational efficiency, reliability, and sustainability while reducing the lifecycle costs
and enhancing customer value. As the demand for efficiency increases in a more environmentally aware world, these
intelligent services become more important.

**Market Development by Region**

In terms of geographical markets and as per definitions of the Frost & Sullivan Report, Asia Pacific is the largest
regional market for heat exchangers, followed by Europe, and North America. While Europe and North America are
characterized as a mature market, Asia Pacific has shown rapid growth in the past few years. The last years have witnessed
a shift in demand from developed to emerging markets, and thus emerging countries and regions such as Asia Pacific, Latin
America and the Middle East are expected to grow substantially on the back of growing population, rapid urbanization,
increased industrialization and growing digitalization.

**_Asia Pacific_**

The Frost & Sullivan Report estimates that the Asia Pacific global heat exchanger market size was U.S.$4.7 billion
in 2022, making it the largest regional market globally, and is expected to grow at CAGR of 7.7% between 2022 and 2027.
This compares to a 2020 market size for Asia Pacific of U.S.$4.2 billion, implying a CAGR of 5.9% between 2020 and
2022. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, chemicals are the largest vertical market segment by far in Asia Pacific
followed by power generation.

The growing demand for heat exchangers in Asia Pacific is due to rapid urbanization, construction activities,
increasing capital expenditure by industrial companies, and strong consumer demand underpinned by population growth.
Asia Pacific is expected to emerge as the top chemical producer globally and emerging economies such as China and India
are expected to emerge as two of the top three countries in the power generation sector worldwide (source: Frost & Sullivan
Report). Additionally, constant investments in a range of industry vertical markets, such as the chemical and power
generation industries, are expected to boost demand for heat exchangers.

**_Europe_**

The Frost & Sullivan Report estimates that the European global heat exchanger market size was U.S.$4.6 billion
in 2022, making it the second largest regional market globally, and is expected to grow at CAGR of 6.5% between 2022
and 2027. This compares to a 2020 market size of U.S.$4.0 billion, implying a CAGR of approximately 6.9% between
2020 and 2022. Europe will remain a major heat exchanger market. Heat exchanger adoption is likely to increase due to
stringent requirements being implemented by EU government to reduce emissions.

**_North America_**

The Frost & Sullivan Report estimates that the North American heat exchanger market size was U.S.$3.7 billion
in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% between 2022 and 2027, compared to a 2020 market size of U.S.$3.4
billion, implying a CAGR of 4.6% between 2020 and 2022. Power generation is the largest vertical market for heat
exchangers in North America followed by chemicals, oil & gas, HVAC & refrigeration and data centers. Expanding refinery
capacity and new chemical plant installations are expected to drive the North American heat exchanger market. North
America’s continually increasing energy consumption supported by the power generation industry, which relies largely on

85


-----

heat exchangers, is expected to expand substantially. The installation of surface heat exchangers to update existing power
plants and reduce carbon emissions is also expected to contribute to the growing demand for heat exchangers.

**_Latin America_**

The Frost & Sullivan Report estimates that the Latin American heat exchanger market size was U.S.$0.4 billion
in 2022 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% between 2022 and 2027 compared to a 2020 market size of U.S.$0.38
billion, implying a CAGR of 2.9% between 2020 and 2022. Primary applications for heat exchangers in Latin America are
in-vehicle radiators, air conditioning systems, and sewage treatment facilities. An increasing number of heat exchangers
being refurbished at conventional power stations, refineries, and chemical processing plants is expected to be a key factor
driving growth in the Latin American market for heat exchangers. A growing population, raising levels of disposable
income, and shifting living standards leading to increased demand for passenger vehicle and installation of HVAC systems
in residential areas are also expected to have a positive impact on demand for heat exchangers in this market.

**_Middle East and Africa_**

The Frost & Sullivan Report estimates that the Middle East and Africa heat exchanger market size was U.S.$1.0
billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2022 and 2027 compared to a 2020 market size of
U.S.$0.9 billion, implying a CAGR of 4.3% between 2020 and 2022. Oil & Gas is the largest vertical market in Middle East
and Africa for heat exchangers followed by chemicals, food & beverage, and power generation. Recent industry decline in
Oil & Gas is expected to impact the growth of the market, however Middle East and Africa is also the largest market for
commercial and residential centralized cooling systems, which is expected to drive heat exchanger market growth.

**Heat Exchanger Demand in Key Strategic Pillars**

Heat exchangers are used in processes across a diverse range of industries. The major vertical markets for the
global heat exchanger are the following: chemical (25%), power generation (22%), oil and gas (16%), HVAC and
refrigeration (9%), data centers (8%), food and beverages (8%) and other industries (source: Frost & Sullivan Report).
The major vertical markets for the Company follow a different split than that of the general market and can be categorized
as mainly as High Tech, Green Tech, and Conventional sectors. The following is a description of the specific applications
of our offering within each vertical market, as well as growth expectations and certain key drivers of each vertical market.

**_High Tech_**

The High Tech sector is defined as comprising primarily of Data Centers (Hyperscalers, Colocation, Modular etc).
As per the Frost & Sullivan Report, global Data Center heat exchange demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.8%
between 2022 and 2027. APAC is expected to witness the highest growth in the data center cooling market as data center
installation ramps up and requires higher cooling due to the region’s hot climate. North America is the second-largest
market followed by Europe. The types of heat exchangers used for data center are plate heat exchangers, liquid, or aircooled heat exchangers, adiabatic coolers, direct liquid / immersion cooler, economizer / free cooler. As processing power
of the Data Centers increase and artificial intelligence / machine learning systems gain momentum, the cooling requirement
of Data Centers are expected to increase. Along with air-cooled and chilled water solutions, data center operators are
expected to increasingly deploy liquid cooling to increase efficiency of cooling solutions and reduce operational
expenditure. North America is the leader in deploying advanced cooling solutions such as liquid coolers, adiabatic cooling,
and economizer.

Vertical market applications include, white space cooling, either air based (CRAC, CRAH) or liquid based (Direct
to Chip, Immersion Cooling, Edge Cooling), heat rejection and recovery, utility cooling and backup generator cooling.

**_Green Tech_**

The Green Tech sector is defined as comprising of HVAC, Carbon Capture Storage (CCS), Hydrogen economy
and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). This sector focuses on those application practices, processes and products aimed at
minimizing environmental impact and promoting conservation of resources. It encompasses a wider range of technologies
and solutions that strive to directly or indirectly address environmental challenges such as climate change, pollution,
resource depletion and ecosystem degradation.

_HVAC & Refrigeration_

The HVAC industry is growing, driven by rapid expansion in commercial and residential building development
projects and purchases, worldwide. In developing economies, increasing urbanization and industrialization have created
demand for more HVAC-equipped enterprises and residential complexes. Energy efficiency is now required for new
HVAC installations. Governments globally have implemented legislation to encourage the use of HVAC systems that
satisfy industry standards for energy efficiency. The global heat exchanger demand from HVAC and refrigeration
applications is expected to grow at CAGR of 5.9% from 2022 to 2027 as per the Frost & Sullivan Report.

86


-----

_Carbon Capture Storage (CCS)_

CCS is an engineered system of technologies, refined over several decades, in the process of mitigating CO2
emissions from large point sources such as power plants, refineries and other industrial facilities, or the removal of existing
CO2 from the atmosphere. Captive markets, where the producer of CO2 is also the consumer, such as in chemical production
or natural gas processing for enhanced oil recovery, account for the majority of global carbon capture activity. The United
States are the largest CCS market followed by Europe and APAC. Carbon capture is an increasing focus for all companies
to leverage their competitive advantage in an emerging industry. Heat exchangers are essential in CCS processes for their
role in energy efficiency, thermal processing, thereby reducing operational costs, and also forms a significant part of the
investment in CCS projects.

_Hydrogen economy_

Hydrogen economy is an umbrella term used to denote hydrogen’s role alongside low-carbon electricity to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases. It represents a significant growth market with diverse applications across various sectors
such as heavy industry, long-haul transport, and long-term energy storage. This diversity of applications provides a wide
range of opportunities. Currently, most hydrogen is produced from natural gas. Investment in technologies for producing
green hydrogen (from renewable energy sources) and blue hydrogen (from natural gas with carbon capture and storage)
could yield significant returns as these technologies mature and scale up. The growth of the hydrogen economy is driven
by growing demand for cleaner fuel, coupled with increasing governmental regulations for desulphurization of petroleum
products. Heat exchangers are an essential part of hydrogen generation as the technology / electrolysis process of generation
of hydrogen is an exothermal process. Plate Heat Exchangers and Air Fin Coolers are typically used for this purpose.

_Liquified Natural Gas (LNG)_

LNG is natural gas that has been cooled down to -162 °C to transform it into a liquid, making it easier and safer
to transport. Natural gas primarily is methane and, when burned, releases water vapor and CO2. With emissions at 30-50%
less than from other combustible sources, natural gas is regarded as the cleanest of the fossil fuels. LNG is considered as
bridge fuel which can make energy transition easier. Fuel switching, primarily from fossil to LNG can reduce CO2
emissions and air pollutions. In the backdrop of recent geo-political situation and Europe’s quest to reduce dependency on
Russian gas supply, LNG prices have risen sharply. Increased prices spurred a high level of new supply expected from
2024 to 2028. 193 million tons per annum nameplate capacity is expected to be added by 2028, which would represent
40% of the current capacity, implying 9% CAGR supply growth between 2024 and 2028. (source: IEEFA Report). Heat
exchangers are used along the whole value chain of LNG starting from extraction, treatment, liquification, transportation,
regasification and end use (power generation, gas boilers, hydrogen production).

**_Conventional Sectors_**

Conventional sectors are defined as comprising of oil & gas, chemicals, power and energy, food & beverage,
transportation, and heavy & light industry.

_Chemicals_

As per the Frost & Sullivan Report, the chemical industry was the largest consumer of heat exchangers globally
in 2022 contributing 25% of the heat exchanger demand and heat exchanger demand from this sector is expected to grow
at a CAGR of 7.2% between 2022 and 2027. As more oil and gas businesses diversify into chemicals and petrochemicals
to create new demand for oil and gas goods, the demand for heat exchangers is expected to continue to remain steady for
this sector. China is the largest chemicals market accounting for approx. 60% of the APAC market, as per the Frost &
Sullivan Report. Heat transfer is an energy-intensive phase in many chemical processes and not prioritizing efficiency
might therefore result in inflated costs. The most popular kind of heat exchangers used in the chemical processing sector
are Shell-and-Tube units because of their adaptability and capacity to handle fluids with various levels of particles. As a
result, the chemical sector drives significant demand for Shell-and-Tube heat exchangers as it is capable of confining
substances.

_Power Generation_

As per the Frost & Sullivan Report, the power generation industry was the second largest end-market for heat
exchangers globally in 2022, contributing 22% of the heat exchanger demand and heat exchanger demand from this sector
is expected to grow at CAGR of 5.9% between 2022 and 2027. Population rises driving electricity generation contributing
to growth of the heat exchanger market in the power generation industry. Europe is focused extensively on renewables,
and North America and APAC are constructing additional thermal power plants to maintain a continuous increase in power
generation capacity. The top three power generation countries are the United States, China, and India, with each spending
extensively in thermal and dependable power. China and India are two of the fastest growing markets for heat exchangers

for the power generation sector, with heavy investment in coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants to satisfy the
predicted rise in energy demand.

_Oil & Gas_

As per the Frost & Sullivan Report, the oil & gas industry was the third largest consumer of heat exchangers
globally in 2022 contributing 16% of the heat exchanger demand and heat exchanger demand from this sector is expected
to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% between 2022 and 2027. The upstream, midstream, and downstream segments of the oil and
gas industry all have a need for heat exchangers. Oil refiners can help to optimize energy use and reduce emissions by
combining efficient heat transfer technologies with process and application expertise. Up until it is burned, crude oil could
be heated significantly by using welded-plate heat exchangers, which could result in significant operational expenditure
reductions. Demand for heat exchangers in the oil and gas sector will rebound from the downturn during the forecast period
because of increasing exploration and production activity globally.

_Food & beverage_

As per the Frost & Sullivan Report, the food and beverage industry contributed to 8% demand for heat exchangers
in 2022 and heat exchanger demand from this sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.6% between 2022 and 2027. In
the food and beverage sector, heat exchangers help reduce or eliminate microorganisms, which enhances product safety
and shelf life. A heat exchanger may be used to warm or cool goods prior to procedures including filling, drying, and
concentrating. For food processing techniques such as pasteurization and sterilization, heat exchangers are essential to
maintain specific ambient temperature and humidity. The viscosity and particle size of the product determine the kind of
heat exchanger used in this sector. The plate Heat Exchanger, used to move fluids swiftly, is the most used heat exchanger.
Global food trends influence heat exchanger innovation in numerous ways.

_Transportation, Heavy & Light Equipment_

This segment is not covered specifically in the Frost & Sullivan report as there is some crossover in other sectors
in their analysis. However, we split out this market segment to focus on heat exchangers applied in different types of
Transportation, Heavy and Light Equipment. Land transportation covers Rail, Road and Off-Road, as well as water
transportation (e.g. Marine and Shipping). Heavy and Light Equipment heat exchangers are applied for example in heavy
industry for production of large and heavy equipment, heavy machinery, coal, steel and other metals etc., and in light
industry for production of light equipment, industrial cooling, paper, textile and other consumer goods. This segment is
often characterized by direct end user relationships or OEM customers. The market dynamics are driven by growth in
infrastructure projects, global manufacturing growth, energy efficiency requirements driven by global sustainability drive
and general GDP growth Competition.

**Competition**

The competitive landscape in the heat exchanger industry is fragmented and varies significantly depending on the
specific technology (shell and tube, plate, finned tube, cooling tower), business model (project, component), vertical market
and geography. Depending on the region and the type of heat exchanger, we compete with both large international as well
as with numerous smaller regional and local competitors. The service business is primarily local. According to the Frost &
Sullivan Report, European manufacturers are the largest participants in the global market owing to large domestic markets
and domestic strength, although a large number of small competitors compete in most regional markets. The Frost &
Sullivan Report sees cost-effective manufacturers from the Asia Pacific region creating price pressures in the European
market. Key competitive factors are customer proximity, engineering competence and cost competitiveness, and customer
relationship. Rising raw material prices and a price sensitive customer base are resulting in thinner profit margins for
manufacturers, mainly because the ability to transfer increased cost of production to customers remains limited.

The Group’s global competitors are Alfa Laval, Lu-Ve, Güntner and Modine, S&T. Alfa Laval is our main
competitor the in Plate Heat Exchanger market whereas, Lu-VE, an Italian manufacturer focusing on refrigeration
technologies and is increasingly focusing on US and China. Danfoss is also a strong player in the market. In recent years,
Lu-VE has also grown through acquisitions, for example the acquisition of Refion from Alfa Laval in 2022 to expand its
portfolio mainly in the HVAC segment.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following competitive strengths:

**_Global market leader for mission-critical solutions to transformative industries, including Data Centers, Power &_**
**_Energy, HVAC, Carbon Capture Storage and Hydrogen_**

We are a leading global provider of heat exchanger solutions (source: Frost & Sullivan Report) serving a diverse
range of transformative industries (such as Data Centers, Power & Energy, HVAC, Carbon Capture Storage, and
Hydrogen), and vertical markets with a broad and differentiated product portfolio. We are also among the top three global
providers (based on our Order Intake in the addressable market, as of 2022) and the only company that can provide the full
spectrum of solutions across all vertical markets globally. Our leading market position is supported by our comprehensive
geographical footprint with operations in 24 countries (comprising 22 production facilities, 33 service centers and 19
engineering centers as of March 31, 2024) as well as our diverse product offering across a broad range of heat exchanger
products, which differentiates us from our competitors. Our solutions and products are often mission-critical to our clients’
operations because they are necessary to ensure the efficiency and safety of our clients’ operations while they only represent
a relatively small portion of the overall cost. Transformative Industries support the exponential growth of digital data by
providing the infrastructure for data storage, processing, and management of digital data. Innovations in cooling and energy
efficiency are transforming this sector. Power & Energy includes renewable sources, smart grids and energy storage
solutions. Advances in these areas are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a more sustainable energy
framework. Innovations in HVAC systems are enhancing energy efficiency, comfort in residential, commercial and
industrial buildings. Smart HVAC technologies and sustainable practices are at the forefront of this transformation. The
Carbon Capture Storage industry focuses on technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from industrial
processes and power generation, helping to mitigate climate change. Lastly, the Hydrogen industry is developing
technologies for producing, storing, and utilizing hydrogen as a clean energy source. Hydrogen has the potential to play a
significant role in decarbonizing transportation, industry and power generation.

As part of our High Five program, we focus on vertical markets within the strategic pillars High Tech and Green
Tech. These strategic pillars present a significant market opportunity to us which is forecast to grow significantly until
2027. We estimate that the total addressable market for heat exchangers in the vertical markets comprising our High Tech
and Green Tech pillars amounted to €2.4 billion and €1.1 billion in 2022, respectively (source: Frost & Sullivan Report,
MarketsandMarkets Report, Third Party Report and internal company assessments). These vertical markets are also
forecast to have the most attractive growth rates, expanding at a CAGR of 8% and 20%, respectively, between 2022 and
2027. During the same period, we reduced our exposure to Oil & Gas, Chemicals and Power & Energy from 37% of our
Order Intake for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 29% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

Our decentralized model of local production, near our customers, helps us maintain our leading positions in our
core geographic regions. Our ability to provide a one-stop shop product approach combined with our service offering is
increasingly valued by customers. Compared to smaller, regionally focused peers, we believe we have a better
understanding of technical, health, safety and environmental regulation standards globally and locally. Combined with our
scale and logistical strength to carry out large projects which are generally command improved margins. We believe that
this differentiated product and service offering has been instrumental for recent contract wins from key customers. For
example, we were awarded an order from a leading US-based bitcoin mining platform for adiabatic hybrid coolers. We
developed a customized solution focusing on water and energy consumption. As a result, our cooling solution required
70% less water and 25% less energy than existing models, which also aligns well with our own long-term sustainability
goals. Another example is an order from a US-based hyperscaler in the Data Center vertical market. Through measures,
such as joint technology workshops with the customer, material optimization and a design-to-cost approach, we believe we
were able to reduce the material requirements for our heat exchanger solutions by approximately 10% compared to existing
models. Our global scale also underpins the strength of our brand, which places us well to continue to strengthen our
positions in these fast growing and transformative end-markets segments and vertical markets.

**_Well-positioned to benefit from long-term sustainable secular megatrends, such as increasing environmental awareness_**
**_and the changes triggered by energy transition, along with the growth of digitalization_**

We believe we are strategically well-positioned to benefit from underlying megatrends across our strategic pillars
and vertical markets. The key pillars and vertical markets we serve are characterized by underlying growth supported by
long-term sustainable trends.

For example, the High Tech market, which accounted for 39% of our Order Intake for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024, is projected to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2022 to 2027 due to strong and growing demand for data
centers. The Green Tech market, which accounted for 7% of our Order Intake for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024,
is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% between 2022 to 2027 based on an increasing focus on energy efficiency and
environmental awareness, which, in turn, is driving regulatory changes aimed at climate protection and heat recovery for
residential and commercial buildings as well as for industrial applications (source: Frost & Sullivan Report,
MarketsandMarkets Report, Third Party Report and internal company assessments).

Similar global trends and the (re)-industrialization in Conventional markets underpin the growth outlook across a
range of industries, with the services business also being transformed by a shift to, and higher demand for, high-proximity
and intelligent services.

**_Difficult to replicate business model, underpinned by differentiated engineering solutions, service capabilities and_**
**_customer responsiveness_**

We believe our differentiated technical offerings and service capabilities are difficult to replicate and,
consequently, create high barriers to entry and prevent new competitors from easily entering our markets. Our application
engineering expertise and production know-how are based on decades of experience and supported by our network of 19
engineering centers and more than 450 engineers worldwide. Our innovation portfolio includes hybrid coolers for High
Tech, our advanced diffusion bonded heat exchanger “K°Bond” used in oil rigs, LNG, regasification facilities and CO2
stations, natural refrigerants, high pressure laser welded cassette (HPL) for Green Tech and hydrogen leakage testing for
Services. In particular, our advanced manufacturing technologies, including 3D design and simulation, help to improve
product performance and reduce failure rates. In addition, computational fluid design and simulation is validated by our
inhouse labs and supports the development of our thermal design know-how and proprietary software, which enables us to
design solutions according to customer requirements.

Our differentiated technical solutions are complemented by our strong Service offering and proximity to our
customers, including the ability to provide local service to global customers based on our presence in 24 countries and the
ability to service other third-party brands. This is backed by performance agreements, aimed at maximizing customers’
return on investment and predictive maintenance to reduce operational downtime. We have a full-service portfolio spanning
start-up (safe delivery, installation and early start post installation support), inspection and maintenance (period checks),
repairs and overhauls, testing and monitoring (understanding condition of equipment), spare parts (designed to match the
original parts), upgrades and replacements (for outdated components) and consulting and training (leading to competency
of client personnel). We believe the breadth of our portfolio of Services offers customers seamless operation across the
globe.

The responsiveness to our customers, and our close working relationship build trust in our solutions and delivery.
This builds long-term partnerships and trust fostering reliability as evidenced by the high proportion of our 19,000 active
customers (i.e., customers that have placed an order with us in the last 24 months) that have placed repeat orders over

multiple years. We are of the opinion that these long-term partnerships are another factor that makes our business model
difficult to replicate.

**_Highly diversified revenue stream across geographies and vertical markets ensuring stable growth and operational_**
**_flexibility_**

The combination of our global footprint, comprehensive product portfolio and range of vertical markets we serve
provides us with a well-diversified income stream. We serve approximately ten vertical markets and have operations in 24
countries. This allows us to realize growth opportunities from higher demand in individual sectors or regions, for example
in the Data Center vertical market where revenue contribution increased by 88% in the year ended December 31, 2023
(compared to the year ended December 31, 2022). We also believe this helps us better withstand adverse changes and
developments in a particular market or sector. The charts below show our revenue, by vertical market and by geography,
for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(1) Based on customer country

**_High revenue visibility from strong Order Intake and Order Backlog development_**

Our Order Intake and Order Backlog provide us with high revenue visibility, and we believe the strong
development in our Order Intake and Order Backlog will support our future performance and continued growth. From 2021
to 2023, Order Intake increased at a CAGR of approximately 24%, from €1,099 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, to €1,698 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 and Order Backlog increased from €615 million as of
December 31, 2021 to €1,103 million as of December 31, 2023. Over the same period, our revenue increased from €931.7
million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €1,347.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a
consistent ratio of Order Intake to revenue of more than 1.0x (“book-to-bill ratio”) across the periods. Moreover, for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our book-to-bill-ratio amounted to 1.1x. Revenue visibility is further enhanced by
the fact that, historically, a majority of our Order Intake in any given year was converted into revenue in the same fiscal
year or the next succeeding year. The portion of our Order Intake in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023
that was or is planned to be converted into revenue in the same year or the next succeeding year represented 51% and 54%
of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2023 as well as 62% of our budgeted revenue for the year
ending December 31, 2024. We believe that our high revenue visibility also helps drive our profitability as it allows for
improved management of customer order fulfilment, efficient operations planning and hence limits impacts under
absorption.

Our diversified presence across geographic regions and vertical markets enables us to benefit from increasing
demand in specific regions and vertical markets without being overly dependent on any single region or vertical market.
Order Intake for the year ended December 31, 2023, included €860 million in KTS, €388 million in RT, €258 million in
PHE and €210 million in MCS, driven to a significant extent by strong growth in KTS.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, Order Intake was led by High Tech, followed by Conventional and
with Green Tech and Service broadly equal. Americas and EMEA dominated the regions and APAC has been steadily
growing.

93


-----

The increase in Order Intake has been driven primarily by high demand for data center applications (particularly
in the United States due to hyperscalers) and HVAC applications (driven by catch-up in China). The growth has also been
attributable to large projects, including a carbon capture project in North America (approximately U.S. $118 million in
contract value) and an Oil & Gas project in Brazil (approximately U.S.$ 62 million in contract value).

**_Consistent and sustained progress in implementation of operational excellence plan will further enhance profitability_**
**_development_**

We have a strong track record of successfully implementing operational excellence measures across our
businesses to enhance profitability. These include initiatives to drive revenue growth, such as pricing adjustments and
production capacity realignments to increase and optimize production capacity to grow with our customers. To strengthen
our position, we are also refocusing our innovation pipeline to consistently introduce new products on a global scale. They
also include measures focused on our cost position, such as numerous supply chain initiatives across our supply chain on
a global scale (with 74 identified measures completed within 2024), production capacity utilization measures (including
production re-organization) and evaluating product mix to identify and focus on most profitable products and customer
demand. In addition, beginning in 2022, we initiated a range of actions and measures to systematically improve our cash
position by focusing on working capital. These included, among others, regular forecasting and active monitoring of cash
management and cash conversion cycles, enhancements of enterprise resource planning systems to better track inventory
levels and reduce slow-moving materials as well as actively managing receivables through initiating standard customer
debt collection policies. As a result, we reduced trade working capital w/o retention from 12.1% of revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to 1.1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Over the same period, we managed
to increase our Free Cash Flow Conversion rate from 57.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 61.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2023.

Over the last three years, we have set several measures to improve our operational efficiency (e.g. quality cost
improvements from inward quality review and improvements in internal processes) and commercial efficiency. Our
commercial efficiency focuses on the core areas (i) target selling (e.g. focus on vertical markets), (ii) process simplification
(e.g. sales order review) and (iii) digitalization. The chart below illustrates the impact of the above mentioned measures on
our Normalized EBITDA between the year ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024:

nEBITDA = Normalized EBITDA

expand our presence in these vertical markets by developing new solutions and applications, enhancing our customer
relationships, and pursuing selective acquisitions that complement our portfolio and geographic footprint.

**_Continue to grow our Service business_**

We intend to leverage our large installed product and customer base to continue to grow our Service business. For
example, we are focused on improving the organizational setup of our Service business across our product groups by
establishing dedicated service responsibilities and pooling service skills across product groups in certain regions and
increasing transparency. In KTS, we are considering strategic cooperations with specialist service providers to drive our
service business coverage and support our strategic objectives to benefit from robust growth in our strategic pillars and
vertical markets. This way we can utilize our product and engineering knowledge with a technical service partner who has
a strong market foothold that we can leverage.

**_Increase market share in the Americas and APAC region_**

We intend to continue to focus on the growth of our global platform and improve our market share in the Americas
and APAC regions through investment in production capacity and local dedicated sales teams. For example, we aim to
leverage our scale to further penetrate existing markets and strengthen our positions in China, India and the United States,
by capitalizing on strong and growing demand in our Data Center business in the Americas as well as in our HVAC and
Carbon Capture Storage solutions in Green Tech market applications. In RT and MCS, we intend to increase production
capacity and optimize production locations in the United States as well as build up a dedicated sales team for the
Transportation market. In the APAC region, we plan to continue to focus on product localization in the region and investing
in our sales and distribution networks.

**_Continue to reduce complexity and focus on digitalization to drive operational excellence_**

We continue to pursue our strategy of operational excellence by reducing complexity and enhancing digitalization
across our functional and business areas. This means focusing on activities like “80/20” where we seek to improve the
profitability of our product range, optimizing SAP in key locations, reducing process complexity through digital tools such
as Tagetik (our financial consolidation tool) and SAP (our core ERP). We also continue to deploy tools such as Power BI
to help us, for example, manage inventory reduction and improve our supply chain management globally. In addition, we
are exploring the use of Artificial Intelligence to support our sales and engineering processes, along with implementing
SAP CPQ and LO-VC. We continue to focus on the optimization of our operational footprint, especially in EMEA region,
and ensure we are manufacturing the right products in the right place for cost optimization and customer requirements.

**History**

The origin of our heat exchangers business dates back to the foundation of the company Gesellschaft für
Entstaubungs-Anlagen (“GEA”) by Otto Happel in 1920. Since then, we have manufactured and marketed our products in
various markets, supplying customers, by means of our global sales, service and production network, in highly diverse
sectors in more than 130 countries worldwide: energy; data center, chemical industries; marine applications; HVAC and
refrigeration; environmental applications, as well as the food and beverage industries. In 1999, GEA was acquired by mg
technologies AG (the successor of Metallgesellschaft AG) and was renamed GEA Group AG in 2005. In 2014, the GEA
heat exchangers segment was acquired by Triton and formally split off from the GEA Group and, in 2015, rebranded under
the name Kelvion. In 2019, the Issuer and Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. (“Mangrove LuxCo IV”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer, were incorporated and Mangrove LuxCo IV acquired Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg,
which held 100% of the shares in Kelvion Finance GmbH and all of its subsidiaries (together, the “Kelvion Group”) and
in ENEXIO Management GmbH and all of its subsidiaries (together, the “ENEXIO Group”). The acquisition included a
recapitalization of Galapagos Holdings S.A. and Galapagos S.A., which were the holding companies of the Kelvion Group
and the ENEXIO Group at that time. Following the recapitalization, the ENEXIO business was wound down, with disposals
of ENEXIO Hungary (2020), ENEXIO Service (2021), ENEXIO Water (2022) and the joint venture in India (2023).

In the first quarter of 2022, the project business of the Group (Kelvion Thermal Solutions) was carved out to a
separate subgroup of legal entities in connection with a potential sale. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the
sales process has been stopped. Management is now focusing on re-integration that may lead to certain advantages, e.g.
via sharing of best practices.

**Product Groups**

Our business operations are divided into four product groups: Refrigeration Technologies (“RT”), Machine
Cooling Systems (“MCS”), Plate Heat Exchangers (“PHE”) and Kelvion Thermal Solutions (“KTS”).

Each of our product groups primarily manages their own manufacturing and core business processes from logistics
through to production and sales. However, the product groups share, to a certain extent R&D, manufacturing and testing
facilities, as well as the support of various centralized Group functions, such as finance, human resources, IT and legal and
compliance. Each of the product groups sells to both third-party customers and to other product groups.

**_Refrigeration Technologies (RT)_**

The RT unit focuses on component business for HVAC and refrigeration applications and Data Center solutions
with significant growth potential. RT supplies a wide range of standard and customized heat exchangers for cooling and
removing heat from different types of data centers (hyperscale, colocation, modular etc.) using both air and liquid cooling
methods. The Data Center vertical market consists of cooling solutions such as air conditioning, chilling units, economizer
systems, liquid cooling systems, control systems and includes services such as consulting, installation & deployment and
maintenance and support. Our product offering includes air-cooled condensers which reject heat from refrigeration systems
and are often sold as part of a package of equipment with air coolers. RT’s customized air coolers are design-to-order units
for industrial or OEM solutions for food processing and distribution facilities. Our product offering also includes
customized radiators and dry coolers which are mainly used for power and industrial applications. Improving the energy
efficiency of commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment is essential for end users looking to reduce carbon footprint
and operating costs.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, RT generated 20.5% of our revenue and 19.8% of our EBITDA,
respectively. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the total Order Intake and Order Backlog for RT amounted
to €388.4 million and €240.9 million, respectively.

**_Machine Cooling Systems (MCS)_**

Through our MCS unit, we provide heat exchangers for power generation, power transmission, large engine
applications (marine and off-highway) and green applications such as biomass, green hydrogen, or renewable energies.
The business is mostly with OEM, e.g., for large engine manufacturers. However, we also engage in smaller projects, such
as solar, wind or solar photovoltaic. Our product offering includes charge air coolers, which cool down combustion-air
coming from the turbocharger before entering the engine. MCS’ shell and tube double safety heat exchangers assure the
secure handling of safety-critical media. It further includes box coolers which are fitted in the sea chest of small and
medium-sized vessels.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, MCS generated 14.3% of our revenue and 28.5% of our EBITDA,
respectively. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the total Order Intake and Order Backlog for MCS amounted
to €209.7 million and €92.5 million, respectively.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, PHE generated 17.9% of our revenue and 11.8% of our EBITDA,
respectively. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the total Order Intake and Order Backlog for PHE amounted
to €258.0 million and €121.6 million, respectively.

**_Kelvion Thermal Solutions (KTS)_**

KTS’ focus is our project business for demanding applications in the Oil & Gas and Chemicals vertical markets
and, similar to the RT unit, with significant growth potential in high tech data center business as well as green tech
applications such as hydrogen and Carbon Capture Storage (“CCS”) solutions. The engineering expertise of KTS plays a
key role in our differentiation against competitors. We benefit from a high degree of geographical diversification with sites
in all key regions, including Europe, NAFTA, Latin America, China and MEA. Our product offering includes air fin coolers
typically used for very large cooling requirements in different industries, _e.g., Oil & Gas and Chemicals, as well as air_
dryers which are used to remove humidity from an air stream in various process industries. Our focus in this product group
has shifted in recent years under the High Five strategy away from traditional Oil & Gas to High Tech and Green Tech
vertical markets.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, KTS accounted for 44.6% of our revenue and 58.0% of our
EBITDA, respectively. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, Order Intake and Order Backlog for KTS
amounted to €860.1 million and €659.2 million, respectively.

**Services**

All of our product groups’ activities are complemented by a comprehensive after-sales support and services
offering. We provide services both for our own products as well as for third-party products. A predictive maintenance
approach to our service solutions forms one of the five strategic pillars for our operations. This enables us to tap into the
megatrend of a shift towards intelligent service solutions, with recent technological developments enabling smarter and
more proactive solutions and customers placing increasing value on full-service packages as a means of streamlining their
operating costs. Our service offering is not a discrete business division which we run separately from our four product
groups, because it is managed on a centralized and global basis across our product groups.

Our network of 33 service centers worldwide offers our customers availability at their location at all times. We
are continually optimizing our range of services, which include precise installation work, in-house or on-site trouble
shooting, visual inspection and performance audit as part of proactive maintenance, repair and cleaning, tube replacement,
provision of spare parts, and the chemical cleaning of product components in our own service workshops. We provide
support and assistance to our customers throughout the entire product life cycle, with a view to avoiding unscheduled
downtime due to equipment malfunctions, preventing unnecessary capex investments through equipment upgrades,
replacement of parts and regular maintenance, increasing process efficiency by ensuring optimal performance of heat
exchangers integrated within those processes, helping our customers manage and service the often varied brands (i.e., other
than our own products) they use in their operations and ensuring the proper level of skill within our customers’ own
maintenance organizations through the provision of training programs designed to ensure the competency and efficiency
of their in-house maintenance personnel. Our focus is on applying our expertise and innovation to optimally ensure the
quality, safety and efficiency of our products and our service packages, and thereby establish relationships of trust to secure
long-term partnerships with our customers.

**Competition**

The heat exchanger market is fragmented, and we are among the few global suppliers. The competitive landscape
varies significantly depending on the specific technology (shell and tube, plate, finned tube, cooling tower), business model
(project, component), end-market and geography. Depending on the region and the type of heat exchanger, we compete
with both large international and smaller regional and local competitors. We believe that our services business primarily
faces competition from local players and we currently do not expect increased competition from low cost countries.

In RT, our primary competitors include LU-VE Group, Güntner and Modine.

In MCS, our primary competitors are Modine and Vestas.

-----

In PHE, our primary competitors include Alfa Laval, Danfoss and SWEP.

In KTS, our primary competitors include SPX, Evaptech, TAS and Verdon in the high tech market, Alfa Laval,
SNT Energy and CHART in the green market and SNT Energy and CHART in the Oil & Gas market.

**Customers**

Our products and solutions span the High Tech, Green Tech and Conventional market segments across a variety
of industries, sectors and regions. Our large base of customers operates in numerous vertical markets, including Data
Centers, HVAC, Power & Energy, Oil & Gas, Transportation and Food & Beverage. Our customer base comprises more
than 19,000 active customers (i.e., customers that have placed an order with us in the last 24 months) and repeat orders
over multiple years from more than 12,000 customers. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest customers
generated approximately 46% of our Order Intake (year ended December 31, 2022: approximately 32%), with the largest
customer generating approximately 25% of Order Intake in the year ended December 31, 2023 (year ended December 31,
2022: approximately 20%). Other than our largest customer, no single customer represented more than 5% of our Order
Intake in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Furthermore, our largest customer generated approximately 18%
of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023. The strength of this partnership is further demonstrated through the
significant capex investment we made, supported by this customer by funding approximately €10 million of capital
investments, through an earlier receipt of a higher milestone payment, which enabled us to increase capacity in one of our
manufacturing plants.

The primary vertical markets for RT are Data Centers, HVAC and refrigeration.

The vertical markets for MCS primarily include Chemicals, Electric Power Generation and Distribution,
Transportation and Heavy & Light Equipment.

The end-markets for PHE primarily include HVAC and refrigeration, Food & Beverage and Electric Power
Generation and distribution.

The end-markets for KTS are Data Centers, Power and Oil & Gas.

**Suppliers and Procurement**

We purchase goods and services locally from a few hundred suppliers across all regions in which we are active
and have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers. The primary raw materials used for the manufacture of our
products are steel, copper, aluminum and titanium. We typically seek to have multiple suppliers (usually two or three) for
key materials and components and believe that we are not dependent on any single supplier. In the year ended December
31, 2023, our ten largest suppliers by supplier spend represented approximately 28% of our total supplier spend.

Our procurement department function is embedded within our supply chain management (“SCM”) organization.
It is managed centrally in line with our overarching strategy and operates at the regional/entity level, reflecting our global
matrix organization. This approach is supported by a commodity management model spanning our entire SCM
organization, with a view to standardizing our collaborations with suppliers while enabling us to benefit from the
opportunities of a global supply base, for example through pooling purchasing volumes, expertise and technical knowledge.

With the exception of the individual specific procurement contracts between individual Group companies and
with their respective suppliers, we coordinate the strategic procurement for our operational product groups centrally in
order to increase our purchasing power. The most important material groups are managed by a designated commodity
manager and representatives of such Group companies for which the commodity is particularly relevant. The main task of
this commodity team is to develop and implement commodity-specific procurement strategies. The team negotiates prices
and volumes with selected suppliers in accordance with the chosen procurement strategy. In addition, local purchasing
employees support our commodity teams by managing the relationship with our key suppliers.

Given the increasing focus on sustainability considerations at the global level, on the one hand, and the broad
array of materials we procure and the number of suppliers we have from various countries, on the other hand, our SCM
function faces challenges in its efforts to harmonize systems and processes that reflect both global and local/regional ESG
requirements. In order to manage these challenges, we have defined ESG requirements for our suppliers on the basis of the
UN Global Compact and supplemented these with country-specific elements. The verification and validation of our
suppliers’ ESG performance is conducted by means of an ESG supply chain compliance (“request for information”)
questionnaire (the “ESG Supply Chain Compliance Questionnaire”) which is shared with relevant suppliers on at least
an annual basis. The number of suppliers involved in the most recent ESG Supply Chain Compliance Questionnaire
amounted to approximately 630 and included suppliers for both direct and indirect materials and services. This allows us
to proactively address and navigate ESG concerns within our supply chain.

**Research & Development**

Our research and development efforts are directed towards innovative new products, applicable for Green Tech
and High Tech solutions and development of new product applications. New development of products goes hand in hand
with new manufacturing technologies for core processes, including Industry 4.0 and robotic technologies to respond timely
to customer needs and satisfy joint development with customers. In addition, we cooperate with several universities and
research institutions in various countries, including renowned partners such as Fraunhofer Institutes (e.g., Fraunhofer ISE,
Fraunhofer ICT), University of Kassel, Technical University of Dresden, Nuremberg Institute of Technology Georg Simon
Ohm, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Research Council for Refrigeration Technology, all in Germany, Sintef
Energy Research in Norway, the Stellenbosch University in South Africa, Politecnico di Milano in Italy and the French
government-funded technological research organization CEA (Commissariat à l’énergie atomique et aux énergies
_alternatives). These partners carry out basic and applied research for us in areas including, among others, thermodynamics_
and fluid dynamics.

As of December 31, 2023, we had more than 100 employees dedicated to R&D and 19 engineering centers around
the world. For the year ended December 31, 2023, research and development expenses amounted to €16.5 million (€14.0
million in the year ended December 31, 2022). For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, research and development
expenses amounted to €17.4 million.

**Intellectual Property**

We apply for patents in appropriate jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property, which is often the result of
our R&D activities. We currently have patents and pending patent applications in Germany and other countries. As of the
date of this Offering Memorandum, we have more than 100 patents, trademarks and design rights registered in more than
40 jurisdictions. While these patents and patent applications are important to the business, we do not believe any individual
patent is critical to our overall business. We also protect certain confidential information and know-how as trade secrets.
Furthermore, we rely on certain trademarks for our business, such as the Kelvion logo and trademark.

**Sales and Marketing**

Our regional organizational setup includes front-end sales teams in order to drive our international expansion.
Front-end sales teams are backed by global solutions engineering (application engineering) teams specializing in defined
industrial markets and providing support and application expertise with a strong focus on key accounts and industries. This
setup allows us to benefit from the advantages of having both a local presence in the markets in which we are active, such
as close contact with our customers and knowledge of local restrictions and technical specifications, and the centralized
pooling of specific market segment and application know-how. It also enables the front-end Sales teams to expand our
product offering as needed to address regional “white spots” (i.e., markets in which we do not yet have a sufficient
presence). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have approximately 650 employees working in sales related
functions.

Our Global Solutions Engineering teams, with their industry-specific focus, serve to continuously optimize
business processes such as key account coordination, technical process development and project support, thereby acting as
a bridge between the product groups and our sales teams.

Our RT, MCS, PHE and KTS are responsible for manufacturing and product line management (for example,
charge air coolers and radiators) and for implementing the reorganization of the manufacturing footprint through Group
oversight, as well as targeting cost and lead time reductions through the consolidation, standardization and modularization
of our numerous product lines. In close cooperation with the Front-End Sales and Global Solutions Engineering teams, the
product areas are also driving the development of innovative products to address future market demand.

**_Tender Process and Project Controlling_**

We follow a standardized tender evaluation process through an internal tender review and approval system
supported by a digital tender review and approval system. Our tender review and approval system is built to support an
upfront assessment of risks and commercial conditions that need to be fulfilled before we submit a binding offer, including
an in-depth analysis to understand the specific technical requirements of potential clients. Depending on the expected
contract value, different approval levels are required, with significant contracts requiring the approval of our executive
management. While we are participating in tenders, our strategy is to establish ourselves as a long-term solutions provider
being able to meet customer requirements not only on a technology level, but also in terms of scale and capacity.

In order to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in commodity and material process, we aim to freeze the most relevant
material purchases by procurement binding offers prior to providing a quote to the customer. In addition, in recent years
we have started to successfully include material price escalation clauses in contracts with our customers in order to mitigate
adverse price fluctuations.

In addition, we conduct weekly reviews to monitor our performance across our projects.

**Environmental, Safety and Governance (ESG)**

ESG considerations are a key aspect of our corporate strategy aimed at securing our future as a strong and resilient
provider of long-term value to our customers and business partners, and embodied by our “R3” approach: We aim to
**respect all employees,** **reduce unsustainable usage of resources and** **report transparently to our business partners and**
stakeholders.

As part of our efforts to combat climate change, we aim to make our operations climate neutral by 2040. By way
of a first step, we have aligned our operations and our ESG strategy, initiatives and annual targets with the 17 Sustainability
Development Goals of the United Nations, and published our first ESG report in 2023. The attainment of our CO2 reduction
targets and those of our customers calls for innovation and smart technologies – all the more reason for us to continue to
develop and promote our broad range of innovative heat exchange technologies that facilitate the conduct of sustainable
operations in various markets around the world.

As an internationally active company, we are obligated to adhere to internationally accepted conventions of a
social, political and legal nature. Responsible business practices are second nature to us, and we strive to lead by example
when it comes to our social responsibility towards our employees and society as a whole. Our ESG strategy aims to create
a responsible company culture from a diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) perspective at all company levels, and we
uphold human rights, fair working conditions, environmental protection and integrity, including anti-corruption efforts.

**_Environment_**

We attach great importance to environmental protection, climate change and energy efficiency along our entire
value and production chain – from our procurement of raw materials and our product development endeavors through our
internal manufacturing processes to our end products and servicing. With our waste reduction program and continuous
reduction of our CO2 footprint through innovation and the use of smart technologies, we intend to meet our customer
expectations of high quality and resource-efficient production and supply chain management, and to be carbon neutral by
2040. In line with our strategy, we could achieve for 2023 an increase in the consumption of energy from renewable
sources, a reduction in our direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and a reduction in the disposal of both
hazardous and non-hazardous waste.

_CO2 Footprint_

Our environmental focus is also demonstrated by our use of green energy and our energy-saving endeavors at our
plants: Since our production plant in Wuhu (China) was established in 1995, it has bundled our core competences – robust
production capabilities, extensive service offerings and deep technical expertise, backed up by the innovative strength of
our local R&D departments – to supply heat exchanger solutions to customers around the globe. The first solar panels were
installed in Wuhu in 2022 and the entire roof of the production facility is equipped with solar panels, substantially reducing
our CO2 emissions with more than 4.0 MW of green electricity generated. We believe that this initiative constitutes a strong
first step towards achieving our goal of 100% usage of green energy.

Our production site in Sint Maartensdijk, the Netherlands, halved its energy consumption, reducing CO2 emissions
from approximately 1,000 tons per year to approximately 500 tons per year, between 2021 and 2023. This was primarily
attributable to significantly lower electricity usage achieved through the implementation of a range of energy-saving
measures, such as reduction of the start-up time of machines prior to working hours, checks to ensure that machines are
not automatically switched on by timers or software at the weekends, remote measurement of individual appliances and
heating and ongoing campaigns to raise awareness among employees of energy-saving behavior among all colleagues,
including regular communication and postings on information displays, as well as an ideas box. As a next step, we are
expanding our focus to include waste heat recovery: In addition to implementing internal measures in this regard, we are
also collaborating with a network of local companies, as well as the city administration, to explore and implement further
ideas for more sustainable production. We are working with an industrial company on a project to reduce our CO2 emissions
by recovering waste heat for use in heating the production halls for our air cooler units. While our low-temperature factory
heating system is already sustainable, the use of waste heat from neighboring facilities opportunistically will reduce our
natural gas requirements and thereby enable us to reduce our carbon footprint.

**_Social_**

We believe that we set high standards for sustainable and environmentally conscious behavior, not only for
ourselves but also for our suppliers. As a matter of principle, we have a policy not to buy any materials that are associated
with the exploitation of people or with child labor, and also expect our business customers to observe these standards. We
are committed to providing a safe, healthy and also inspiring working environment with fair and respectful working
conditions for all members of our workforce. We continue to pursue our zero-accident strategy to eliminate the number of
accidents and ensure safe conditions and practices at our facilities. We fundamentally uphold diversity, equity and inclusion
(“DEI”) principles in all areas of our global operations and condemn discrimination of all kinds. These core principles are
a fixed and integral part of our HR policy, and are reflected in numerous corresponding programs worldwide, such as health
and safety at work initiatives and our Whistleblower Policy.

-----

_Safety_

We develop innovative, high-quality products and processes for our customers, and product safety is a top priority
in our business operations. Our Safety Topic of the Month (“STM”) initiative relates to a monthly publication aimed at
raising awareness among our workforce of one of a broad range of safety topics, which are of particular relevance for the
employees at our production and service facilities. The STM material is published on our intranet and on blackboards on
every production site worldwide. Each STM focuses on a specific risk and provides clear instructions for the action to be
taken to reduce said risk. In addition, a safety and risk minimization checklist is made available to those responsible for
occupational health and safety matters on site.

As part of our Health, Safety & Environment (“HSE”) program, we have defined a global baseline with a view to
improving health and safety management at all of our production sites. This involves the completion of a self-assessment
questionnaire for each of our facilities based on seven categories, such as targets, qualifications and risk assessment, with
10-15 questions each. On the basis of the scores for 2023, the following steps were identified for 2024: (i) Connection of
lower scoring sites with the high scoring sites for the categories in question; (ii) setting up internal calls for the discussion
of the specific issues; and (iii) preparation of a cross-check audits, pursuant to which the HSE Manager for one production
facility will conduct an audit of another production facility. This should help cross learning, help create standardization
and drive performance improvement. The implementation of the steps identified each year for the following year ensures
continual improvements in the scores achieved by our facilities and promotes the maintenance of a robust health and safety
culture globally: It encourages our employees to take responsibility for their own safety and that of their colleagues, to
strive to attain and follow up on HSE goals and targets, and to complete HSE qualifications and training (for staff and
supervisors). It also facilitates the identification of (occupational) HSE risks, and encourages the carrying out of regular
inspections by those responsible for health & safety at our production sites and also investigations into near misses and
actual accidents, including root cause analyses and risk assessment reviews. We have adopted a similar approach in the
areas of quality and environment.

_Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)_

DEI are core values within our organization. It is our goal to have a diverse and talented workforce that also
reflects the diversity of our stakeholders and business partners. We are committed to maintaining a diverse, equal and
inclusive corporate culture, continually implementing corresponding improvements in all of our human resources processes
to provide a working environment which is free of prejudice and in which everyone is treated equally, and to attract and
retain top talent and foster greater innovation, creativity and, at the same time, productivity. Our DEI policy sets out our
aims and commitments in this area and several initiatives are underway to increase understanding and awareness within
our organization: Further examination of our existing human resources processes, in particular recruitment and talent
management, to attract more women and individuals from diverse backgrounds to our company, mentoring and “bonding”
programs for our female employees to foster networking activity and support their professional development, for example
our K°Women’s Network and a new women-focused mentoring program launched in February 2024, and DEI training for
employees and management.

**_Governance_**

Our leadership team has established a global compliance organization, a compliance group function and local subfunctions, which are supported by regional compliance officers. The fundamental principles of compliance management
are set out in our central compliance organization directive.

Our Group code of conduct, which applies to all of our employees worldwide, provides guidance on the most
relevant compliance topics, such as environment and safety, general business conduct, antitrust and competition, anti-fraud
and anti-bribery, data protection and working conditions. It describes the values, principles and modes of action which
guide the entrepreneurial conduct of our enterprise, including internal policies and guidelines and create a work
environment characterized by integrity, respect and fair and responsible conduct.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2023, the total number of our employees amounted to 5,159 full-time equivalents (FTEs),
excluding vocational trainees and inactive employment contracts (December 31, 2022; 4,817). We believe that our
relationships with our employees are generally good. We have not suffered any material work stoppages or strikes in recent
years.

Certain of our employees are represented by works councils. Works councils have various information,
consultation and co-determination rights. For example, they must be notified in advance of any employee layoffs, must
consent to hirings and relocations of employees and are granted co-determination rights in social matters, such as work
schedules and rules of conduct. In addition, we are subject to collective bargaining agreements with employees in various
countries, including Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands.

101


-----

_Pension Liabilities_

Our employees are offered various benefit options, primarily in the form of defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans. The defined benefit pension plan obligations mainly exist in Germany. New employees are
generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions. As part of the general benefits provided,
all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their compensation. Under this arrangement, an agreed
amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of up to 100% of the deferred amount is converted into a pension
benefit. A corresponding collective bargaining agreement was entered by our predecessors in 2002 and revised in 2008.
The new pension plan beginning in January 2019 does not only provide for pension payments, but also capital payments
and installment payments.

In addition to the currently open benefit schemes, there are a number of historical pension schemes. These schemes
are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for employees who were members at the time the
benefit scheme was closed.

As of December 31, 2023, the net carrying amount of defined benefit obligations amounted to €25,416 thousand
(as of December 31, 2022: €23,439 thousand). As of the same date, the net carrying amount of unfunded obligations
amounted to €24,017 thousand (as of December 31, 2022: €22,137 thousand). For additional information on our employee
benefit obligations, see Note 5.4 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance policies for general and product liability, property damage and business interruption,
directors’ and officers’ and other insurance with coverage which we consider to be consistent with industry practice. We
consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both in terms of the nature of the risks covered and the amounts insured
for our business activities. However, our insurance coverage does not cover all potential risks associated with our business
or for which we may otherwise be liable. Consequently, we cannot guarantee that we will not suffer a loss or losses which
are not covered by our insurance policies or which may be in excess of the amount of the insurance coverage we maintain.
See “Risk Factors—Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks—Our insurance coverage could prove to be inadequate.”

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. We do not
expect that any of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will result in a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, in connection with the financial restructuring and recapitalization of Galapagos Holding S.A. and
Galapagos S.A. in 2019, a number of claims were filed against our entities in various jurisdictions. As of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, such claims either have been dismissed or decided in our favor in final and unappealable
judgements or have been irrevocably withdrawn. On October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. acquired the shares in
Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Galapagos BidCo Group”). Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., was
the shareholder of Kelvion Finance GmbH, (together with its subsidiaries, the “Kelvion Group”) and in ENEXIO
Management GmbH (together with its subsidiaries, the “ENEXIO Group”) at the acquisition date.

The acquisition was consummated by way of a distressed disposal under an English law governed intercreditor
agreement dated May 14, 2014 (the “2014 Intercreditor Agreement”) in connection with the balance sheet restructuring
transaction of Galapagos S.A. and Galapagos Holding S.A., the former direct and indirect shareholders of Galapagos BidCo
S.à r.l., which resulted in a recapitalization of the operating business of the Galapagos BidCo Group, a deleveraging of the
Galapagos BidCo Group’s balance sheet and access to new debt facilities and instruments with longer tenors (the
“Recapitalization”). In connection with the Recapitalization, the Issuer in particular issued the Existing Notes.

In connection with the Recapitalization, a holder of senior unsecured notes issued by Galapagos Holdings S.A. in
2014 (the “2014 Senior Unsecured Notes”), which had been impaired as part of the Recapitalization, filed claims against
Galapagos Holdings S.A., Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and certain Group entities in the courts of the State of New York. The
relevant holder of the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes asserted, among other things, that the sale of the Galapagos BidCo
Group violated the terms of the indenture governing the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2014 Intercreditor
Agreement and that the release of certain guarantees under the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes were invalid. In response,
Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., among other things, sought certain declaratory judgments in the English courts (which are the
competent courts for the interpretation of the 2014 Intercreditor Agreement), confirming that the sale of the shares in
Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. complied with the terms of the 2014 Intercreditor Agreement. In
July 2023, the competent English courts granted the declaratory judgments sought by Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. Following
this decision, the relevant holder of the 2014 Senior Unsecured Notes agreed to a dismissal of the claims filed in the courts
of the State of New York and the relevant proceedings are closed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

Furthermore, insolvency proceedings over Galapagos S.A. were opened in 2019 and are pending in Düsseldorf,
Germany and London, United Kingdom in connection with the Recapitalization. The German insolvency administrator
filed a number of claims before German and Luxembourg courts seeking to prevent and/or unwind the transfer of the shares
in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. on the basis that such transfer constituted a voidable action and
was fraudulent. The German clawback proceedings were finally dismissed in June 2023 and the relevant proceedings are
closed. In January 2024, the German insolvency administrator also withdrew the corresponding proceedings in
Luxembourg and the case is closed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

For additional information, see Notes 1.2, 8.3 and 11 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**REGULATION**

Our business, and in particular the operation of our production sites and marketing of products, is subject to
various regulatory requirements. Applicable laws and regulations may differ from site to site as well as markets due to
different national and local laws. The regulatory requirements relate in particular to our production processes and include,
_inter alia, laws and regulations relating to (occupational) health and safety measures for employees, the technical safety_
requirements for operating machines, the use and handling of chemicals, air emissions, soil contamination and the
management and disposal of waste, hazardous and toxic substances and other materials. For our sites and operations, we
are required to obtain and hold various permits and to comply with the requirements specified therein as well as
requirements under applicable laws, regulations and standards. We are further subject to foreign trade laws and may be
required to pay export duties or customs duties on materials and products that we export or import. We are subject to further
regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including antitrust laws and zoning and occupancy laws that
generally apply to manufacturing businesses. Further, marketing and placement activities with respect to our products and
our relationships with customers, suppliers and competitors are subject to regulatory requirements. The following is an
overview of the main laws and regulations that are relevant to our activities in Germany. Local laws and regulations that
deal with similar aspects apply in other jurisdictions in which we operate production sites or sell our products.

**Environmental Laws**

**_Air Emissions_**

We are required to comply with various environmental laws and regulations. In particular, our operations are
subject to laws and regulations designed to limit emissions. In Germany, the construction and operation of production sites
requires active permits under the Federal Emissions Protection Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, the “BimSchG”),
which encompasses various other licenses, authorizations and approvals necessary for the construction and operation of
facilities pursuant to other laws. The permits typically provide for a variety of auxiliary conditions aimed at protection of
other interests, such as neighbors and the environment. As part of our obligations under the BImSchG and supplementing
laws, regulations and standards, we are required to observe the emission standards set under the Technical Instructions on
Air Quality Control (Technische Anleitung Luft – the “TA Luft”), a revised version of which entered into force on
December 1, 2021.

In general, to the extent the respective facility operated in compliance with its legally definitive permits and
applicable laws and regulations, the operation of the facility can generally not be challenged or contested by third parties.
However, proportionate measures to mitigate any negative impact of a facility on the environment or neighbors may be
required; including, _e.g., adherence to stricter emissions thresholds. For instance, permits may be amended and_
administrative orders under the BimSchG may impose certain limitations (e.g., stricter requirements with regard to
permissible emissions or the use of the relevant facilities), with which we have to comply. To the extent certain measures
based on state-of-the-art technology are impossible or economically disproportionate to implement in light of extraordinary
costs, the regulator may grant certain privileges to the relevant facility (e.g., less strict emission thresholds than expected
with state-of-the-art technology). To the extent new legal standards are introduced, permits are dynamic and will, in general,
be adjusted so they meet the relevant new standards. Non-compliance of the operator with applicable permits, other
administrative decisions, laws, regulations or standards may also lead to a (temporary) restriction or, in severe cases, a
prohibition of further operation. The competent authority may also impose administrative fines or, in exceptional cases,
even ask for removal of the facility. Furthermore, non-compliance may result in additional administrative, civil or even
criminal liability as well as reputational damage, depending on the individual case.

**_Carbon Emissions_**

The EU ETS imposes an EU-wide emissions cap applying to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that
can be emitted by in-scope operations and provides for the trade with allowances for such emissions for certain sectors and
companies. The EU ETS was implemented in Germany with the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act
(Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz, the “TEHG”). The provisions of the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading
Act provide that the facility operators subject to emissions trading are obliged to obtain a license to emit greenhouse gases,
to comply with a cap on emission allowances allocated to them and to maintain a monitoring process to determine and
documents their emissions. For newer facilities, this permit is typically integrated into the BImSchG permit. The regulations
also provide for the possibility of trading surplus allowances on the open market. The allowances are traded in certain
trading periods, which requires certain energy and industry sectors to comply with the applicable greenhouse gas emissions
caps. Overall, only a limited number of allowances—determined in advance for the trading period—are available to
emission sources, subject to the EU ETS. Participation in this system has been mandatory since 2005 for all industries with
high energy consumption levels.

The overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been constantly reduced over the
different trading periods. Under the revised EU ETS, the EU-wide quantity of emission allowances allocated annually is
reduced by a linear factor of 4.3% per year from 2024 compared to the average annual total quantity of emission allowances

104


-----

issued in the EU between 2008 and 2012 (which equals an annual reduction of 87,924,231 allowances to be issued in the
EU) and of 4.4% as from 2028 (or 89,968,981 per year). To achieve the target of cutting EU emissions by at least 55%
compared to 1990 by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality within the EU by 2050, a further reduction of 90 million
allowances in 2024 and further 27 million allowances in 2026 will be made in accordance with Regulation (EU) No
2021/1119 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality (the “European Climate Law”). Based on this
reduction path, the total quantity of newly issued allowances will be zero in 2040. Until then, the transitional free allocation
of allowances will continue on a reduced rate. On June 5, 2023, the Directive 2023/959/EU amending the Emissions
Trading Directive 2003/87/EC (the “Emissions Trading Directive”) entered into force. According to the amended version
of the Emissions Trading Directive, the free allocation will be reduced to 0% until 2030 for most sectors, except for district
heating, which will continue to receive a free allocation of 30%. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed
their emission allowances will have to purchase a considerable and steadily increasing proportion of increasingly pricy
emission allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial additional cost for such companies. A further exemption
is available for certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation of plants to countries
with less stringent climate protection laws (“Carbon Leakage”). Since 2010, the European Commission determines every
five years which industries are threatened by Carbon Leakage. The designated industries are allocated 100% emission
allowances free of charge for the period until 2030. However, the allocation of 100% does not necessarily mean that the
allocation is in line with the demand. The product benchmarks, which determine the amount of allowances allocated free
of charge, are based on the average performance of the 10% most efficient facilities in a sector or subsector in the Union
and will decline by 0.3 to 2.5% per year, calculated from the year 2008, taking into account expected emission reductions
due to technological progress.

Some of the Carbon Leakage industry sectors may apply for financial compensation for the increase of electricity
costs due to the costs of EU ETS allowances being passed on to electricity prices. The compensation is not enforceable and
is granted from funds provided in the federal budget for that purpose for the relevant year.

**_Chemicals Legislation and Regulations_**

We use a number of chemicals and hazardous substances in our production processes and are therefore subject to
Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, as
amended from time to time (“REACH”). REACH aims to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the
environment, including the promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of substances, as well as free
movement of substances on the internal market while promoting competitiveness and innovation. REACH standardizes
chemicals legislation within Europe, placing greater responsibility on industry participants – encompassing manufacturers,
importers, downstream users and distributors – making them responsible for the safety of the substances, mixtures and
articles placed on the market of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) for industrial, professional and consumer use.
REACH sets out general rules for the marketing of substances, mixtures and articles in the EEA, and imposes various
obligations which vary according to the hazardous properties of the substances, their form, quantity and concentration, as
well as the role of the actors in the supply chain. Applicable obligations may include, e.g., the duty to register substances,
notify substances in articles to the European Chemicals Agency (the “ECHA”), duty to communicate information in the
supply chain and down to the customers, duty to comply with restrictions and/or authorization requirements.

In addition, we are subject to the provisions of the German Chemicals Act (Gesetz zum Schutz vor gefährlichen
_Stoffen—Chemikaliengesetz, the “ChemG”) and related ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen), most notably the Hazardous_
Substances Regulation (Gefahrstoffverordnung). The ChemG and supplementing regulations are intended to minimize the
risks from chemicals for humans and the environment. Based on the ChemG and related regulations, the competent
authorities have, among other things, the authority to require that certain materials or chemicals (i) may either not be
produced, marketed or used at all, (ii) may only be produced, marketed or used in a certain manner or for specific purposes,
(iii) may only be used under certain circumstances or (iv) may only be distributed to certain persons.

Regarding the transportation of dangerous goods at the international level the European Agreement concerning
the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road as of September 30, 1957 (Accord européen relative au transport
_international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route, the “ADR”) as amended on January 1, 2023 and implemented_
into German law through the Dangerous Goods Regulation for Road, Rail and Inland Navigation (Gefahrgutverordnung
_Straße, Eisenbahn und Binnenschifffahrt) includes provisions applicable to the carriage of dangerous goods on roads._
Pursuant to the ADR, dangerous goods, as a general rule, may be carried internationally in road vehicles subject to
compliance with a number of conditions, such as packaging and labeling requirements. Specific dangerous goods (e.g.,
goods which are poisonous and explosive at the same time) are excluded from carriage on the road.

**_Soil Contamination_**

Pursuant to the German Federal Soil Protection Act _(Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz, the “BBodSchG”), the_
responsibility for residual pollution and harmful changes to the soil lies with the party who caused a harmful soil change
or a contaminated site (polluter), its universal successor, the relevant property owner, the occupant of the relevant real
property and, if the title was transferred after March 1, 1999, the previous owner of the property, if they knew or must have

105


-----

known about the contamination. Under the BBodSchG, liability is not based on culpability, meaning that any of the abovementioned parties alone or together may be held liable for a contamination irrespective of any negligence or intent on their
part. Determining the party to be held liable for contamination-related measures lies in the discretion of the competent
authority. There is no predetermined statutory order in which the aforementioned parties can be required by the competent
authority to carry out remediation measures. When exercising its discretion, the competent authority takes into account the
effectiveness of remediation as a prevailing factor. Thus, the current owner of the contaminated property will generally be
held primarily liable, as he is usually in the best position to carry out the necessary remediation work. However, the party
that carried out the remediation work may be able to claim compensation from the other responsible parties irrespective of
which party is held liable by the competent local authority. Unless otherwise agreed upon, the obligation to provide
compensation under the BbodSchG, as well as the extent of such compensation, depends on the degree to which the hazard
or damage was primarily attributable to one party or the other. Liability is not based on culpability. Therefore, the
BbodSchG does not require the competent authority to prove negligence or intent on the part of the liable parties.

According to the BbodSchG the competent authority may require risk inspections, investigations, remedial
measures, including clean-up or containment, and other measures necessary for the protection of the soil and the prevention
of residual contamination or other harmful soil changes and related (ground)water contamination.

Regarding other environmental media, _e.g., (ground)water or protected natural resources, other laws, such as,_
_inter alia, the Federal Water Management Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, the “WHG”) and the Environmental Damage Act_
(Umweltschadensgesetz, the “UschadG”) provide for further contamination-related liability of, in particular, polluters and
facility operators.

**Product Regulation**

Our heat exchange products are subject to certain product regulations in the countries where they are placed on
the market.

In the EU, product regulations such as Regulation (EU) No 2023/1230 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 14 June 2023 (the “EU Machinery Regulation”) and Directive 2014/68/EU (the “EU Pressure Equipment
**Directive”), which provides for strict obligations with regard to product traceability, are relevant for our product portfolio.**
These Directives provide the regulatory basis for the harmonization of the essential health and safety requirements for
machinery and pressure equipment at EU level. As a manufacturer of heat exchangers, we must implement a conformity
assessment procedure to ensure compliance with those requirements, issue a declaration of conformity and affix the CE
marketing on the products. The EU Pressure Equipment Directive was implemented into German law by the Product Safety
Act (Produktsicherheitsgesetz, the “ProdSG”), which regulates the safety requirements for products brought to the German
market to ensure they do not present a risk to health and safety when properly installed, maintained, and used as intended.

Further, Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2012 on eco-design requirements for air conditioners and comfort
fans and Commission Regulation (EU) No 327/2011 of March 30, 2011 with regard to eco-design requirements for fans
driven by motors with an electric input power between 125 W and 500 kW apply for our products. As we are distributors
of these products our customers expect compliance with eco-design requirements as with any other applicable regulation.
Under these Regulations related to eco-design, air conditioners must, _e.g., comply with requirements related to energy_
efficiency and sound power. As we manufacture and distribute heat exchangers containing substances depleting the ozone
layer we must further comply with the respective legislation. In the EU, for instance, Regulation (EU) 2024/590 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 7 February 2024, provides for a gradual phase out of hydro-chloro-fluor-carbons
(HCFC), which are, inter alia, used in air conditioning equipment. In addition, the use of certain fluorinated greenhouse
gases in air conditioning systems of motor vehicles is gradually prohibited through Directive 2006/40/EC of May 17, 2006.
Similar restrictions may apply outside the EU in the United States implementing the Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer of September 16, 1987, as amended.

Compliance with product regulations is enforced by the authorities on a random sample basis, whistleblowing or
notifications of competitors. The authorities may investigate the facts and issue orders, in a worst case scenario sales bans,
corrective actions and product recalls.

**Product Liability**

Marketing our products we are subject to provisions on product liability and may, therefore, be held liable in cases
of damage caused by a defective product manufactured by us. In the EU, for example, Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25,
1985, as amended by Directive 1999/34/EC of May 10, 1999 (the “Product Liability Directive”) applies to movables
which have been industrially produced. It establishes the principle of objective liability (liability without fault of the
producer) in cases of damage caused by a defective product. The Directive applies to damage caused by death or by personal
injuries and damage to an item of property intended for private use or consumption, with a lower threshold of €500. The
Product Liability Directive imposes no financial cap on a producer’s liability, yet it allows EU member states to cap a
producer’s liability for damages from death or personal injury caused by identical items with the same defect at no less

106


-----

than €70 million. Furthermore, the Product Liability Directive does not bar EU member states from offering injured parties
more comprehensive or extra rights under contractual or non-contractual liability grounds.

In September 2022, the European Commission published a draft proposal to update the Product Liability Directive.
This revision aims to modernize the regulations governing product liability for the digital era, create equal conditions for
manufacturers inside and outside the EU, and enhance consumer protection by easing the proof required in liability claims.

After preliminary discussions on this proposal, a compromised draft was agreed upon on January 24, 2024. The
European Parliament officially approved the updated Product Liability Directive in March 2024. Its formal ratification by
the European Council, announcement in the Official Journal of the European Union, and subsequent implementation are
anticipated in the first half of 2024. Once in effect, member states will have 24 months to incorporate the revised directive
into their national laws. However, the new Product Liability Directive does not allow any derogations in order to achieve
a higher or lower level of protection.

In Germany, the Product Liability Directive has been transposed into national law through the enactment of the
Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz, the “ProdHaftG”).

**Occupational Health and Safety**

According to national and international provisions, we are in most jurisdictions obliged to take measures related
to health and safety at work. Knowledge of hazardous substances and associated health and safety risks are dynamic and
develop over time as the related standards do. In this context, we must, for example, perform risk assessments, maintain
registers of hazardous substances and issue working instructions to ensure the safe handling of hazardous substances and
manufacturing equipment by our employees. In general, compliance with employment safety regulations is subject to
regulatory supervision. We ensure compliance with the applicable legal requirements to protect health and safety for
humans involved in our operations. We seek to apply uniform health and safety standards across our business.

We are, in particular, subject to the Workers Protection Act (Arbeitsschutzgesetz, the “ArbSchG”) and the
German Hazardous Substances Regulation (Gefahrstoffverordnung, the “GefStoffV”). The latter in particular ensures the
safe handling and use of hazardous substances during production, and proper classification and labeling of products, and
provides comprehensive safety information to users and workers involved in maintenance and disposal activities.

**Data Privacy**

We are subject to laws across several jurisdictions regarding privacy and protection of personal data. Laws and
regulations related to data protection, privacy, cyber-security and other laws and regulations can be very stringent and vary
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These laws govern how companies collect, process, and share personal data, grant rights
to data subjects, and require that companies implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of
information.

In the European Union and the EEA, the principles on the legitimate processing of personal data are laid down in
the GDPR as well as national legislation supplementing the GDPR (such as the German Federal Data Protection Act
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, the “BDSG”). Personal data is defined broadly and includes any information related to an
identified or identifiable natural person (data subject). The GDPR implements stringent requirements obligations and
restrictions for, among other things, the collection, storage, transfer and other processing of personal data, in particular
(without limitation) for lawful processing, transparency, data subject rights, international data transfers, storage limitation,
data mapping and accountability, processor (service provider) obligations, joint controllership, notification of data breaches
and the requirement to designate a data protection officer.

The collection of personal data is confined strictly to specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and the
processing of this data must be in alignment with these purposes. Furthermore, personal data must be adequate, relevant,
and limited to the purposes for which it is processed (principle of data minimization). The processing must be carried out
in a way that guarantees transparency, fairness, and appropriate security of the personal data. As a consequence, the GDPR
requires us to inform data subjects regarding, among others, the manner in which their personal data is collected, utilized,
and processed, the legal justification for its processing, and the entities with which their personal data is shared.

In addition, the GDPR and local data protection rules provide strict requirements on the processing of sensitive
personal data (so-called special categories of personal data), like genetic and health data of individuals, including on the
implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security of this data. Accordingly, certain
cyber-security requirements must be fulfilled to ensure that data is processed and stored safely. We are required to
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the organization’s
processing requirements and risk. Organizations must notify the relevant supervisory authority about data breaches within
certain time limits and, in some instances, provide notification to data subjects.

107


-----

In general, the transfer of personal data to third counties or international organizations outside the EU/EEA is
permitted only when certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection. In relation to data transfers from the
EU/EEA to the United States, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-US Privacy Shield in
July 2023 to facilitate EU-US data transfers. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also
to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information.

The GDPR and the BDSG introduced substantial sanctions for non-compliance and, depending on the nature of
the infringed provision, may consist of civil liabilities, cease-and-desist orders from competitors, criminal sanctions and/or
administrative fines, and adverse publicity and reputational damages. Administrative fines can amount to EUR 20 million
or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual sales of the preceding year, whichever is higher, for each violation. Even the
perception of privacy concerns, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation. The occurrence of any of these risks could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to evolving EU and national privacy laws on the use of cookies, tracking technologies and emarketing practices. In the EU, informed consent is required for the placement of certain cookies that are not technically
essential for use or similar tracking technologies on an individual’s device and for direct electronic marketing. Consent is
tightly defined and includes a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to obtain separate consents for each
type of cookie or similar technology. In Germany, the use of internet tracking technologies is regulated in the German
Telecommunications Digital Services Data Protection Act (Telekommunikation-Digitale-Dienste-Datenschutz-Gesetz, the
“TDDDG”) which implements Directive 2002/58/EC (the “ePrivacy Directive”) and applies in addition to the
requirements under the GDPR.

Furthermore, based on the EU and German Data and Digital Strategies, there are several initiatives pending and
new laws passed aimed at establishing a single, uniform digital European market with robust cyber-security requirements,
including the Digital Services Act, the Data Act, the Directive EU 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities (so-called
NIS2 Directive), and the Cyber Resilience Act. In addition, the Artificial Intelligence Act that was approved by the Council
on May 21, 2024.

**German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act**

The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, the “LkSG”) requires
companies to manage certain human rights and environmental risks in their (global) supply chains by means of a cascade
of risk management measures, including, e.g., risk assessment, preventive and remediation measures as well as maintaining
a grievance mechanism/complaints procedure and reporting to the competent authority.

Since January 2024, the LkSG obligates companies with a workforce of, in principle, at least 1,000 employees in
Germany that have their headquarters, main administration, administrative headquarters, legal domicile, or a branch in
Germany to ensure that the canon of protected human rights and environmental obligations set out in the law are not
infringed and that corresponding risks are minimized and mitigated, both in their own business areas and in their wider
supply chain. The protected legal positions under the LkSG include, in particular, protection from child and forced labor,
slavery, disregard of occupational safety obligations and freedom of association, protection from discrimination and
withholding of adequate wages, protection from certain environmental pollutions, as well as land expropriation, torture and
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Companies must also consider environmental obligations from a set of three
internationally recognized agreements, namely the Minamata Convention, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic
Pollutants, and the Basel Convention. The specific content of the statutorily required systemic and dynamic corporate risk
management depends on a variety of factors, such as the nature and scope of the business (including the risks of the specific
industry and business and the type of products), as well as the company’s ability to influence the immediate cause.

All supply chain due diligence risk management is required to be on-going, as it should be carried out and/or its
effectiveness reviewed annually as well as on an ad hoc basis if the in-scope company has reason to expect a significantly
changed or significantly expanded risk situation in the supply chain, e.g., due to the introduction of new products, projects
or new business fields, or information received through the complaints procedure/grievance mechanism.

Enforcement rests with a federal authority, the BAFA, and may be initiated ex officio or by individual application
of an affected party. Should enterprises not adhere to their legal responsibilities, they could face administrative penalties.
These penalties can reach up to 2% of the enterprise’s yearly worldwide turnover. The system of fines based on revenue is
specifically applicable to enterprises generating over €400 million in annual revenue. Additionally, enterprises might be
disqualified from receiving public contracts if they are subjected to an administrative fine that exceeds a specified minimum
threshold.

**European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive**

In addition, the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament have
agreed on a joint draft of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) on December 14, 2023. The
EU Parliament adopted the CSDDD on April 24, 2024 and the Council of the EU formally adopted the CSDDD on May
24, 2024. The CSDDD still needs to be transposed into national law.

The CSDDD will affect companies of more than 1,000 employees with a turnover of more than EUR 450 million.
It aims to foster sustainable and responsible corporate behavior in companies’ operations and across their global value
chains. To this end, the directive establishes a corporate due diligence duty for companies, requiring them to identify,
prevent, mitigate, address, and account for potential and actual adverse human rights and the environment impacts in the
company’s own operations, their subsidiaries and, where related to their value chain(s), those of their business partners.
Additionally, the CSDDD obligates large companies to adopt and put into effect, through best efforts, a transition plan for
climate change mitigation aligned with the 2050 climate neutrality objective of the Paris Agreement as well as intermediate
targets under EU climate law.

Under the CSDDD, companies are expected to integrate due diligence into their policies and management systems. They
must conduct due diligence regularly, take appropriate measures to address potential and actual adverse impacts and risks,
and publicly communicate on their due diligence efforts. The CSDDD also includes provisions for enforcement and access
to legal remedies for those affected by companies’ failure to comply with their risk management and due diligence
obligations. It aims to level the playing field for businesses in the EU by ensuring that all companies adhere to the same
high standards of corporate responsibility, thereby contributing to a sustainable economy and a better future.

_which the members of the executive management of the Issuer or their close family members are able to exercise a_
_significant influence or in which they hold a significant share of the voting rights._

Related parties of the Group in accordance with IAS 24 primarily comprise the shareholders of the Issuer and our
subsidiaries.

**Transactions with shareholders**

The sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l. granted a loan of €140 million to the Issuer on October 9, 2019
during the acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group. The loan did not carry interest for the first six months after inception.
On March 9, 2020, the shareholder contributed the loan receivable into the capital contribution account of the Issuer. With
shareholder resolution as of December 22, 2020, the sole shareholder of the Issuer, Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l.
acknowledged to convert an aggregate amount of €136,528,353 into tracking preferred equity certificates. As of December
31, 2023, the tracking preferred equity certificates are recognized at €170,580,799 including an interest of €11,350,815
(2022: €11,350,815).

**Transactions with other related parties**

Other related parties are our subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. Income
and expenses from transactions with our subsidiaries and joint ventures or non-consolidated subsidiaries not included in
the consolidated financial statements mainly result from regular deliveries of goods and services.

In the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred advisory costs from a Triton related advisory company
amounting to €293 thousand (2022: €365 thousand). Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, we had financial liabilities
towards Triton Fund IV amounting to €4,172 thousand (2022: €1,343 thousand) as well as €542 thousand (2022: €542
thousand) towards Galapagos MidCo S.à r.l. and €22 thousand (2022: €22 thousand) towards Triton MasterluxCo S.à r.l.

**Share-based payments**

In 2020, certain management personnel were invited to participate in our management incentive plan (the
“Mangrove MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of Mangrove Management Invest S.C.A; an entity
which has a part-ownership of Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l., the parent company of the Issuer. In order to participate in the
Mangrove MIP, an initial cash investment was required from the management personnel, at a price not less than the fair
value of such investments.

During the year 2022, an additional management incentive plan was implemented. Again, certain management
personnel were invited to participate in a management incentive plan of the new Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group (the
“KTS MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of TESCO Management S.C.A, an entity which has a
minority stake in TES LuxCo S.à r.l. TES LuxCo S.à r.l. is the parent company of Mangrove’s product group, Kelvion
Thermal Solutions Group. Similar to the Mangrove MIP, the investment is structured in such a way that the management
personnel have taken part-ownership of a holding company via an investment vehicle. In order to participate in the KTS
MIP, in a first step the management personnel sold their contribution in the Mangrove MIP at fair value to Mangrove
LuxCo I S.à r.l. In the amount of this receivable from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l., the management personnel received an
investment in the KTS MIP. The initial cash-related investment of the management personnel (receivable from Mangrove
LuxCo I S.à r.l.) in the KTS MIP was at a price not less than the fair value of the investment in any case.

The nature of the Mangrove MIP and the KTS MIP is such that personnel management investments will only be
realized upon exit of our current shareholders, with exception of specific events (for example management personnel
leaving our employment). It is anticipated that the management personnel will participate in the management incentive
plans until such exit is achieved. The lead investor is permitted to issue further equity, and each management personnel has
the explicit right to participate further in the management incentive plans, such that their investment is not diluted.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

_Interest rates_

The interest rate on cash advances under the Cash RCF Facility will be the rate per annum equal to the aggregate
of the applicable margin and (a) in respect of Term Rate Loans, EURIBOR in relation to cash advances in euro, Term
SOFR in relation to cash advances in U.S. dollars or the applicable Term Reference Rate for cash advances in any other
currency (in each case as such term is defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement) and (b) in respect of Compounded
Rate Loans, the Compounded Reference Rate for that day for that Compounded Rate Currency (in each case as such term
is defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement) (each with a zero floor). Following the date that is the end of the
second full fiscal quarter date after the Issue Date and provided that no Material Event of Default or Compliance Certificate
Event of Default (as each such term is defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement) has occurred and is continuing,
the margin on the Cash RCF Facility will be subject to reduction if certain “senior secured net leverage ratios” (which are
to be calculated in the same way as the “Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio” under and as defined in the
Indenture for the Notes (see “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) are met.

_Commitment fees_

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Cash RCF Facility
from (and including) the Issue Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for the Cash RCF Facility cat
a rate of the applicable percentage of the then applicable margin for the Cash RCF Facility. The commitment fee will be
payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period of the Cash RCF Facility and on the date the Cash
RCF Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which a lender cancels its commitment.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the L/G RCF Facility
from (and including) the Issue Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for the L/G RCF Facility
computed at a rate set out in the relevant ancillary facility but in any event not exceeding a rate of the applicable percentage
of the applicable guarantee fee for the L/G RCF Facility. The commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the
last day of the availability period of the L/G RCF Facility and on the date the L/G RCF Facility is cancelled in full or on
the date on which a lender cancels its commitment.

The guarantee fee for letters of credit or guarantees issued under the L/G RCF Facility will be agreed with each
ancillary lender under the L/G RCF Facility on a bilateral basis. If letters of credit are cash collateralized and continue to
be provided, the guarantee fee shall be as agreed between the Company and the relevant ancillary lender. The Company or
the relevant Borrower shall also pay (or procure that payment is made) to the relevant ancillary lender under an ancillary
facility related to the L/G RCF Facility an issuance/administration fee in the amount and at the times specified in the
relevant ancillary facility agreement.

In relation to any additional Cash RCF Facility and/or additional L/G RCF Facility (the “Additional **Facility”),**
the Company shall pay (or shall procure that another Obligor shall pay) to the Agent (for the account of each relevant
Additional Facility Lender (as defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement)) a commitment fee (if any) in the amounts,
and at the times, specified in any relevant Additional Facility Notice (as defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement).

No commitment fee shall be payable unless the Issue Date occurs. The Company is not required to pay any
commitment fees to a lender for so long as such lender is a defaulting lender.

Default interest will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to being in compliance with Article 1154 of
the Luxembourg Civil Code, be calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

_Other fees_

The Company is also required to pay customary agency fees to the Agent and the Security Agent in connection
with the Super Senior Facilities.

**_Availability_**

The Cash RCF Facility may, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized from (and
including) the Issue Date to (and including) the date falling one month prior to its maturity date. The L/G RCF Facility
may, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized from (and including) the Issue Date to (and
including) the date falling one day prior to its maturity date.

115


-----

**Maturity and Repayment Requirements**

Each Super Senior Facility matures on the date falling on the earlier of (i) the date falling 4 years and six months
after the date of the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and (ii) the date falling six months prior to the Maturity Date of the
Notes.

Each advance under the Cash RCF Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto,
subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date.

All outstanding amounts under a Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the relevant
Facility.

Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Cash RCF Facility may be re-borrowed during the
availability period for that facility, subject to certain conditions.

**_Prepayment_**

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum amount and
notice requirements).

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all
amounts due to that lender upon:

  - a “change of control” (which comprises, generally, (i) the Issuer ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued
share capital or all of the voting rights of the Company and (ii) the scenarios set out under the definition of “Change
of Control” under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”); or

  - if it becomes unlawful for the lender to perform any of its obligations (as applicable) under the Super Senior
Facilities or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any Utilization (as defined in the Super Senior Facilities
Agreement).

If the Company or a restricted subsidiary has consummated an asset disposition and the net cash proceeds received
in connection therewith which exceed €35.0 million have not been applied for certain purposes specified in the Super
Senior Facilities Agreement within 360 days of the date of the receipt of such net cash proceeds, the Company shall also
mandatorily prepay any outstanding Cash RCF Facility loans in an amount equal to the pro rata share of the Cash RCF
Facility in such net cash proceeds within three business days.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any ancillary lender may, as between itself and the relevant member of the
Restricted Group, agree to continue to provide such ancillary facility (with such arrangements continuing on a bilateral
basis and not as part of, or under, the finance documents for any Facility and the transaction security for such Facility shall
not, following release by the Security Agent, secure any such ancillary facility in respect of any claims that arise after such
cancellation).

To the extent that the commitments of a lender under the Cash RCF Facility are voluntarily cancelled by the Issuer
in full which the Company is entitled to do by giving five business days’ prior written notice to the Agent of such
cancellation, such lender under the Cash RCF Facility shall have the right to cancel its commitments under the L/G RCF
Facility in full within 30 days of its commitments under the Cash RCF Facility being cancelled in full, by giving not less
than 5 Business Days’ prior notice to the Issuer and the Agent, provided that the Issuer shall have 30 days after the relevant
lender giving notice of such cancellation of the commitments under the L/G RCF Facility to the Issuer and the Agent, to
cash-collateralize, replace or provide counter-guarantees for any guarantees or letters of credit then outstanding under the
relevant ancillary facility provided under the L/G RCF Facility. This shall not apply to the extent that the commitments of
all lenders under the Cash RCF Facility are reduced prior to the Acquisition Closing Date on a pro rata basis.

**_Additional Facilities_**

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement contemplates the incurrence of uncommitted “additional revolving
facilities” and “additional guarantee facilities” in a maximum amount not to exceed the aggregate sum of:

  - in respect of the Cash RCF Facility (i) the greater of (x) €65.0 million and (y) an amount equal to 45% of
consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization plus certain adjustments, similar to those
in Consolidated EBITDA as set out in “Description of the Notes,” of the Restricted Group, on a pro forma basis
for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements are
available prior to such incurrence (after giving pro forma effect to the relevant transactions) less (ii) the total Cash

116


-----

RCF Facility commitment immediately before giving effect to the amount of the additional revolving facility; and

  - in respect of the L/G RCF Facility (i) the greater of (x) €190.0 million and (y) an amount equal to 130% of
consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization plus certain adjustments, similar to those
in Consolidated EBITDA as set out in “Description of the Notes,” of the Restricted Group, on a pro forma basis
for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements are
available prior to such incurrence (after giving pro forma effect to the relevant transactions)

_less (ii) the total L/G RCF Facility commitment immediately before giving effect to the amount of the_ additional L/G
RCF Facility,

Such additional revolving facilities and guarantee facilities may be incurred under the Super Senior Facilities
Agreement either as a new Cash RCF Facility, a new L/G RCF Facility and/or as an additional tranche of any existing Cash
RCF facility and/or L/G RCF Facility and/or by increasing the commitments under an existing Cash RCF Facility or an
existing L/G RCF Facility. Such additional revolving facilities and/or guarantee facilities will be secured and shall rank
_pari passu with the Super Senior Facilities and be prepaid on a_ _pro rata basis (including with respect to mandatory_
prepayments). The lenders of any such additional revolving facilities and/or guarantee facilities may not have the benefit
of guarantees from any member of the Restricted Group which is not a borrower or guarantor of the Super Senior Facilities
or security over assets other than the then existing transaction security for the Super Senior Facilities (except where the
same security (to the extent permitted by law) is granted in respect of the other facilities under the Super Senior Facilities).

The availability, maturity, pricing and other terms of any Additional Facility will be those agreed between the
Issuer and the relevant lenders of that Additional Facility, provided that (i) (in relation to an additional revolving facility)
the final maturity date of the additional revolving facility is no earlier than the Termination Date applicable to the Cash
RCF Facility (or, in each case, if at such time the Revolving Facility has been cancelled in full or would be repaid and
cancelled in full after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of the relevant Additional Facility, any final maturity
date under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement); and (in relation to an additional guarantee facility) the final maturity
date of the additional guarantee facility is no earlier than the Termination Date applicable to the L/G RCF Facility (or, in
each case, if at such time the L/G RCF Facility has been cancelled in full or would be repaid and cancelled in full after
giving effect to the application of the proceeds of the relevant Additional Facility, any final maturity date under the Super
Senior Facilities Agreement), (ii) no “material event of default” has occurred and is continuing at the time the relevant
Additional Facility is committed (unless the proceeds of the relevant Additional Facility are used to refinance existing
additional revolving facilities or guarantee facilities) and (iii) no member of the Restricted Group may provide an
Additional Facility.

**_Guarantees_**

The Super Senior Facilities is guaranteed by the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors and will be guaranteed by the
Post-Issue Date Guarantors within 120 days of the Issue Date.

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement requires that, subject to certain “agreed security principles” set out in the
Super Senior Facilities Agreement, each member of the Restricted Group that is, or becomes, a “material company” (which
is generally defined under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement to include, among other things, certain members of the
Restricted Group that have earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing 5% or more of the
consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the Restricted Group, and certain members of
the Restricted Group that are a direct or indirect holding company of a “material company”) after the Issue Date by
reference to the annual consolidated financial statements (the “Annual Financial Statements”) most recently delivered to
the Agent, or, at the discretion of the Company, a more recent set of financial statements of the Restricted Group for an
LTM Period; and/or if a Subsidiary has been acquired since the date as at which the latest Annual Financial Statements of
the Restricted Group were prepared, the latest annual financial statements of the relevant Subsidiary for the relevant
financial year (consolidated in the case of a Subsidiary which itself has Subsidiaries), or, if such financial statements are
not available or required by law, such other accounts as are available (commencing with the first complete fiscal year
ending after the Issue Date) will be required to become a guarantor under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement within
120 days of the date of delivery of the relevant annual consolidated or combined, as applicable, financial statements of the
Issuer for the relevant fiscal year.

Furthermore, if on the last day of each financial year of the Company (commencing with the first complete
financial year after the Acquisition Closing Date), the guarantors represent less than 80% of the consolidated earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the members of the Restricted Group (subject to certain exceptions)
(the “Guarantor Coverage Test”), within 120 days of delivery of the annual financial statements for the relevant financial
year (commencing with the first complete financial year after the Issue Date), such other members of the Restricted Group
(subject to the agreed security principles and certain other exceptions) are required to become guarantors until the Guarantor
Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on the last day of the

117


-----

relevant financial year). Members of the Restricted Group may be excluded from such calculation if (i) they are
incorporated in an Excluded Jurisdiction (as defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement) or (ii) there is a restriction
applicable to it in relation to becoming a guarantor.

The Company shall also ensure that the Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied by the date which is 120 days after
(and excluding) the Issue Date (or such later date as the Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion).

**_Security_**

The Super Senior Facilities (subject to the agreed security principles set out in the Super Senior Facilities
Agreement) are secured by the Collateral as further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Each direct and indirect holding company of any “material company” (provided that such holding company is a
wholly-owned member of the Restricted Group in each case with certain members of the Restricted Group being excluded,
which becomes a guarantor under any Facility is required (subject to the “agreed security principles”) to grant security over
the shares it holds in such material company in favor of the Security Agent. In addition, any “material company” or other
member of the Restricted Group which becomes a guarantor of the Super Senior Facilities is required (subject to the agreed
security principles) to grant security over certain of its material assets in favor of the Security Agent.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the collateral (whether or not
shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Super
Senior Facilities, as well as certain hedging obligations and cash management obligations, in priority to the Notes.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties (subject to
certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with certain
representations and warranties being repeated on the date of each utilization request made after the Issue Date and on the
first day of each interest period), including without limitation: (i) status; (ii) binding obligations; (iii) non-conflict with
other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v) validity and admissibility in evidence; (vi) consents and filings; (vii)
governing law and enforcement; (viii) no insolvency; (ix) no proceedings pending or threatened; (x) no filing or stamp
taxes; (xi) no events of default; (xii) taxation; (xiii) deduction of tax; (xiv) consents and filing; (xv) no filing and stamp

statements.

**_Covenants_**

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related definitions
(with certain adjustments) that will apply to the Notes as included under the caption “Description _of the Notes—Certain_
_Covenants.”_

In addition, the Super Senior Facilities Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, and
the Super Senior Facilities Agreement also contains a financial covenant for the benefit of lenders under the Cash RCF
Facility only. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality,
actual knowledge or other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

_Affirmative Covenants_

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information in respect of the
Restricted Group, including annual audited and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates; (ii)
authorizations; (iii) compliance with laws; (iv) payment of taxes; (v) maintenance of pari passu ranking of the Super Senior
Facilities; (vi) access for the agent; (vii) compliance with environmental permits and laws; (viii) acquisitions; (ix)
maintenance of the guarantor and security coverage; (x) further assurance provisions and (xi) compliance with sanctions
and anti-corruption laws.

_Negative Covenants_

The negative covenants include certain restrictions, among others, with respect to (i) activity by the Issuer other
than a holding company activity; (ii) changing the center of main interest of a borrower or guarantor under any Facility;
and (iii) Notes purchases. Otherwise, the negative covenants in the Super Senior Facilities are substantially the same as the
negative covenants that will be in the Indenture.

118


-----

Certain of the incurrence covenants under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement may be suspended upon (i) the
occurrence of a “Listing” (as defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement) (that does not result in a “change of
control”) and the achievement of a “consolidated net leverage ratio” of the Restricted Group is equal to or less than
2.00:1.00 (generally, _pro forma for any prepayment of the Cash RCF Facility from the proceeds of such initial public_
offering) or (ii) a member of the Restricted Group or a holding company of the Issuer having achieved an investment grade
status (Baa3/BBB- or better by Moody’s or S&P, respectively).

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement also contain a “note purchase condition” covenant, which provides, subject
to certain exceptions set out in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, that the Issuer may not, and shall procure that no
other member of the Restricted Group will, prepay, purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any of the
principal amount of the Notes prior to the scheduled repayment date. The exceptions to such covenant include, inter alia
(and provided that no event of default under any Super Senior Facility is continuing or would result from such note
purchase): (i) notes purchases funded with, _inter alia, certain permitted indebtedness under the Super Senior Facilities_
Agreement (other than the Cash RCF Facility); (ii) note purchases that do not exceed 50% of the aggregate face value of
the Notes in existence at the Issue Date or incurred afterwards (and any permitted refinancing thereof); or (iii) the Super
Senior Facilities (including any additional facilities) are cancelled (and if applicable prepaid) in the same or greater
proportion as the proportion of the note purchase to the aggregate face value of the Notes then outstanding, provided that
(A) the revolving facility commitments shall in no circumstances be required to be reduced below an amount equal to 60%
of the total revolving facility commitments outstanding at that time; and (B) the guarantee facility commitments shall in
no circumstances be required to be reduced below 80% of the total guarantee facility commitments outstanding at that time.

_Financial Covenant_

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement requires the Issuer to comply with a consolidated “senior secured net
leverage” financial covenant for the benefit of the lenders under the Cash RCF Facility and any additional revolving facility
which benefits from the financial covenant. The financial covenant will be tested quarterly on a rolling basis, generally,
subject to (i) the first test date falling on the date that is the end of the second full fiscal quarter date after the Issue Date
and (ii) the “test condition” being met on the relevant test date, such condition being (A) the aggregate of all outstanding
loans under the Cash RCF Facility and any springing covenant revolving facility and all outstanding cash drawings and
any letters of credit or guarantees which have been called and which remain outstanding under Ancillary Facilities (as
defined in the Super Senior Facilities Agreement) under the Cash RCF Facility or any springing covenant revolving facility
less cash and cash equivalents held by members of the Restricted Group as at such test date, which exceeds (B) 40% of the
aggregate of Cash RCF Facility commitments as at the date of the Super Senior Facilities Agreement and additional
revolving facilities established following the date of the Super Senior Facilities Agreement.

The Issuer is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the financial covenant by applying a “cure” amount
(generally, amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted shareholder subordinated debt),
including as if “consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization” had been reduced by such
amount. There is no requirement to apply any such cure amount in prepayment of the Super Senior Facilities. No more
than five (in aggregate) different cure amounts may be taken into account prior to the original termination date of the Super
Senior Facilities Agreement out of which no more than two may be remedied pursuant to an EBITDA cure and more than
two EBITDA or prepayment cure amounts in any four consecutive financial quarters are not permitted.

**_Events of Default_**

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement provides for some of the same events of default, with certain adjustments,
as those applicable for the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Events of Default.” In
addition, the Super Senior Facilities provides for certain customary events of default, all of which are subject to customary
materiality and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate, comprising without limitation:
(i) for the benefit of lenders under the Cash RCF Facility only, breach of the financial covenant subject to possibilities to
cure the financial covenant breach; (ii) breach of other obligations subject to a 20 business day grace period; (iii)
representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed repeated
subject to a 20 business day grace period; (iv) material litigation, arbitration or administrative, governmental, regulatory
or other proceedings in relation to the finance documents or against any member of the Restricted Group or its material
assets; (v) cross default subject to thresholds; (vi) unlawfulness and invalidity subject to a 20 business day grace period;
(vii) failure to comply with a material term of the Intercreditor Agreement by a member of the Restricted Group or any
affiliate of the Issuer which is not a member of the Restricted Group subject to a 20 business day grace period; (viii)
repudiation and rescission of the finance documents and (ix) cessation of business.

119


-----

**_Governing Law_**

The Super Senior Facilities Agreement will be governed by English law, _provided that the events of default,_
incurrence covenants and related definitions for the Notes to be included (with certain adjustments) in the Super Senior
Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of New York.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under certain of our financing arrangements, the Issuer
and the Initial Guarantors, among others, will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) on
or about the date of this Offering Memorandum together with the Agent, the Original Lenders and the Mandated Lead
Arrangers and the Security Agent, to which the Trustee will accede as a “senior secured notes trustee” on or prior to the
Issue Date.

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor
Agreement on its behalf as Trustee.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that will be contained in the
Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes. It does not restate the
Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the
description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of
the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement will prevail.

**_Overview_**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

  - The relative ranking of certain debt of the Restricted Group in respect of “Super Senior Liabilities”, “Senior
**Credit Facility Liabilities,” “Senior Subordinated Liabilities,” “Cash Management Liabilities,” “Non-**
**Priority Hedging Liabilities,” “Priority Hedging Liabilities” and “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities” (each as**
defined below);

  - the relative ranking of certain security granted by certain members of the Restricted Group and by Third Party
Security Providers for the benefit of certain creditors under certain of our financing arrangements;

  - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Restricted Group;

  - when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the “Transaction Security” (as defined below);

  - the requirement to turnover amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security and certain guarantees
provided by certain members of the Restricted Group and by Third Party Security Providers;

  - when the Transaction Security and guarantee(s) issued by certain members of the Restricted Group and by Third
Party Security Providers will be released to permit an enforcement sale;

  - the circumstances under which creditors’ claims (including the claims of holders of the Notes against the
Company) might be required to be transferred to third parties or released to assist in enforcement; and

  - the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security, certain guarantees and other
amounts received by the Security Agent.

_Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain customary provisions regulating certain additional indebtedness
permitted to be incurred by members of the Restricted Group and which is contemplated to be secured by the documents
creating security (including over the Collateral) (the “Transaction Security”) granted by certain members of the Restricted
Group and by Third Party Security Providers (together, the “Transaction Security **Documents”).**

120


-----

Such additional indebtedness may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof):

(a) be in the form of a “credit facility” ranking senior to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to the

proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of,
enforcement of Transaction Security with the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and any Hedging
Agreements in respect of the Priority Hedging Liabilities (such additional credit facilities, solely for the purposes
of this description of the Intercreditor Agreement, the “Additional Super Senior Facilities” and, the lenders of
such indebtedness, the “Additional Super Senior Lenders”): (ii) be in the form of a “credit facility” and have
equivalent rights to the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case it will
vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the Transaction Security with the same class of creditors as
the holders of Notes Liabilities (the “Senior Credit Facility Liabilities”) or (ii) to the extent that it benefits from
Transaction Security, be in the form of loans, credit or debt facilities or notes (among other things) and rank junior
to the liabilities in respect of the Notes, in which case it will share in the proceeds of enforcement of the
Transaction Security expressed to secure it on a junior basis to the holders of the Notes (such indebtedness,
“Senior Subordinated Debt,” and the lenders or holders of such indebtedness, the “Senior Subordinated
**Creditors”).**

_Hedging Transactions_

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions that will permit certain members of the Group to enter into
hedging agreements with certain hedge counterparties, which may also be secured by the Transaction Security.

The hedging agreements may either, with respect to the Transaction Security (and the proceeds thereof): (i) be
secured on a senior basis to the liabilities in respect of the Notes with respect to the proceeds of enforcement of the
Transaction Security, in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the Transaction Security
with the lenders and creditors under the Super Senior Facilities (such hedge counterparties, the “Priority Hedge
**Counterparties”); or (ii) have equivalent rights to the rights of the holders of the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement,**
in which case it will vote in, and share in the proceeds of, enforcement of the Transaction Security with the same class of
creditors as the holders of Notes and the holders of any Future Pari Passu Debt (such hedge counterparties, the “Non**Priority Hedge Counterparties” and, together with the Priority Hedge Counterparties, the “Hedge Counterparties”).**

_Intra-Group Debt and Shareholder Debt_

None of the Issuer, any of its restricted subsidiaries or any shareholder of a member of the Restricted Group which
is not otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of any of the “Super Senior Creditors” (as defined
below), “Senior Secured Creditors” (as defined below) or the Senior Subordinated Creditors or (2) the debt documents
thereby secured, will be party to the Intercreditor Agreement save for: (i) any shareholder of the Issuer (or affiliate of the
Issuer which is not a member of the Restricted Group) in respect of any existing or future loan made to the Issuer or any
of its restricted subsidiaries (each a “Shareholder **Creditor,” and each such loan, the “Shareholder Liabilities”); and (ii)**
certain members of the Restricted Group that lend (each an “Intra-Group Lender”) to other members of the Restricted
Group and each debtor under such loan or any other entity which accedes or otherwise becomes a party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a debtor and/or creditor, that will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the loans or
indebtedness owing from such member of the Restricted Group to such other member of the Restricted Group in respect
of intra-group loans which are in an aggregate amount of €10.0 million or more and which are or will be outstanding for
more than 12 months (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”) (each an “Obligor” and, together, the “Obligors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain subordination provisions relating to any Intra-Group Liabilities as well
as the Shareholder Liabilities. However, Obligors will not be prohibited from making payments in respect of any IntraGroup Liabilities until an “acceleration event” has occurred and is continuing under any of the Indenture, any Senior Credit
Facility, any Super Senior Debt or any Senior Subordinated Debt.

_Security Agent_

There will be a single security agent appointed to act at all times on behalf of (i) the lenders under the Original
Super Senior Facilities and any Additional Super Senior Lender (together, the “Super Senior Lenders”), any Priority
Hedge Counterparties, any Cash Management Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and any Additional
Super Senior Lenders (together, the “Super Senior Creditors”), (ii) the Senior Creditors, any Non-Priority Hedge
Counterparties and any Senior Secured Notes Creditors (collectively, the “Senior Secured Creditors”) and (iii) any Senior
Subordinated Creditors (and together with the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors, the “Primary
**Creditors”).**

121


-----

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the
Senior Credit Facilities (the “Senior Credit Facility Liabilities”), the Notes and any additional notes issued from time to
time under the Indenture (together, the “Senior Secured Notes,” and the liabilities in respect thereof, the “Senior Secured
**Notes Liabilities”), the amounts owing to the Cash Management Providers (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (the**
“Cash Management Liabilities”), the amounts owing to the Priority Hedge Counterparties under the Hedging Agreements
(the “Priority Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the Cash Management Liabilities and the Super Senior Debt
Liabilities, the “Super Senior Liabilities”) and the amounts owing to the Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties under the
Hedging Agreements (the “Non-Priority Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the Priority Hedging Liabilities, the
“Hedging Liabilities”), certain customary costs and expenses of the Trustee (the “Senior Secured Notes Liabilities”),
amounts owing to the Security Agent, and amounts owing to the Creditor Representatives (the “Creditor Representative
**Liabilities”), will rank equally (without preference among them) in right and priority of payment and in priority to the**
liabilities of the Obligors, as the case may be, in respect of the Senior Subordinated Debt (the “Senior Subordinated
**Liabilities”), the Intra-Group Liabilities (except as otherwise set out under “—Intra-Group Liabilities and Shareholder**
_Liabilities” below) and the Shareholder Liabilities._

The Senior Subordinated Debt will rank in priority to the Intra-Group Liabilities owed to the Issuer and, following
the Control Date, the members of the Group and the Shareholder Liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement will not rank any liabilities and/or obligations owed to any person who is not the
Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the Issuer.

_Priority of Transaction Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement shall provide that the Transaction Security created pursuant to the Transaction
Security Documents shall rank and secure the following liabilities in the following order (but only, in each case, to the
extent that such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities):

   - **first,** _pari passu_ between themselves and without any preference between them, the Super Senior Liabilities, the
Priority Hedging Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Senior Credit Facility Liabilities, the Cash
Management Liabilities, certain customary costs and expenses of the Trustee and the Non-Priority Hedging
Liabilities; and

   - **second,** _pari passu_ between themselves and without any preference between them, the Senior Subordinated
Liabilities.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security are to be applied as described below under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall.”

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Shareholder Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement shall provide that the Intra-Group Liabilities owed to the Issuer and, following the
Control Date, the members of the Group and the Shareholder Liabilities are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities
owed by the Obligors to the Primary Creditors. Prior to the Control Date, the Intra-Group Liabilities owed to members of
the Group are subordinated to the Super Senior Liabilities of the Group only.

**_Restrictions on Payments_**

_Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement shall provide that the Obligors may make payments in respect of the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and Senior Credit Facility liabilities, respectively, at any time in accordance
with their respective terms.

122


-----

_Cash Management Providers_

The Intercreditor Agreement shall provide that prior to the date on which all Senior Secured Debt is discharged
in full (the “Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date”), unless a Super Senior Debt Acceleration Event, a Senior Credit
Facility Acceleration Event, a Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event or an Insolvency Event (as each such term is
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred, the debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payments
to any Cash Management Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in respect of the Cash Management
Liabilities then due to that Cash Management Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) under any Cash
Management Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the applicable Cash
Management Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). Following the occurrence of a Super Senior Debt
Acceleration Event, a Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event, a Senior Credit Facility Acceleration Event or an
Insolvency Event (as each such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing, the debtors under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Third Party Security Providers may not make payments in respect of the Cash Management
Liabilities without the consent of an Instructing Group (as defined below) unless such payments are expressly permitted
under the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with any Enforcement Action taken by the Cash Management Providers
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

_Senior Subordinated Creditors_

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of an “Instructing Group” (as
defined below), neither the Company, the Third Party Security Providers nor any member of the Restricted Group may
make payments in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities without the consent of the “Relevant Representative” (as
defined below) except for the following:

(1) if:

(a) the payment is:

(i) any of the principal or interest (including capitalized interest and default interest) amount of the Senior

Subordinated Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the Senior Credit Facility
financing agreement, the Indenture and any Super Senior Debt financing agreement or (2) paid on or after
the final maturity date of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities (provided that (x) the scheduled maturity date
of such Senior Subordinated Debt is, at the first date of incurrence of such Senior Subordinated Debt, no
earlier than the date falling six months after the original scheduled maturity date of the Notes issued after
the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (it being acknowledged that such Senior Subordinated Debt may
have customary optional redemption, change of control, asset sale and/or other customary mandatory
redemption provisions) and (y) such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the relevant Senior
Subordinated Debt documents as of the first date of incurrence of any Senior Subordinated Debt); or

(ii) any other amount in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities which is not an amount of principal or

capitalized interest and default interest on the Senior Subordinated Liabilities accrued due and payable in
cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant debt documents for the Senior Subordinated Debt
(together, the “Senior Subordinated Debt Documents”), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax
gross-up provisions relating to the Senior Subordinated Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency
indemnities in the relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Documents;

(b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking payments in respect of the

Senior Subordinated Liabilities (a “Payment Blockage Notice”) is outstanding; and

(c) no payment default under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement or comparable provision of any permitted senior

credit facility financing agreement, no payment default under any Notes Document in respect of an amount
constituting principal or interest or otherwise not exceeding €100,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies)
and/or no payment default under an event of default arising by reason of any non-payment under a Super Senior
Debt document, any Senior Credit Facility financing agreement or Cash Management debt document in respect
of an amount constituting principal or interest or otherwise not exceeding €100,000 (or its equivalent in other
currencies) (a “Senior Secured Debt Payment Default”) has occurred and is continuing; or

(2) the “Majority Super Senior Creditors” and the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors” (each as defined below) give prior

consent to that payment being made; or

(3) the payment is a “Permitted Post-Payment Blockage Payment” (as defined below); or

123


-----

(4) the payment is in respect of costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably

incidental to) the Senior Subordinated Debt Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements
under the Senior Subordinated Debt Documents); or

(5) the payment is in respect of costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or

reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Senior Subordinated Debt in compliance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Senior Credit Facility finance agreement, the Indenture and any Super Senior Debt finance agreement;
or

(6) the payment is in respect of certain customary costs and expenses payable to a “Senior Subordinated Debt

Representative” (as defined below).

On or after the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the Obligors may make payments to the Senior Subordinated
Creditors in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Debt Documents.

_Payment Block—Senior Subordinated Debt_

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, if a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing, all payments in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities (other than any payment consented to by the
“Majority Super Senior Creditors” and the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors” (each as defined below) and certain
specified exceptions) are suspended.

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, if an event of default (other than a Senior Secured Debt Payment
Default) under the finance documents in respect of the Senior Secured Debt (a “Senior Secured **Debt Event of Default”)**
has occurred and is continuing, and either the Agent, the creditor representative for any Senior Credit Facility (together the
“Senior Agents” and each a “Senior Agent”), the Trustee or a creditor representative of Super Senior Debt (as the case
may be) (each a “Relevant Representative”) has delivered a Payment Blockage Notice to the Issuer, the Security Agent
and creditor representative of the Senior Subordinated Creditors (the “Senior Subordinated Debt Representative”), all
payments in respect of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors and Majority Senior Secured Creditors (each as defined below) and certain specified exceptions) are suspended
until the earliest of:

(1) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Secured Debt Event of Default in accordance with

the relevant finance documents;

(2) the date on which a default under the Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for failure to pay principal at the original

scheduled maturity of the Senior Subordinated Debt;

(3) the date falling 179 days after the receipt by the Senior Subordinated Debt Representative of the Payment Blockage

Notice;

(4) if a “Standstill Period” (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of a Payment Blockage Notice, the

date on which that Standstill Period expires;

(5) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Debt Event of Default is no longer continuing and, if the relevant Senior

Secured Debt has been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration consisted solely of
declaring the relevant debt payable on demand such rescission can be effected by the relevant majority creditors in
respect of the relevant debt);

(6) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Payment Blockage Notice (and, if at such time a

Senior Secured Debt Event of Default is continuing (other than in relation to the Senior Secured Debt in respect of
which such notice was given), the Relevant Representative(s) in respect of that other Senior Secured Debt) delivers a
notice to the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Subordinated Debt Representative cancelling that Payment
Blockage Notice;

(7) the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date; and

(8) the date on which the Senior Subordinated Debt Representative or the Security Agent takes any Enforcement Action

which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless the Senior Subordinated Debt Representative waives this requirement: (i) no new Payment Blockage
Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately
prior Payment Blockage Notice; and (ii) no Payment Blockage Notice may be served in reliance on a Senior Secured Debt

124


-----

Event of Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that Senior Secured
Debt Event of Default.

The Relevant Representative may only serve one Payment Blockage Notice with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Relevant
Representatives to issue a Payment Blockage Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative in respect of a Senior Secured Debt
Event of Default which had been notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Payment Blockage Notice was
issued.

_Cure of Payment Block—Senior Subordinated Creditors_

If:

(1) at any time following the issue of a Payment Blockage Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Debt Payment

Default, that Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Debt
Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(2) the relevant Obligor then promptly pays to the Senior Subordinated Creditors an amount equal to any payments which

had accrued under any Senior Subordinated Debt Documents and which would have otherwise been entitled to make
but for that Payment Blockage Notice or Senior Secured Debt Payment Default,

(a “Permitted Post-Payment Blockage Payment”), then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be waived and any “Senior Subordinated Debt Enforcement Notice” (as defined below) which
may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being
required on the part of the Senior Subordinated Creditors.

**_Enforcement Action_**

_Permitted enforcement by Senior Subordinated Creditors_

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, neither the Senior Subordinated Debt Representative nor the
Senior Subordinated Creditors may take or require the taking of an Enforcement Action with respect to the Senior
Subordinated Debt without the prior consent of or as required by an “Instructing Group” (as defined below), except if:

(1) an event of default under a Senior Subordinated Debt finance agreement is continuing (the “Relevant Senior

**Subordinated Debt Event of Default”);**

(2) each Relevant Representative has received notice of the Relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default from

the relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Representative;

(3) a Standstill Period has expired; and

(4) the Relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Event of Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Standstill Period,

_provided that in the case of paragraph (2) above only, no such Enforcement Action may be taken if the Security_
Agent is acting in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group to take steps for Enforcement and such
proposed Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Subordinated Debt Documents might reasonably be likely to
adversely affect such Enforcement Action by the Security Agent.

_Standstill on enforcement by Senior Subordinated Creditors_

A “Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice (a “Senior Subordinated **Debt Enforcement Notice”)**
on the Relevant Representatives until the earliest of:

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes any Enforcement Action, provided that (i) if the Senior Subordinated Debt

Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (b), the Senior Subordinated Creditors may only take the same
Enforcement Action against the same entity as is taken by the Security Agent and may not take any other action
against any other member of the Restricted Group, any third party security provider or any holding company and (ii)
Enforcement Action, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), shall not include action taken to preserve or protect any

125


-----

security as opposed to realize it;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Obligor owing Senior Subordinated Liabilities

and against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(d) the expiration of any other Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the

current Senior Subordinated Debt Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or other
permitted remedy thereof).

_Composition of the instructing creditor groups_

The Intercreditor Agreement will generally provide that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise by an Instructing Group. Each of the creditor groups referred to below
under this caption constitute an “Instructing Group.”

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, the Super Senior Lenders, the Additional Super Senior Lenders and the

Priority Hedge Counterparties whose credit participations represent more than 66[2]∕3% of the aggregate credit
participations of all Super Senior Lenders, Additional Super Senior Lenders and Priority Hedge Counterparties (the
“Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement);

(b) In relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement:

(i) Prior to the first date on which all Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged to the

satisfaction of the Super Senior Agent (in the case of the Super Senior Debt Liabilities), each Cash Management
Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (in the case of its Cash Management Liabilities) and each
Priority Hedge Counterparty (in the case of its Priority Hedging Liabilities), whether or not as the result of an
enforcement, and the Super Senior Creditors (in that capacity) are under no further obligation to provide financial
accommodation to any of the debtors under the debt documents (such date, the “Super Senior Discharge Date”),
the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in each case subject to a
consultation period referred to under the caption “—Consultation” below and provided that such instructions are
consistent with the “Security Enforcement Principles” (as defined below) as generally described below under the
caption “—Security Enforcement Principles”; and

(ii) On or after the Super Senior Lender Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the

Majority Senior Secured Creditors; and

(c) Following the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, those Senior Subordinated Creditors whose credit participations

at that time aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate credit participations of all Senior Subordinated Creditors (the
“Majority Senior Subordinated Creditors”).

_Consultation_

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a “distressed disposal” and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction Security on
a distressed disposal (each an “Enforcement”), the relevant creditor representative(s) of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall first notify the Security Agent and the creditor representative for
each of the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has
become enforceable.

As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions
to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as the case may be), the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the
relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which the Super Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Senior Credit Facility Agent and the Trustee will consult in good faith with each
other and the Security Agent for a period of not less than 30 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or
such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) (the “Consultation Period”) with a view to coordinating the
instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy.

Generally, no such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the
end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles
(“Qualifying Instructions”)) where:

126


-----

(a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting the Company, any Debtor

(owing liabilities to any Primary Creditor or the Company) or any “significant subsidiary” (as applicable) (each a
“Relevant Company”); or

(b) subject to no instructions being given by an Instructing Group at any time (whether before or after the end of the

Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred which is continuing with respect to a Third Party Security
Provider or Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in
lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Third Party Security Provider or Relevant
Company, if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith
(and notify the creditor representatives of the other Super Senior Lenders, Cash Management Providers (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement), Additional Super Senior Lenders, Priority Hedge Counterparties, the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the
commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely
to be realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the “Payments Waterfall” (as
defined below) described below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds/Waterfall”) the Senior Liabilities
would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve
the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or, as the case may be, the Super Senior Creditors on behalf of which the
relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

If, following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes silence is deemed
to be a conflicting instruction) are received from either Instructing Group by the end of (or following) the Consultation
Period, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
and/or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, provided that any such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received
by the Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked.

If, prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, either (x) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within
six months of the end of the Consultation Period, (y) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any
transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period or (z) at any
time (whether before or after the end of the Consultation Period) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Third
Party Security Provider or Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any
transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Third Party Security Provider or Relevant
Company, then, in relation to instructions with respect to any Enforcement, the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any
instructions that are subsequently given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are
Qualifying Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting
with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors).

_Security Enforcement Principles_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in
accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which principles shall include the following:

(a) It shall be the aim of any Enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt

and expeditious realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, and in a manner consistent with
the Intercreditor Agreement, the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and their
representatives, and the Senior Subordinated Creditors (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure
such debt) and their representatives (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(b) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective and unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Super Senior

Creditors, the Transaction Security will be enforced and any other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that
either:

(i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for distribution

in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or

(ii) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the

proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged
in full.

127


-----

(c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious and should be reasonably expected to realize value from the

Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to Enforcement by no later than the day
falling six (6) months after the last day of the Consultation Period.

(d) On:

(i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of the

Restricted Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds €5,000,000 (or its equivalent in any
other currency or currencies); or

(ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the

Restricted Group over which Transaction Security exists,

the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group) shall (unless such enforcement is made
pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain
an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other
reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar
or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as
expert:

(A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective

and maximize the recovery of any such Enforcement Action;

(B) that the proceeds received from Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all

relevant circumstances; and

(C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a Financial

Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. It is understood that the Financial Advisor
may limit its liability in respect of the opinion referred to in paragraph (d) above to the amount of its fees in respect
of such engagement.

The Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any
other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account
all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, following the expiry of the six (6) month period
referred to above, the Security Enforcement Objective shall cease to apply to any enforcement of the Transaction Security
until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to above and such
Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Restricted Group shall be entitled to
participate in such auction. Nothing in the Security Enforcement Principles requires Enforcement of Transaction Security
to take place by way of public auction.

In the absence of written notice from a Creditor or group of Creditors that are not part of the relevant Instructing
Group that such Creditor(s) object(s) to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement
Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to
assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on
other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s
Opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement
Objective will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.

**_Turnover_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that, subject to certain exceptions, if any Primary Creditor receives
or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security applied other than in accordance with the
Payments Waterfall, it shall:

128


-----

   - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off: (i) hold an amount of that receipt
or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities on trust for the Security Agent and separate from other assets, property
or funds and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or
recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

   - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to
that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall_

Subject to certain exceptions, all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection
with the realization or Enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security or otherwise paid to the Security Agent
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement for application below shall be held by the Security Agent on trust to apply
them at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law and in the
following order of priority (the “Payments Waterfall”):

###### • first, in payment of the following amounts, inter alia, in the following order: (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums
owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any delegate and certain fees, costs and expenses (including the costs
of any actual or attempted Enforcement Action); and then (ii) _pari passu and_ _pro rata to each other creditor_
representative of the Primary Creditors in respect of their costs and expenses (to the extent not included in (i)
above and excluding any Hedge Counterparty as its own creditor representative);

###### • second, pari passu and pro rata, in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Super Senior
Creditors in connection with the realization or enforcement of Transaction Security taken in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

###### • third, pari passu and pro rata, in or towards payment to: (i) each creditor representative in respect of a Super
Senior Facility on its own behalf and on behalf of the arrangers and lenders under the Super Senior Facilities at
such time; (ii) the Priority Hedge Counterparties (generally, in proportion to each Priority Hedge Counterparty’s
“super senior” hedging amount subject to a cap in respect of all Priority Hedge Counterparties) and (iii) the Cash
Management Providers (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);

###### • fourth, pari passu and pro rata in or towards payment to: to the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes and to the relevant creditor representative of the Senior Creditors it represents for application
towards any unpaid costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of any holders of the Senior Secured Notes and
Senior Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Transaction Security taken in accordance
with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the
request of the Security Agent;

###### • fifth, pari passu and pro rata in or towards payment to: (i) the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes; (ii) each creditor representative of the Senior Creditors it represents and the arranger liabilities in
accordance with the Senior Credit Facility Documents and (iii) the Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties;

###### • sixth, (if such Transaction Security is expressed to secure the Senior Subordinated Liabilities) pari passu and pro
_rata in or towards payment to each Senior Subordinated Debt Representative on_ behalf of the Senior Subordinated
Creditors it represents for application towards any unpaid costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of any
Senior Subordinated Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Transaction Security taken
in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

###### • seventh, (if such Transaction Security is expressed to secure the Senior Subordinated Liabilities) to each Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative on behalf of the Senior Subordinated Creditors it represents for application
towards the discharge of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities on a pari passu and pro rata basis;

###### • eighth, in payment to any other person to whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any debtor
under the Intercreditor Agreement or Third Party Security Provider; and

###### • ninth, the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant debtor or third party security provider under the Intercreditor

Agreement.

**_Disposals_**

_Non-distressed Disposals_

Generally, in circumstances where a disposal or certain other specified transactions (including mergers,
reorganizations and other transactions) are not being effected pursuant to a “Distress Event” (as defined below) (a disposal
effected pursuant to a Distress Event being a “Distressed Disposal”) and are otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Indenture, the Cash RCF Facility and the L/G RCF Facility, any Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Subordinated Debt
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is authorized: (i) to release the Transaction
Security (and in connection with such release, execute any related documents); and (ii) if the relevant asset consists of
shares in the capital of an Obligor, to release the Transaction Security or any other claim in respect of the liabilities secured
by the Transaction Security over the assets of that Obligor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries (and in
connection with such release, execute any related documents).

_Distressed Disposals_

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the
Security Agent is authorized:

(a) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any release

of that Transaction Security, or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent
to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor, to release: (i) that Obligor and any

subsidiary of that Obligor from all or any part of its “borrowing liabilities” and “guarantee liabilities” to the Super
Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors, the Senior Subordinated Creditors, the Intra-Group Lenders and the
Shareholder Creditors (together, the “Primary Liabilities”) or “other liabilities” it may have to Shareholder Creditors,
Intra-Group Lenders or Obligors (together, the “Other Liabilities”); (ii) any Transaction Security granted by that
Obligor or any subsidiary of that Obligor over any of its assets and any holding company of that Obligor over any
shares, loans, claims or other rights in or against that Obligor; and (iii) any other claim of a Shareholder Creditor,
Intra-Group Lender, or another Obligor over that Obligor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Obligor;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Obligor, to release: (i)

that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its Primary Liabilities and
Other Liabilities; (ii) any Transaction Security granted by any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its
assets and any holding company of that holding company over shares, loans, claims or other rights in or against that
holding company and (iii) any other claim of a Shareholder Creditor, Intra-Group Lender or another Obligor over the
assets of any subsidiary of that holding company; and

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor or a holding company of an Obligor, to

provide for (1) the transfer of liabilities to another Obligor and/or (2) at the discretion of the Security Agent (provided
that it is acting in accordance with the Security Enforcement Principles) the disposal, to third parties, of creditors’
claims against that Obligor or holding company (which may include claims against the Issuer).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the claims of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Liabilities
and Transaction Security over shares in (and any shareholder loans to) the Issuer or assets of a guarantor of Senior
Subordinated Liabilities or the Issuer will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(i) the Senior Subordinated Debt Representative has approved the release on the instructions of the requisite Senior

Subordinated Creditors (as determined under the relevant Senior Subordinated Debt Documents or, if not addressed
thereunder, with the approval of at least a majority of such Senior Subordinated Liabilities); or

(ii) each of the following conditions are satisfied:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(B) all present and future obligations owed to the Senior Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents by a

member of the Restricted Group, all of whose shares are pledged under the Transaction Security are sold or
disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and such obligations are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its
affiliates), and all Transaction Security in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and

130


-----

unconditionally released concurrently with such sale; and

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction; or

(II) where an internationally recognized investment bank or an internationally recognized firm of accountants

selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount
received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement and the circumstances giving rise to such sale, provided
that the liability of such investment bank or internationally recognized firm of accountants in giving such
opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the
Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Application of
_Proceeds/Waterfall” above as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to_
the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

**_Option to Purchase_**

Generally, subject to the following paragraph, following:

(a) any notice that the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or

(b) either (i) an acceleration of the Super Senior Facilities, any Senior Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes or the

Senior Subordinated Debt, or (ii) the enforcement of any Transaction Security (a “Distress Event”),

the holders of the Senior Secured Notes shall have an option to purchase all (but not part) of the Super Senior
Lenders’ or Additional Super Senior Lenders’ commitments under the Super Senior Facilities and all their exposures in
respect of any Hedging Agreement in respect of Super Senior Facilities at par plus accrued interest and all other amounts
owing under the Super Senior Finance Documents or relevant Hedging Agreement (as the case may be) (in each case as
defined under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement).

Following any notice that the Transaction Security has become enforceable or a Distress Event, the holders of the
Senior Subordinated Debt shall also have an option to purchase all (but not part) of the Senior Secured Debt at par plus
accrued interest and all other amounts owing in respect of such Senior Secured Debt, with such purchase to occur all at the
same time.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law save for the clause
headed “German Law Security Property” and the relevant section of the clause headed “Governing Law,” which shall be
governed by German law.

**Factoring Arrangements**

**_ABN AMRO Factoring Agreement_**

In 2018, certain members of the Group entered into a factoring agreement with ABN AMRO Asset Based Finance
N.V., Germany Branch in connection with the non-recourse undisclosed factoring of third-party trade receivables (the
“ABN AMRO Factoring Agreement”). The ABN AMRO Factoring Agreement provided for a maximum total funding
amount of €35 million. The ABN AMRO Factoring Agreement was terminated with effect as of June 30, 2024.

As of March 31, 2024, €26.7 million were utilized under the ABN AMRO Factoring Agreement.

**_CALF Factoring Agreement_**

On March 11, 2024, 14 Kelvion entities – Kelvion AB, Sweden; Kelvion S.A.S, France; Kelvion S.R.L., Italy;
Kelvion AB Denmark Branch; Kelvion SRO, Czech Republic; Kelvion Machine Cooling Sp. z o.o., Poland; Kelvion Ltd.,
England; Kelvion Machine Cooling Systems GmbH (MON), Germany; Kelvion Machine Cooling Systems GmbH (HER),
Germany; Kelvion PHE GmbH, Germany; Kelvion Brazed PHE GmbH, Germany; Kelvion Refrigeration B.V., the
Netherlands; Kelvion Machine Cooling B.V., the Netherlands; and Kelvion Holding GmbH, Germany (the “Kelvion
**Entities”) – entered into a factoring agreement (the “CALF Factoring Agreement”) with Crédit Agricole Leasing &**
Factoring, France (“CALF”). Pursuant to the CALF Factoring Agreement, the Kelvion Entities assign to CALF on an

131


-----

ongoing, non-recourse basis certain receivables (including related rights) against third parties and CALF purchases all
receivables that CALF has, in its sole discretion, determined to be eligible. As part of such assignment, the Kelvion Entities
grant a pledge over the receivables and entitle CALF to benefit from cross-guarantees among subsidiaries thereunder.

The CALF Factoring Agreement provides for a maximum total funding amount for the Group of €50 million, with
an agreed retention amount (subject to adjustments at the discretion of CALF), and for payment from client inflows within
certain agreed payment terms. The factoring arrangement is subject to a financing fee – comprising an index-based amount
(three-month EURIBOR / TSSR (SONIA) / TSSR (SOFR) / WIBOR / STIBOR / CIBOR /PRIBOR, as the case may be)
and a margin depending on the currency in which the receivables in question are denominated, as well as an annual
minimum fee.

The CALF Factoring Agreement is governed by the laws of France and provides for customary warranties,
guarantees and information obligations. Additionally, it includes customary event of default provisions relating to, among
others, change of control and change of ownership. It has an initial term of three years, which will automatically be extended
for an indefinite term unless it is terminated by any of the parties with six months’ prior written notice.

As of March 31, 2024, €0.6 million were utilized under the CALF Factoring Agreement.

**Preferred Equity Certificates**

On December 31, 2020, the Issuer issued tracking preferred equity certificates (“TPECs”) in an initial aggregate
principal amount of €136.5 million and with a term of 30 years to its immediate shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l.
On or about the Issue Date, the TPECs will be amended to reflect the repayment of the Existing Notes, the Existing RCF
Facility Agreement and the Existing L/G Facility Agreement as well as the issuance of the Notes and the entry into the
Super Senior Facilities Agreement. As of March 31, 2024, €173.4 million were outstanding under the TPECs.

The TPECs carry a yield at a fixed rate plus a variable yield based on a net eligible income of the Issuer, which
can be distributed on an annual basis subject to compliance with certain conditions. If the management of the Issuer, at its
sole discretion, decides not to distribute the yield in cash, the Issuer may capitalize the yield annually.

The TPECs shall be redeemable at the option of the Issuer’s management, acting in their sole discretion or the
passing of the mandatory redemption date. The mandatory redemption date of the TPECs by their terms is the later of (i)
the date falling thirty years after the issue date or (ii) the date of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, bankruptcy,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Issuer. The TPECs are subject to early redemption mechanism in the case of
an occurrence of an event of default and such redemption shall occur on terms as if the maturity date had occurred. The
Issuer is only obliged to redeem the TPECs if (i) it is not, immediately before and after giving effect to such payment,
insolvent, (ii) such payment does not violate any covenant contained in or results in a default under any agreement or other
financial obligation of the Issuer and (iii), in the case of a voluntary liquidation, with the prior written consent of the holders
of the TPECS representing 50% of more of the aggregate nominal amount of the TPECs.

Holders of the TPECs may not grant guarantee or security in respect thereof prior to June 2026 (which date will
be extended on or about the Issue to fall after the maturity date of the Notes). Holders of record of the TPECs have the
same voting rights as those set forth in articles 470-2 et seq. of the Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915 regarding
commercial companies, as amended.

The TPECs are subordinated by their terms to all existing and future third-party indebtedness of the Issuer and are
intended to constitute “Subordinated Shareholder Funding” as defined in “Description of the Notes.”

The TPECs are governed by Luxembourg law.

**Local Credit Lines**

From time to time, we enter into local credit lines or guarantee facilities to fund local operations, provide local
letters of credit and for other general corporate purposes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have entered
into bilateral bank loans mainly in Brazil and, to a minor extent, in France. As of March 31, 2024, our liabilities under
these bank loans amounted to €5.1 million and we had approximately €16 million of letters of credit outstanding under
local letter of credit facilities.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this_ “Description of the Notes” under the heading
“Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to the
_Issuer and its subsidiaries and references to the “Issuer” refer to Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l._

The Issuer will issue €425.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2029
(the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of    , 2024 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, Mangrove
LuxCo IV S.à r.l., Mangrove GermanCo I GmbH, Mangrove GermanCo II GmbH, Kelvion Holding GmbH, Kelvion
Germany GmbH, Kelvion Industriebeteiligungen GmbH, Kelvion Machine Cooling Systems GmbH, Kelvion Brazed PHE
GmbH, Kelvion Thermal Solutions Holding GmbH and, Kelvion Thermal Solutions Germany GmbH, and Kelvion PHE
GmbH as guarantors (the “Initial Guarantors”), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”) and as paying agent. The Indenture will not
be qualified under, incorporate or include, by reference or otherwise, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with cash on hand, will be used (i) to
redeem the Existing Notes in full, (ii) for general corporate purposes, including certain capital expenditures as well as
expenses expected to be incurred in connection with a production footprint alignment program in the EMEA region and
(iii) to pay costs, fees and expenses related to the Transactions as set forth in “Use of Proceeds.” The Indenture will be
unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €425.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes will be issued in
this Offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes having identical
terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Additional Notes”). Any Additional Notes shall have the same terms and
conditions as the Notes in all respects except (i) for the issue date, the commencement of interest payment obligations
and/or the issue price, (ii) that the redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to,
pursuant to any special mandatory redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the
issuance of such Additional Notes are deposited is conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment,
refinancing or other transaction and (iii) for the escrow of all or a portion of the proceeds of such Additional Notes and the
granting of Liens described in clause (30) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security agent
solely for the benefit of the holders of such Additional Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the
holders of any other Notes). We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants
contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”). Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued
in this Offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that, if
any issuance of Additional Notes is not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional
Notes shall have a different CUSIP, ISIN or other identifying number than any previously issued Notes but shall otherwise
be treated as a single class with all other Notes issued under the Indenture. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this
“Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (each as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms
and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the Indenture
and the Security Documents, and it refers to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Since this description of the
terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as defined below) and
your rights. Copies of the Indenture are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies.
The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will, upon issuance:

    - be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes;

    - be secured as set forth under _“—Collateral” on a first-ranking basis along with the obligations under the_
Super Senior Facilities Agreement; however, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after any obligations secured on a super-priority basis,
including obligations under the Super Senior Facilities and certain future hedging obligations (if any), have
been repaid in full;

    - be pari passu with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes, including obligations under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is unsecured or secured by liens
junior to the liens securing the Notes, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing
such indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not
Guarantors.

**_The Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Initial Guarantors. Within 120
days following the Issue Date, the Notes will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be guaranteed on a senior secured
basis by Kelvion, Inc., Kelvion Products, Inc, Kelvion Machine Cooling Sp. z o.o. Kelvion Sp. z o.o. and Kelvion B.V.
(the “Post-Issue Date Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”).

Each Guarantee of a Guarantor will, at the time a Guarantor grants such Guarantee:

    - be general senior obligations of that Guarantor;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the respective Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of the respective Guarantor;

Senior Facilities Agreement; however, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of
the Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after any obligations secured on a super-priority basis,
including obligations under the Super Senior Facilities and certain future hedging obligations (if any), have
been repaid in full;

    - be pari passu with all existing and future obligations of the respective Guarantor that are not subordinated in
right of payment to the Guarantee of the respective Guarantor, including obligations under the Super Senior
Facilities Agreement;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future indebtedness of the respective Guarantor that is unsecured or
secured by liens junior to the liens securing the Guarantee of the respective Guarantor, to the extent of the
value of such Collateral;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness of the respective Guarantor that
is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Guarantee of the respective Guarantor, to the extent of
the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of subsidiaries of the respective
Guarantor that are not Guarantors; and

134


-----

    - be subject to the limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the
_Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance requirements and other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue €425.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date (the “Initial
**Notes”). The Notes will mature on    , 2029. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in**
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal outstanding on the Notes (the
“Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor) plus (ii)     %,
as determined by the calculation agent appointed by the Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purpose of the Indenture (the
“Calculation Agent”), who shall initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

Interest on the Notes will:

  - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

  - be payable in cash quarterly in arrear on    ,   ,     and     of each year, commencing on    , 2024;

  - be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest
payment date (for so long as Notes are registered in book-entry form); and

  - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed on the aggregate principal
amount outstanding.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than
the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Notes.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Notes.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits
in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date
that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11.00 a.m. London time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters
Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request
the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the
Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11.00 a.m.,
London time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Representative
Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three
major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum), as of approximately 11.00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount
in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic
mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in
effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. If less than 0%, the rate shall be deemed to be 0%.

If the Issuer determines in good faith prior to any Determination Date, that:

(1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

135


-----

(4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets
applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third-party agent of the Issuer to calculate any
payments due to Holders using EURIBOR,

the Issuer in consultation with a Rate Determination Agent shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is
substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or
similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that has developed
or is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes (and
any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances,
any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the
“Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by
way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least two Business
Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee,
the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry,
investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate
the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further
action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee provided that if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information
provided by the Issuer with respect to such Successor Rate or Adjustment Spread (if any) to calculate, or calculate
definitely, the interest rate applicable to the Interest Period commencing immediately following notification thereof,
then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately
preceding Interest Period. For the avoidance of doubt, if, in any case, that rate determined in accordance with the above
is less than 0%, such rate shall be deemed to be 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any
Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread). Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all
references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).
None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or inaction
of the Issuer or its determination of the Successor Rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the Trustee,
Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with such new rate
which may, in its opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to any additional liabilities or
increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections.

“Eurozone” means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest
Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on, but exclude,    , 2024.

“Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the Issuer at the
expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under (a), the Issuer.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (1) EUR 1.0 million and (2) an amount that is representative for
a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“T2” means the real time gross settlement system operated by the Eurosystem, or any successor system.

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which T2 is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest
Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal
amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual
number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above
calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five
one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655%
(or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the
absence of willful default or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the
Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall
not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

-----

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the specified
office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to the Notes represented by
one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
Holder or Holders thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee).

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive Registered
**Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In**
addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown
on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time
to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Initial Guarantors. Within 120
days following the Issue Date, the Notes will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be guaranteed on a senior secured
basis by the Post-Issue Date Guarantors. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the external revenue,
aggregated EBITDA and aggregated total assets, each calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding intra-group
profits of the Issuer and the Guarantors together represented 73.2%, 95.5% and 66.8% of the external revenue, aggregated
EBITDA and total assets, respectively, of the Group.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and
other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a
description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance requirements and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral,”_
“—Other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance statutes may adversely affect
_their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Issuer is a holding company that does not have, and is not expected to have, any revenue-generating activities
of its own and does not have, and is not expected to have, any business operations or material assets (other than its
shareholding in Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l.). Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade
creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims
of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other
than the Guarantors). Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock
of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not
impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

137


-----

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Super Senior Facilities,
Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such
grant would be restricted by general statutory and other legal limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, equity subordination, fraudulent preference, interest tripping, controlled foreign corporation, tax
restrictions, capital maintenance, transfer pricing, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.
By virtue of such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may effectively have no obligation under its Guarantee.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject
to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate
benefit, financial assistance, capital maintenance, liquidity protection and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or
a Guarantor may effectively have no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance requirements and other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral,” “—Other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance statutes_
_may adversely affect their validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on_
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release as described under “Certain Covenants—Release of the
_Guarantees.”_

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:

    - Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited
with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

    - Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under the section “Transfer
_Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear_
or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject
to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry
**Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form**
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities
Act.

Prior to 40 days after the Issue Date of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited
to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or
Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such
resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S
Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such

138


-----

transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under the section “Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry
Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to
all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was
transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating
thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such
instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which
owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will,
except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject
to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under
the section “Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the
transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to
furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish
certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder
of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture,
except for Kelvion Mashimpeks LLC and Enexio Poland Sp. z o.o. as well as their respective Subsidiaries, which will be
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”_
The Issuer’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Certain
_subsidiaries of the Issuer will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries and therefore not subject to the restrictive covenants under the_
_Indenture.”_

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to certain perfection requirements and any Permitted
Collateral Liens, by security interests granted on an equal and ratable first priority basis over:

    - the shares in the Initial Guarantors;

    - certain receivables in respect of structural intercompany loans owing to the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors;
and

139


-----

    - material bank accounts of the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer
or the relevant Initial Guarantor, as applicable,

(collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”).

Within 120 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, be secured by:

    - the shares in the Post-Issue Date Guarantors;

    - certain receivables in respect of structural intercompany loans owing to the Post-Issue Date Guarantors;

    - material bank accounts of the Post-Issue Date Guarantors in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant
Post-Issue Date Guarantor; and

    - substantially all of the assets of Kelvion, Inc. and Kelvion Products, Inc. (pursuant to an all asset security
agreement),

(collectively, the “Post-Issue Date Collateral” and together with the Issue Date Collateral and the Post-Issue
Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or
Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes issued by the Issuer as permitted under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral.”_

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Guarantee
and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security
Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Future Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets_
may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed
Security Principles, a guarantee or security may not be given, or may be limited. The following is a non-exhaustive
summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles which include, among others:

    - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital
maintenance, equity subordination, fraudulent preference, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign
corporation,” transfer pricing or “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims and
similar principles may prohibit, limit or otherwise restrict the ability of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or
otherwise. If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided (or the enforceability thereof) will
be limited to the maximum amount which the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may provide, having
regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence or case law) and subject to fiduciary duties of
management. A guarantee or security interest will not be required if, or its enforceability will be limited if
and to the extent that, giving such guarantee or taking such security would expose the directors, officers or
employees of the relevant company to a risk of personal liability. The Issuer will use reasonable endeavors
to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to each Guarantor;

    - certain supervisory board, advisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or
another external body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
to provide a guarantee or security. Such guarantee and/or security shall not be required unless requested by
the agent for the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement prior to signing any applicable Security
Document or supplemental indenture and such consent has been received provided that reasonable endeavors
have been used by the Issuer or relevant Restricted Subsidiary (without incurring material cost) to obtain the
relevant consent to the extent permissible by law and regulation and such consent has no material adverse
impact on relationships with third parties;

    - a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security shall be taken (and the extent of the
perfection and/or registration of such security) is the applicable time and cost to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (including adverse effects in relation to taxes, interest deductibility and stamp duty, notarization,

140


-----

translation costs and registration fees), which shall not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the
lenders of obtaining such guarantee, security or perfection;

- the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration
or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is
disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount
payable by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and
VAT relating to the provision of guarantees and security shall be limited to an amount to be agreed between
the Security Agent and the Issuer);

- it is acknowledged that in certain jurisdictions, it may be impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly
to create guarantees or security over certain categories of assets, in which event guarantees or security will
not be taken over such assets;

- any assets or companies subject to third-party arrangements which may prevent those assets from being
charged or assigned or those companies from giving a security or guarantee (or assets which, if charged or
assigned, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or
obligations of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in respect of those assets or require the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to take any action materially adverse to their interests) will be excluded from any
relevant Security Document and any requirement to give security or guarantee provided that reasonable
endeavors (without incurring material cost) to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the
Issuer and the Guarantors if the relevant asset is material and if, in the view of the Issuer (acting reasonably),
taking such security will have no material adverse impact on commercial relationships with third parties or
otherwise force the Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur any
material cost;

- the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security
Documents if (A) it is not within their legal capacity to do so or (B) it would conflict with the fiduciary duties
of their directors, officers or employees, contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition, bona fide contractual
restriction or regulatory condition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any director,
officer or employee provided that the Issuer or relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall use reasonable endeavors
to overcome any such obstacle without incurring material cost;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security or the perfection of security granted will not be required if
it would be unduly burdensome or restrict the ability of the Issuer or relevant Guarantor to conduct its
operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the Super Senior Facilities
Agreement and the “finance documents” thereunder (including, without limitation, notification of receivables
security to third party debtors or a charge over bank accounts until an enforcement event has occurred and is
continuing), and any requirement under these Agreed Security Principles to seek the consent of any person
or to take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph;

- unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the Issuer or a
Guarantor or under English law, all security (other than share security over its guarantor company
subsidiaries, where applicable) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction
of incorporation or formation of the Issuer or that Guarantor;

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required;

- security or guarantees shall only be required to be given by or in respect of an entity or any assets incorporated
or located, as the case may be, in a jurisdiction other than China, India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and other
jurisdictions as may be agreed between the agent under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement (acting on the
instructions of an agreed majority of the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement) and the Issuer
(each acting reasonably) (or over the shares of any entity incorporated in such jurisdiction);

- no guarantee or security will be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement or any minority interest;

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer and the Guarantors are not incorporated
or formed;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security
over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the
material assets only;

141


-----

    - in no event shall control agreements or perfection by control or similar arrangements be required with respect
to any assets (including, but not limited to, deposit or securities accounts and uncertificated shares);

    - other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action will be required
with respect to assets of a type not owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

    - no security will be granted over escrow accounts in connection with an acquisition, a disposal or an offering
of debt securities and share capital increase accounts;

    - other than over certain material structural receivables, no security will be granted over intercompany
receivables or receivables that are made as part of the cash pooling system of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries;

    - no security will be granted over parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables if it would require
labelling, segregation or periodic listing or specification of such parts, stock, moveable plants, equipment or
receivable;

    - perfection will not be required in respect of (A) vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title or
(B) letter of credit rights and tort claims (or the local law equivalent);

    - no security will be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party or any cash constituting
regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant Security
Document); and

    - security will only be granted over shares in wholly-owned subsidiaries.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Super Senior Facilities, as well
as certain future Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain future indebtedness; provided,
_however, that the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities, counterparties to certain future Hedging Obligations and_
creditors of additional Indebtedness that may be secured on a super-priority basis, will receive the proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes. See “—Priority.” See also,
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
_creditors under the Super Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations, cash management obligations and_
_certain additional indebtedness with “super senior” status are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral_
_sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes.”_

The lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and/or counterparties to certain future Hedging Obligations and any
Additional Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Notes offered hereby.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may
not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees
_and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Super Senior
Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain future Hedging Obligations (if any) and (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent
and the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Super Senior Facilities and such Hedging
Obligations (if any) which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Notes will receive proceeds on
enforcement of security over the Collateral only after the claims of the Super Senior Facilities and such future Hedging
Obligations and any future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super-priority basis in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, are satisfied. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the
Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged or assigned to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

142


-----

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment when
due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture (including by virtue of a parallel debt
arrangement set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement). The Security Documents will be entered into among, inter alios, the
relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security
Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes from time to time) and, in the case of certain accessory security interests, as creditor
under the parallel debt arrangement. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the
lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to
the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of
the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent under the Indenture. To the extent
permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, Holders of the
Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide instructions to the Security Agent for the
enforcement of security over the Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf
of the lenders under the Super Senior Facilities and the counterparties under certain hedging agreements, if any, in relation
to the Security Interests in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the
Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the
Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Release of Liens” below. The validity and enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the
limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests.”_

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security
Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement
could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security
Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Guarantees, the Notes and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the
Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively,
take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through
the Security Agent or the Trustee (as applicable).

To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide instructions to
the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will
restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security
Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Super
Senior Facilities. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to
future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured
by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security
Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness,
including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Super Senior Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, authorized the Security Agent to: (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are
specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including
the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security

Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on
its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(3) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(4) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—
_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide_
_that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent in relation to the Super Senior Facilities Agreement_
_and any additional secured debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the Super Senior Facilities Agreement,_
_will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of the Security Interests
in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the pledge over the shares in
Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l.) to (a) any Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but
excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale
or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or_
(b) any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause (b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer
of capital stock or of accounts receivable to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary)
unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor
of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness that
gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released and such Lien is not otherwise
required to be granted in favor of the Notes as provided under “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on
_Liens”;_

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or
discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

144


-----

(7) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) pursuant to a Permitted Reorganization or (other than the pledge over the shares in Mangrove LuxCo IV
S.à r.l.) in the case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in compliance with the covenant
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”; or

(9) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” or as otherwise provided in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional_
Intercreditor Agreement.

At the request of the Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action required
to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action
on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not
redeemable until    , 2025.

On and after    , 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption
date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

In addition, prior to,    , 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus
the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date).

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such
notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or
all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed, _provided_
that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such
redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. In no event
shall the Trustee be responsible for monitoring, or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of the
Notes eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed.

**_General_**

Subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, we and our Affiliates may at any time and
from time to time repurchase Notes. Any such purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated
transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at
such prices as well as with such consideration as we or any such Affiliates may determine. Notice of redemption will be
provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business
on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by
the Issuer.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

145


-----

**Post Tender Redemption**

In connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tendered and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the holders of the Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other
offer and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase, at a price (excluding any early tender premium or similar
payment) equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in
the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding such redemption date.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On    , 2029 the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and
cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to
the redemption date.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select Notes for
redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed,
and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange
prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream
prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis by use of a pool factor; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000
in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be
redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance
with this paragraph.

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to the extent
that the rules and regulations of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require, the
Issuer shall notify the Authority of such redemption and, in addition to such publication, not less than 10 days nor more
than 60 days prior to the redemption, the Issuer will deliver, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be delivered, such
notice to Holders. All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register
of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of
Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream in
substitution for the aforesaid mailing to Holders.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered
Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a
Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on
Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax
**Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the**
relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer
determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official written position regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing
in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

146


-----

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment
giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available
to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable,
_provided however, that changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this section)._
Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing
provisions shall apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the_
Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given: (a) earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts;
and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to
the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the
Trustee: (i) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied; and (ii) an opinion of an independent
tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the relevant Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of tax
counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or
with respect to any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or
on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Luxembourg or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to
tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of the Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3) a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent
under or with respect to any Note or any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional
**Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding**
or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the
amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of
such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without
limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident, national or domiciliary of, or
carrying on a business for tax purposes, or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically
present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely
from the acquisition, ownership, holding or sale of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Guarantee;

147


-----

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with a written request of the Payor or any other person through whom payment can be
made addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice by the Payor (at least 60 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy
any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or
part of such Tax (including a reduced rate of withholding) but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more
than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the
extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on
any day (including the last day) within any such 30 day period);

(4) any German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer), plus solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) and
church tax (Kirchensteuer), if any, thereon, levied in Germany by a custodian bank or a disbursing agent
acting on behalf of the Holder;

(5) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to the Defense against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur
_Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb) as amended from time to time (including_
any ordinance (Verordnung) enacted based on this law);

(6) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(7) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(8) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union (other
than Luxembourg); or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a person who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such
fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, any amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on behalf of the
Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described in
Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations thereunder or official interpretations thereof) or an
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or
any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices implementing such an intergovernmental agreement) (any such
withholding or deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”). Neither the Issuer nor any other person will be required to pay any
additional amounts in respect of FATCA Withholding.

The Payor will (i) make or cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available, other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and copied to the Paying Agent.
Such copies or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices
of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so
payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the

148


-----

relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 30 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that
is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder or beneficial owner for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, transfer, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or
additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest,
penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, or registration of any
Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in
connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such
taxes or charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties, or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a
result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes or any Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of the receipt of
any payments with respect thereto, to taxes or similar charges or levies imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are
not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) above or clauses (7) through (9) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer
by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to
a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any
jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes is made by or on behalf of such Payor,
or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a_
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase the Notes as described under this
heading “—Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all
of the Notes of such series as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after_
any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of Notes, with a
copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

149


-----

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes
so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry)
to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any, provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that
is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to the extent
that the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control
Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or
similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a
transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer
is made. The closing date of any such Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control may be changed
to conform to the actual closing date of the Change of Control, provided that such closing date is not earlier than 30 days
nor later than 60 days from the date the Change of Control Offer notice is mailed as described in the second paragraph of
this section.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent
that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in
lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the

150


-----

Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more
than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may require a mandatory
prepayment of certain Indebtedness. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under certain
Indebtedness and may require a mandatory prepayment of such Indebtedness may not constitute a Change of Control under
the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that
would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover,
the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require
a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the
Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary
to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The
_Issuer may not be able to repay the Notes, when due or to repurchase the Notes when the Issuer is required to do so_
_pursuant to certain events constituting a Change of Control or otherwise, and the Change of Control provision contained_
_in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body
of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially
all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding
principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); _provided,_ _however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness_
(including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including
pro forma application of the proceeds thereof):

(1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least
2.0 to 1.0; and

(2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is
incurred would have been no greater than 2.75 to 1.0.

Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors may only incur Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant if the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Indebtedness, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors
(calculated at the time of such incurrence and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application
of proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis) would not exceed an amount equal to the greater of €30.0 million and 20% of
Consolidated EBITDA.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
**Debt”):**

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to:

(a) any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or
created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in
respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding
not exceeding the greater of (i) €65.0 million and (ii) 40% of Consolidated EBITDA; plus

151


-----

(2)


(b) any Guarantee Facilities,

_plus, in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion_
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;


(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) in the case of Indebtedness owing by the Issuer or any Guarantor to any Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor (except in respect of intercompany liabilities Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or in connection with cash pooling or cash management or tax positions of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) and if the aggregate principal amount of such
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor exceeds €10.0 million, such Indebtedness shall, to
the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and the Guarantors having completed all procedures
required in the reasonable judgment of the directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to
protect such Person from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the
subordination of such Indebtedness) be (subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement) unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer,
and the respective Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, in each case pursuant to and to the
extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person
other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to
constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) outstanding on the Issue
Date, the related Guarantees, and any related “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor

any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate
the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (5) is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (x) the
greater of (i) €45.0 million and (ii) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA plus (y) additional Indebtedness to the
extent that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (A) the Issuer would have been able to
Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio in the first paragraph
of this covenant after giving _pro forma effect to the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such_
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than
it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer);

installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar
Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate
outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7)(a) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time
outstanding the greater of (x) €45.0 million and (y) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA or (b) obligations
under any Operating Lease;

ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or
obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement,

obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance

Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the
purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); _provided that, in the case of a disposition, the_
maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall

-----

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of €45.0 million and 30%
of Consolidated EBITDA;

(12) Indebtedness Incurred in a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(13) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred

received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, a
Parent Debt Contribution or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than
through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, a Parent Debt Contribution or
an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however,
that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of
making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph
of the covenant described below under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that
are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (13) to the extent the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under
the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;

(14) customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business from customers for

Indebtedness or incurrence of Indebtedness or other transaction, payment or incurrence not prohibited
hereunder (including, without limitation, by way of set-off or exchange), so long as any such
Indebtedness is repaid within 5 Business Days of the date on which such Indebtedness is incurred.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and third paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may
from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and
type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the third paragraph or the first paragraph of this
covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness under the Super Senior Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of
the third paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the third paragraph of
this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (15) of
the third paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

154


-----

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” (x) pro forma effect shall be given to
Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in relation to clause (1) of the third paragraph of this
covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new commitments
are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in
the case of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending
prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available;
and

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of
additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated
as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the
covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any
Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with
original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility,
reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit
Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving
indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was
first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be
Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default
of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated or leverage-based restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a
revolving credit facility; provided that; (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in
a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded
if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent
of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different
currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect
on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or

its Restricted Subsidiaries and that has been guaranteed by, or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of,
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in accordance with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment

If any Investment or Restricted Payment would be permitted pursuant to one or more provisions described above
and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Payment” or “Permitted Investment” (or any
other definition used in this covenant or such definitions), the Issuer may, at its sole discretion, divide and classify such
Investment or Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with this covenant or such definition and may later reclassify
in whole or in part any such Investment or Restricted Payment (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) in whole or in part at any time, so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so reclassified) would
be permitted to be made in reliance on the applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Indenture, in no event shall the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary be permitted to dispose of, or grant an exclusive license to, any Material Intellectual Property,
whether as an asset sale, investment, dividend or otherwise, to any Unrestricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer),
whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom,
which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that
does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the
Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated
Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b), in the
case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

160


-----

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—
_Release of Liens.”_

For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and for the purposes of the definitions of Permitted
Lien and Permitted Collateral Lien, in the event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one of the categories or
exceptions contained in the definition of, as the case may be, “Permitted Lien” or “Permitted Collateral Lien” (or any other
definition used in this covenant or such definitions), as applicable, the Issuer may, at its sole discretion, divide and classify
such Lien in any manner that complies with this covenant or such definition and may later divide and/or reclassify any
such Lien at any time and in any manner that complies with this covenant or such definition.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application
of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness
Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Indenture, the Notes, any Credit Facility (including
the Super Senior Facilities), the Security Documents, any Guarantee and any Intercreditor Agreement
and Additional Intercreditor Agreement or (b) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case of foregoing sub-clauses (a) and (b) in effect at or
entered into on the Issue Date (including the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents or any related security documents); and (in all cases) any amendments, restatements,
modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of any such agreements
or arrangements referred to in this clause (1); provided that such encumbrances and restrictions are not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to dividend and other payment restrictions
than those contained in those agreements as at the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred
as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction
or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer (as defined_
under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person
or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the

161


-----

Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or

lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that
imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all, or substantially all, the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of
the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture or the Super Senior
Facilities Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith, or the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or, with respect to the security documents, the
date on which they are entered into, or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or where the Issuer determines that such
encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect in any material respect the Issuer’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or, an Officer or of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives (including by way of relief from, or
by any Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) for such Asset
Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap)

162


-----

is not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors);
and

(2) except where the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition or series of related
Asset Dispositions consists of:

(a) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the
latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer, nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer and
each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result
of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (D) or (F) in the second paragraph
of this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons

(i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to
exceed €20.0 million(with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset
Disposition received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances described
in clause (H) below) of the later of (i) the date of completion of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Cash
Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the third paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof, (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Notes or Indebtedness
that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment or security to
the Notes, (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral, or (iv) prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case
other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Public Debt
(other than the Notes) pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer either (1) reduces the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes on an equal and ratable basis with any such Indebtedness by purchasing Notes
through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices or (2) makes (at
such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance
with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of
Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to
(y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal
amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

163


-----

(B) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of relevant
record on the record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after
giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D), (E) or
(F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof,

_provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from_
the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the
180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by
that date.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds.”
Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce revolving credit borrowings or other Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that
is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after an
Asset Disposition, or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
€35.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”)
to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies
that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in
the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and
100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing
the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof in the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining
Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders,
collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, the principal amount of such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal
amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset
at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by
the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days
after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will
purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or
purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition

164


-----

Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset
Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
_pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions_
of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition
Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating
that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant.
The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but, in any case, not later than five Business Days after
termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price
of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and
the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating
agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the
Note surrendered; _provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of_
€100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to
the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent
that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or
the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving an aggregate value in excess of €10.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €20.0 million, the terms
of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority
of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
Parent HoldCo, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

165


-----

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or
any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent
HoldCo (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of
such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes
of funding, any agreement, understanding or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date or described
in “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” in the Offering Memorandum, as these
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more
disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (ii) the entry into and performance of any
registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement, the payment of Related Taxes
or any arrangement pursuant to which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent HoldCo is
required or permitted to file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any
consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course
of business, _provided that any such consolidated group arrangement does not permit or require cash_
payment by the Issuer to any Parent HoldCo in excess of the amount of Tax that would be payable by
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including,
without limitation, pursuant to joint venture arrangements), in each case in the ordinary course of
business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination
of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms
no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding; _provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder_
Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable
determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent HoldCo) of management, consulting, monitoring or advisory

(i) €2.5 million and (ii) 1.75% of Consolidated EBITDA in any twelve-month period; (b) payments by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, and including through any Parent HoldCo) for financial advisory,
financing, underwriting, placement services, transaction advice, similar agreements or other services
actually provided to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or in respect of other investment
banking activities (including, in each case, related costs, taxes and expenses), including in connection
with loans, equity, capital market transactions, acquisitions or divestitures, investments or joint ventures,
which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this clause (11) are approved
by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith; and (c) all reasonable out of pocket
costs and expenses incurred by any Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment
in the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding in respect of the
acquisition of shares in the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent such payment would violate
financial assistance restrictions under applicable law);

166


-----

**_Reports_**


(12) any transactions for which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a letter from an
Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial standpoint or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained
in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

(13) investments by any of the Initial Investors in securities of the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Restricted
Subsidiaries (and the payment of reasonable out of pocket expenses of the Initial Investors in connection
therewith) so long as (i) the investment complies with clause (1) of the preceding paragraph, (ii) the
investment is being offered generally to other investors on the same or more favorable terms and (iii) the
investment constitutes less than 10% of the proposed issue amount of such class of securities;

(14) any participation in a public tender or exchange offers for securities or debt instruments issued by the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that are conducted on arms’ length terms and provide for the same price
or exchange ratio, as the case may be, to all holders accepting such tender or exchange offer; and

(15) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing.

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days of the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2024, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, (a) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including
appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as of the end of such fiscal years and the report
of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) an operating and financial review of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operation, consolidated EBITDA
and liquidity and capital resources; (c) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet_
information of the Issuer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include provision of a full income
statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes,
for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of
the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates; provided further that, if
such pro forma financial information is not reasonably available, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (d) a description of material subsequent events
(unless such subsequent events have been described previously in a report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
below); provided that the information described in sub-clause (d) may be provided in the footnotes to the
audited financial statements.

(2) within 60 days of the end of the first, second and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, quarterly financial statements of the Issuer
containing the following information: (a) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet
as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most
recent quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the
comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations, consolidated EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital
resources of the Issuer; (c) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the
Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such
quarterly report relates (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the
extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials); (d) a description of material changes in material debt
instruments since the most recent report; and (e) material subsequent events (to the extent not provided
in a previous report pursuant to clause (1) above or clause (3) below); _provided that the information_
described in clauses (d) and (e) may be provided in the footnotes to such financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change
in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

167


-----

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, within five Business Days after the delivery of each
report discussed in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, conduct a conference call to discuss such
report and the results of operation for the relevant reporting period.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are
not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also post such report
on the Issuer’s website.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports furnished
to the Trustee on a website designated by the Issuer for such purposes and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Authority so require,
make available such reports to the Listing Agent for the purpose of sending to The International Stock Exchange.
Notwithstanding the above, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such reports to the Trustee, the Holders and
prospective holders of the Notes if such reports referenced above in clauses (1), (2) and (3) have been posted on the website
designated by the Issuer for such purposes.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods
presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; _provided,_ _however, that the reports set forth in_
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such
periods. No report needs to include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with
respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering
Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports of any Parent HoldCo.
To the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or results of operations
or financial condition of the Issuer or any Parent HoldCo that is the reporting entity (if applicable), the annual and quarterly
reports shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such material differences. Following an IPO on the
Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent HoldCo or Subsidiary thereof and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on an
internationally recognized stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if
the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange and reports consolidated EBITDA and, if
the IPO Entity is different than the Issuer following such IPO, and material differences exist between the assets, results of
operations or financial condition of the IPO Entity and the Issuer, then the annual and interim reports shall include an
explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such material differences.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary
or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “—Reports” covenant will include (i) a
reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and
results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial
statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, together with an unaudited
reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following
items: revenue, consolidated EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholder equity, capital expenditures
and interest expense.

For the purposes of this covenant, IFRS shall be deemed to be IFRS as in effect from time to time, without giving
effect to the proviso in the definition thereof.

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would
satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or

168


-----

15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of the above reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such
reports will not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information
contained therein, including the Issuer’s or any other parties’ compliance with any of its covenants in the Indenture (as to
which the Trustee will be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates that are delivered).

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom or the United
States of America, any state, commonwealth or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer)
will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction
as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be able to Incur
at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio contained in
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee),
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken
in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been
Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held
by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer
on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer
under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be
released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

169


-----

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of such
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the
Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with paragraphs (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance
rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable
jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) a Guarantor
from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor;
(iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of
such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable,
and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (iv) a Permitted Reorganization
and (v) the Issuer or a Guarantor changing legal domicile or legal form or consolidating into or merging or combining with
an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such
entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; _provided,_ _however, that clauses (1), (2) and_
(4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (3)(a) and (3)(b) under the heading “—Guarantors,” as the case may be,
shall apply to any such transaction.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If, on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such
time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the
Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

170


-----

(5) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(6) “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; and

(8) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions
of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no
action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the_
continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the
Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (4)(b) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the
Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an
Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in
anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Holders
of the Notes that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such
notification shall be a condition for the suspension or reversion of the covenants described under this caption to be effective.
The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify the Holders of such event. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever
achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to
take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it
being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any
Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described
in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral
Liens and may effect a Permitted Reorganization, and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken, and the
applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified,
replaced or released, if applicable, in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released, from time to time to cure any
ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i) above, except
with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, if applicable, or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either (1) a solvency
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent from an Independent Financial
Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such
Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created
under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are
valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement.

-----

In the event that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments
without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Future Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Super Senior Facilities, any other Indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal
amount in excess of €15.0 million or any other Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and
delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee,
which Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness;
_provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for_
so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance
rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable
jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may
contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary.

Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Release of the Guarantees.”
A Guarantee of a Guarantor granted pursuant to this “—Future Guarantees” covenant may also be released at the option of
the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred
after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not
been designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after
the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if
such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such
grant would be restricted by general statutory and other legal limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, equity subordination, fraudulent preference, interest tripping, controlled foreign corporation, tax
restrictions, capital maintenance, transfer pricing, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.
By virtue of such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may effectively have no obligation under its Guarantee.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” in the Offering_
Memorandum.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon (i) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge” or (ii) the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the_
Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

(4) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged

172


-----

from its liability with respect to the Super Senior Facilities and is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees”;

(5) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described in the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees”;

(8) pursuant to a Permitted Reorganization or as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and
_Consolidation—Guarantors”; or_

(9) upon the solvent liquidation or winding-up of a Guarantor.

At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases
set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer will
be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the_
Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or
other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement
(or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to
release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interest; _provided that such Additional Intercreditor_
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee
or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be
Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal
and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral
Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material
respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on
the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the
Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments.”_

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then
entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and

173


-----

the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; _provided that if at any time the Issuer_
determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such
Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Lines of Business_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Similar
Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Limitation on Issuer Activities_**

The Issuer shall not trade, carry on any business, own any assets, Incur any liabilities or grant any Lien other than:

long as in any case such further transfer is made promptly; and

(20) activities reasonably incidental to the foregoing, activities substantially consistent with activities

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection with
any acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, joint venture, investment, incurrence, payment or other similar
transaction where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or payment or incurrence (including in respect
of incurrence, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment of Indebtedness as well as the making of
Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or
Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the binding or definitive agreements for such acquisition,
disposition, merger, amalgamation, joint venture, investment, commitment, payment, transaction, event or other similar
transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, joint venture, investment, indebtedness, payment or similar transaction and
the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the

175


-----

ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For
the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio
(including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or arrangement, such baskets or ratios will
not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the relevant
transaction or arrangement and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be
tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or arrangement or related transactions; provided that if the Issuer
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including
any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after
the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction or arrangement.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period, a
twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(1) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (a) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between
the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used
or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or
(b) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and
the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such
corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(2) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (1)(a) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during
such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (a) first, against the Carry
Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period
prior to any increase in accordance with clause (1)(a) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back
Amount.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note issued under the Indenture when
due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice by
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other
agreements contained in the Indenture (other than a default in performance, or breach, of a covenant or
agreement which is specifically addressed in clauses (1) or (2) above);

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, aggregates €25.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial

176


-----

statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €25.0 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final
(the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value
in excess of €15.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such
security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in
writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each case) any such Default
continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial
proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and (in
each case) any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clause (3), (4) or (6) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and,
with respect to such clauses the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in such clauses, as applicable,
of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the
Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare
the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and
payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable
immediately. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of
any event which is in fact such a default is received by a responsible officer of the Trustee at the corporate trust office of
the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the
Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) above shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders
of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within
30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default,
except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of
the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration
or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or
existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received,

177


-----

indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes, unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee
will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its
own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security
(including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking
or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor
compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a
responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of such occurrence
by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer.
Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is
aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report
or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled
“Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or
certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible
for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be
unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default
or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding
principal amount of the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

178


-----

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may
be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect
to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder, unless the Issuer or
the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security Documents;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under their Guarantees or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement any
applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

In addition, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of
the Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder release any Guarantor (other than all or substantially all Guarantors) from any of its obligations under its Guarantee
or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under “Change of
_Control,” “—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants in effect at the time of such action,_
shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or
interest on, the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer, or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

179


-----

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Future
_Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the_
Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or
Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with
respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is
provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision
of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Guarantee, the Security Documents
or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Super Senior Facilities, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the Super Senior Facilities (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for
the benefit of any Person; _provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the_
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clauses (3) or (6) above to add a Guarantor
under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional
Guarantor to be duly executed by the Issuer, such additional Guarantor and the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted
by the Indenture to be made without the consent of any Holder need only be duly executed by the Issuer and the Trustee.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A
consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or
under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations,
including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee
and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration
of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the
Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time
will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”)
and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default”
above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy

180


-----

provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision
and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option
with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in
clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or
euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain
other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably
require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to
surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when: (1) either: (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen
or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have
been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their
Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of
the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the
Trustee for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as
applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to
the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes
that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has
paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions
to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the
effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, _provided that any such counsel may rely on any_
Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or
pursuant to the applicable Officers’ Certificate, the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose),
shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be;
_provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier_
payment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment

181


-----

to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above shall not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, additional break cost or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by
a Global Note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry
Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written
notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically
in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received
written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested
in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer,
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as
security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Note, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the
Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as
Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes, expenses
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited and the rules of
The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be published, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, on the official website of The International Stock Exchange Authority
Limited (www.tisegroup.com/). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders
of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

All notices to Holders of the Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the
register of Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; _provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice_
shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice
or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall
be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to
a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is
given in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. For so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream in lieu of
notice via registered mail.

182


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for
the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received or
recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in
respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or
such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that
purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note,
the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a
result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several
basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima
facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations,
will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of
a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite
any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any
Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is
Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange. There can be
no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange will be approved
and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than the assets of Kelvion, Inc. and Kelvion
Products, Inc.) are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer and such
Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any,
and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees, may not be collectable
within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the
Issuer will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan
in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The application of the
provisions of articles 470-1 to 470-19 of the Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended,
is hereby expressly excluded.

accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to
the Bund Rate at such redemption date plus 50 basis points, and assuming that the rate of interest
on the Notes for the period from the redemption date through    , 2025 will equal the rate of
interest on the Notes in effect on the date on which the applicable notice of redemption is given;
over

(b) the outstanding principal amount of such Note, as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the
Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate.

_forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer_
and may include the full run rate effect of cost savings and synergies which are reasonably anticipated to
be realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as if they had occurred on
the first day of the reference period; provided that, if definitive documentation has been entered into with
respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder,
Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase
(including the full run rate effect of cost savings and synergies which are reasonably anticipated to be
realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation) as if such Purchase had
occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the
date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business
or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be
excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into
account the full run rate effect of cost savings and synergies which are reasonably anticipated to be
realized within the next 24 months following the date of such calculation, resulting from any such
disposal, as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer);

(3) the Indebtedness attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and
operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership
interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if
such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving
rise to such Indebtedness will not be obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any
Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of
the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be determined in accordance with IFRS.

anticipated cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements, expenses, synergies
or similar initiatives which are reasonably anticipated to be realized within the next 24 months following the date of such

financial or accounting officer of the Issuer) of cost savings programs and synergies that have been or will be initiated by

the date of such calculation as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating
improvements, expenses, synergies or similar initiatives had been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant period,
_provided that such anticipated cost savings, operating expense reductions, restructuring charges, operating improvements,_
expenses, synergies or similar initiatives (i) are not duplicative of cost savings and synergies already included in such

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations regarding the European Union, Germany,_
_the United Kingdom, Poland and Luxembourg and a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of_
_the security interests for the Notes. The descriptions below are only a summary and do not purport to be complete or to_
_discuss all insolvency law considerations that may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or any_
_Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral.” Prospective investors in_
_the Notes should consult their own legal advisers with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings opened in respect of a company whose “centre
of main interests” is located in a member state of the European Union (the “Member State”) (other than Denmark).

**_Main Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) within which the
center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The “centre of main interests” is defined as “the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” Pursuant to
Article 3(1) paragraph 2 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the centre of main interests of a company or legal person is
presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption
shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to
the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where
the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other
Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor
conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the centre of main interests, this may require informing
the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention
to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other
appropriate means).

If the “centre of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member
State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the
territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any
action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

**_Secondary Insolvency Proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in
the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other Member States.
If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or
“territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other
Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency
Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect,
secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually
convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of
operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main
insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial
proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which
the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be
opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot

217


-----

be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law;
or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection
with the operation of such establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the
respective Member State’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be
governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the_
respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court of the
main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State
(such as to remove the debtor’s assets from the territory of the Member State in which they are situated), subject to certain
limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure
has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
company has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral
undertaking with respect to the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be
opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights
under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in
the Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a
qualified majority of local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is
binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the
request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied
that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 (3) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court,
at the request of the insolvency practitioner or the debtor in possession in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the
opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are
in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner
in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no
interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. In
the case where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in
the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be
required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any
creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency, administration
and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different
from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved
jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**_Insolvency Proceedings Involving Members of a Group of Companies_**

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that
insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency practitioners
appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in
proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court
which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective
administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of
interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with
the rules applicable to them.

**Luxembourg**

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment from the Issuer under the Notes and
under the guarantees given by the Luxembourg Guarantors (together with the Issuer, the “Luxembourg Obligors”) may
be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of
proceedings (together referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be initiated against a Luxembourg Obligor, as a
company incorporated in Luxembourg having its centre of main interests (within the meaning of EU Insolvency Regulation
or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of main interests is located in a jurisdiction
where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable):

      - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by any Luxembourg Obligor,
by any of its creditors or by the Luxembourg district court (tribunal d’arrondissement siégeant en matière
_commerciale) (the “Luxembourg Court”) ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg Court_
having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg Obligor (i) is in a state of
cessation of payment (cessation des paiement) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness
(ébranlement de crédit). Save in case of suspension of such obligation following (i) the application for
reorganization proceedings, or (ii) any applicable stay measures, with respect to a Luxembourg Obligor
under the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act (as defined below), the managers or directors of
the relevant Luxembourg Obligor have the obligation to file for bankruptcy within one month in case it
is in a state of cessation of payment (cessation de paiement). The main effects of such proceedings are
the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account
their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the relevant
Luxembourg Obligor, subject to certain limited exceptions under the applicable provisions of the
Financial Collateral Law 2005, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured
creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or
directors of a Luxembourg Obligor that ceases its payments (i.e., is unable to pay its debts as they fall
due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of such
Luxembourg Obligor’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk
of the district court of such Luxembourg Obligor’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to
comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third-parties on the
basis of principles of managers’ and directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for
simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with Article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial
code (code de commerce); or

      - the following proceedings which were introduced by the Luxembourg law of 7 August 2023 on the
preservation of businesses and modernising bankruptcy law, implementing Directive EU 2019/1023 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt (the
“Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act”) which entered into force on 1[st] November 2023;

           - a preventive reorganisation procedure, such as conservatory measures (notably the
appointment of a conciliator);

           - an out-of-court reorganisation procedure by mutual agreement (réorganisation par
_accord amiable) whereby any Luxembourg Obligor and at least two of its creditors_
mutually agree to reorganize all or part of the assets, or the business, of the relevant
Luxembourg Obligor which agreement can be validated by the Luxembourg Court upon
request of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor; and

           - any of three types of judicial reorganisation proceedings depending on the objective of
the procedure (noting that a judicial reorganization proceeding can pursue a specific
objective for each activity):

               - obtaining a stay of proceedings (sursis) to conclude an amicable agreement
(accord amiable) within the reorganization by amicable agreement;

               - obtaining the creditors’ consent on a reorganization plan to reach a collective
agreement (réorganisation judiciaire par accord collectif), which is deemed to
have been approved by the creditors entitled to vote if it receives, in each
category of creditors, a favorable vote from a majority of the creditors within a
category, representing at least half of all sums due in that category. Such plan,
if approved by the court, is binding on all creditors. However, if rejected, the
court can still approve the plan (in case rejected by such creditors) (cram-down)
if (i) the plan has been approved by at least one category of creditors entitled to

219


-----

vote, (ii) it is approved by ordinary creditors only, then the plan must ensure that
extraordinary creditors are treated more favorably, and (iii) no category can
receive or keep more than the total amount of its claims; or

               - the transfer, by a court decision, of all or part of any Luxembourg Obligor’s
assets or business, whereby all or part of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor’s
assets or business will be transferred to one or more third parties, which can be
initiated either by that Luxembourg Obligor or by the state prosecutor.

When a reorganization procedure is opened, a stay (sursis) on payments for a maximum of four months begins,
also with possible extensions of up to a total of 12 months. Existing agreements and financial arrangements are still
enforceable (with exceptions, not applicable to employment agreements) – financial collateral arrangements, set-off or
netting arrangements under the Financial Collateral Law 2005 and professional payment guarantees remain enforceable
and unaffected by a judicial reorganization procedure, thus continuing to benefit creditors. Ongoing contracts will also
continue. Payments are effective against third parties and new liabilities are considered as being debts of the insolvency
estate.

As from the entry into force of the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act (i.e., 1[st] November 2023), the
previous existing procedures of preventive composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite) and controlled
management proceedings (gestion contrôlée) have been repealed are no longer be available under Luxembourg law (except
for proceedings already opened, which will continue to be governed by these provisions).

In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment under the Notes issued by the Issuer and the
guarantees given by the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg Court to grant a stay on
payment (sursis de paiement) or to put that Luxembourg Obligor into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) or by an
administrative dissolution without liquidation (dissolution administrative sans liquidation).

      - Judicial liquidation: judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public
prosecutor against any Luxembourg Obligor pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in
serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg laws governing
commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar
rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

      - Suspension of payment proceedings: a suspension of payment (sursis de paiement) can only be applied
to a Luxembourg Obligor which, as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily
cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets to pay all amounts due
to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even
though showing a loss, presents serious elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and
its debts. The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a Luxembourg Obligor
experiencing financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding
involving both the Luxembourg Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority
of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor's debts
(excluding claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)). The
suspension of payment is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it has
lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the relevant
Luxembourg Obligor prior to obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and
other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned.
During the suspension of payment, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against the
relevant Luxembourg Obligor, or its assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred
creditors, or to creditors which are secured by mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial
collateral arrangements governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. The relevant Luxembourg
Obligor continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a court-appointed administrator
who must approve most of the transactions carried out by the applicant. When a suspension of payments
ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the relevant Luxembourg Obligor's managers can run
the business again.

      - Administrative dissolution without liquidation: an administrative dissolution without liquidation
(dissolution administrative sans liquidation) proceeding may be opened by the manager of the
Luxembourg Register of Commerce and Companies (Registre de Commerce et des Sociétés,
_Luxembourg) at the request of the public prosecutor against any Luxembourg Obligor that will complete_
and result in the dissolution of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor if the following three cumulative
conditions are met: (i) the relevant Luxembourg Obligor must have no assets, (ii) the relevant
Luxembourg Obligor must have no employees and (iii) the relevant Luxembourg Obligor must pursue
activities contrary to criminal law or which seriously contravene the provisions of the Luxembourg

220


-----

commercial code or the laws governing commercial companies, including the right of establishment. The
administrative dissolution procedure without liquidation is closed at the latest six (6) months after the
publication of the opening decision.

Liability of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantors in respect of the relevant Notes or Guarantees, as
applicable, will, in the event of a liquidation of the relevant Luxembourg Obligor following bankruptcy or judicial
liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include,
among others:

      - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the
minimum social salary);

      - employees’ contributions to social security;

      - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg direct tax authorities (Administration des contributions
_directes);_

      - employer’s contribution to social security;

      - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005;

      - chamber of commerce contribution; and

      - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

_Impact of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings on transactions_

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by any Luxembourg
Obligor during the hardening period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months, as from the date on which the
Luxembourg Court formally adjudicates a Luxembourg Obligor bankrupt and, as for specific payments and transactions,
during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period, preceding the judgment declaring
bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if
the bankruptcy judgment was preceeded by another insolvency proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payment) under
Luxembourg law. In particular:

      - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de commerce), specified
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect
of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment
of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale,
netting, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other
than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially
inadequate consideration) entered into during the hardening period (or the ten days preceding it) must be
set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

      - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well
as other transactions concluded for consideration during the hardening period are subject to cancellation
by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the
knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments such hardening period rule does not apply for
financial collateral arrangements, netting and set-off arrangements subject to the Financial Collateral
Law 2005, and

      - pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and Article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil
code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to
challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to
defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg District Court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its

221


-----

solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may
choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of
adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue _vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency_
proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on any Luxembourg Obligor’s business and assets or that
Luxembourg Obligor’s obligations under the Notes, security interests (save for financial collateral arrangements within the
meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005) or the Guarantees, as applicable.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy or bankruptcy reorganization may be subject to the EU
Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency
Regulation applies will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the
applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors
(subject to the application of Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 and Article 16 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation).

**_Luxembourg Collateral Considerations_**

The Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that with the exception of the provisions on over-indebtedness
_(surendettement) (which only apply to natural persons), the national or foreign provisions governing reorganization_
measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not applicable to financial collateral
arrangements (such as Luxembourg pledges over shares or receivables) and shall not constitute an obstacle to the
enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations. Certain preferred creditors of a Luxembourg Obligor
(including the Luxembourg tax, social security and other authorities) may have a privilege that ranks senior to the rights of
the secured or unsecured creditors.

The appointment of a foreign security agent or trustee will be recognized under Luxembourg law (i) to the extent
that such designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending
on the type of the security right. In general, a security right over financial collateral may be granted in favor of an agent, a
fiduciary or a trustee acting as holder of the security right for the collateral taker in order to secure the claims of present or
future third party secured creditors, provided that these secured creditors are identified or can be identified. Without
prejudice to its obligations vis-à-vis such third party secured creditors, an agent, a fiduciary or a trustee acting for these
secured creditors is entitled to the same rights as a secured creditor who is directly holding a security right granted to its
benefit, all in accordance with article 2(4) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005.

Foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid
and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security
interests are similar in nature to Luxembourg security interests falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law
2005. In such situation, Luxembourg hardening period (période suspecte) rules are disapplied (save for the case of fraud).

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in
respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements, which are not expressly
recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by
the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the Luxembourg security
grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have
jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency
proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security
interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency
Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Where judicial reorganization proceedings under the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act have been
opened in respect of the debtor of the secured debt, the relevant creditors of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantors
may, under certain very limited circumstances, be temporarily suspended from accelerating the secured debt in accordance
with Article 30 of the Luxembourg Insolvency Modernization Act and hence face a situation where enforcing their security
rights under the Collateral might be delayed.

The perfection of the security interests does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or
execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created to satisfy their unpaid claims against the
pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the
beneficiaries of the security interest will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to
preferred rights by operation of law). Attachments will not apply to or have in impact on financial collateral arrangements
subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005.

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by
operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured
creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes in particular the rights relating

222


-----

to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary,
and the rights of the treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend
to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of
a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.

**_Luxembourg Guarantee Considerations_**

The Luxembourg Companies Law does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg Guarantor to
guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A Luxembourg Guarantor may give a Guarantee provided
the giving of the Guarantee is covered by that Luxembourg Guarantor’s corporate purpose, corporate benefit and is in the
best interest of the company.

Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate
benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the Luxembourg Guarantor derives a direct or
indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is
proportionate to the burden of the assistance. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest
of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the interest of the group, and that the existence of a
group interest can in certain cases result in the Guarantee being held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not
established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the
interest of the assisting company.

However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the Luxembourg
Guarantor (i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the Luxembourg Guarantor's own funds (capitaux propres)),
the Luxembourg Guarantor must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of
all the affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed
at a common objective. As a result, the Guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg Guarantor may be subject
to limitations in order to ensure their enforceability. Further, a Guarantee or security interest that substantially exceeds the
Luxembourg Guarantor's ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the Guarantee/security provider and to its other
creditors, or from which the Luxembourg Guarantor derives no or very limited direct benefit in return, or where no direct
or indirect consideration is granted to the company in exchange, would expose its directors or managers to personal liability.

In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg Guarantor,
in extreme circumstances the Guarantee or security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary
to public policy (ordre public), in the case of facts consisting of a misuse of corporate assets. Any up-stream or crossstream Guarantee or security granted in connection with the Notes by the Luxembourg Guarantor will be limited to a certain
percentage of, among others, the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds and subordinated debt.

Kelvion Holding GmbH, Kelvion Germany GmbH, Kelvion Thermal Solutions Holding GmbH, Mangrove GermanCo I
GmbH, Mangrove GermanCo II GmbH and Kelvion PHE GmbH, as Guarantors, are organized under the laws of Germany,
have their registered offices in Germany and, except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of
their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of these certain Guarantors, insolvency proceedings are
likely to be initiated in Germany if these Guarantors were held to have their “centre of main interests” (as such term is
described in Article 3 (1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation within the territory of Germany at the time the application for
the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed (each a “German Domiciled Entity”) and
German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings
may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under
German law (for example, if the centre of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency
over the Issuer or such German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions.

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interest as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions with
which you may be familiar, including, _inter alia, with respect to priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain_
post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes and the
Guarantees by a German Domiciled Entity to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept. This generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding
for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these

223


-----

insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In
particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no
pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. The German legislator has adopted an act to facilitate the
handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) (the “Group
**Insolvency Act”), but this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of**
group companies. The Group Insolvency Act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the
insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or a pooling of claims
among the respective entities of a group. However, the German Insolvency Code provides for certain mechanisms designed
to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity
insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is
facilitated (without any obligation of the court to do so); (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency
courts, insolvency administrators and creditor’' committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for coordination proceedings
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a coordination insolvency administrator (Koordinationsverwalter) with
the ability to propose a coordination plan (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court
(Koordinationsgericht).

In the case of European Union cross-border group insolvencies, Articles 56 et seq. of the EU Insolvency
Regulation introduced obligations for communication and cooperation between the administrators and courts involved. In
addition, a coordination procedure can be initiated which enables the appointment of a coordinator and the elaboration of
a cross-border coordination plan.

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex_
_officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency_
proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the
debtor (i.e., where its liabilities exceed the value of its assets) unless the debtor’s business is predominantly likely to
continue as a going concern (positive Fortführungsprognose) or in the event of illiquidity, i.e., that the debtor is unable to
pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on
their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend
_wahrscheinlich) for the current and the subsequent fiscal year (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor_
is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks,
unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed
acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft, “AG”), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a company
with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or any company not having an individual as
personally liable shareholder or partner becomes illiquid or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under
certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay,
however, at the latest within three weeks in the case of illiquidity and within six weeks in the case of over-indebtedness
occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes the management to both severe damage claims as well as
sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under
the Notes or the Guarantees, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid
insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payment obligations but
will presumably not be able to do so. A debtor is not considered over indebted even when its liabilities exceed the value of
its assets if, given the circumstances, it is more likely than not that the debtor’s business can survive as a going concern. In
addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings
in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e., if there is the imminent risk of the company being
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time within a certain prognosis period, whereas imminent
illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted (Überschuldung)
it may also file for preliminary debtor in possession moratorium proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless - from a thirdparty perspective - there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring (negative Fortführungsprognose). Upon
such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement
measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as
custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible
to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). The court may also implement other preliminary
measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor
shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal debtor in possession proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

During the debtor-in-possession proceedings it also has to be ensured that the debtor is willing and able to adapt
its management to the interests of the creditors. Therefore, German insolvency law requires debtor-in-possession planning
as a filing condition. The debtor-in-possession plan consists of the following components:

224


-----

      - a financial plan for the period of six months, confirming that the costs of the proceedings will be covered
in addition to the costs of continuing business operations. The plan must also set out the sources of
financing;

      - a concept for the implementation of the debtor-in-possession proceedings, in which in particular the
extent and causes of the crisis are analyzed and necessary measures for overcoming it are determined;

      - a report on the status of negotiations with creditors, shareholders and third parties;

      - a description of the precautions taken by the debtor to fulfil its obligations under insolvency law; and

      - a substantiated description of the additional or reduced costs of debtor-in-possession proceedings
compared to regular insolvency proceedings. (Prognostic) advisor and court costs must also be taken into
account.

The depth of the presentation and the degree of detail are to be determined in each individual case and depend on
the size and the specific circumstances of the debtor.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary
measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual
claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective measures are reasonable
to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court
will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs
by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties_
of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the
debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision
of the court, the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency
administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the
debtor and other measures the court sees as appropriate.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’
committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements:

    - balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted);

    - revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the
filing; and/or

    - fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis.

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the
preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter)_ or an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for debtor in possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung); and
appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorläufiger) Sachwalter).

If the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is
binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible, i.e., incompetent and/or not impartial). To ensure that
the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does include
a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the
employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the
debtor’s assets (which may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an
insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings.

The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the
debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and (ii) if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the cost of
the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency

225


-----

court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the
absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for
insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has ordered debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will
only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the
insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative
and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The
insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency
administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring
that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed
individual to become the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, _i.e.,_
sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in
possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to
continue the debtor’s operations. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential debts
of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten), which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the
residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying
as unsecured insolvency claim).

The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency
creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings.

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of
formal insolvency proceedings against any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject
to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

    - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose
of the assets of any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to
the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

    - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to any German
Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of any German
Domiciled Entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

    - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in
the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of any
German Domiciled Entity’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of
the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings;

    - claims against any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in
accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

    - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one
party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency
proceedings with respect to the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of
insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be ruled invalid by a German
court if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht
_des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate_
to agreements that are not governed by German law.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency
estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht), wishing to assert claims against the
insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately,
but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).
Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an
automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to
enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors
have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to

226


-----

enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be
noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his, her or the debtor’s
possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security
transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen). The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) has decided that the secured creditor
is entitled to initiate enforcement of preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) with respect to IP pledges (and general view
of legal literature is that this shall also be the case for pledges over shares or company interests) forming part of the
insolvency estate. In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less
certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the
secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus
value added tax (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount
equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to
satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as
well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings).
Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims — _Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency_
creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any),
will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse)
after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Therefore, the
proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured
creditors of any German Guarantor in full after secured creditors (if any) have been satisfied. Claims of subordinated
creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other nonsubordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however,
compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims
to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant
debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the
insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured
creditors. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the
relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the relevant
debtor, guarantor or grantor of security. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, guarantor
or grantor of security, the claims against such debtor, guarantor or grantor of security would be treated as a subordinated
insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third
party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans (section 135 of the German
Insolvency Code) will itself be exposed to a claw-back risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the
period of one year. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in insolvency proceedings over the assets
of the debtor (or in any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission
allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed
by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a subordinated creditor, potential
sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a
shortfall on the amount they recover. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige
_Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured_
insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under “Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.”

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of a Domiciled Entity’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’
assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of such German Domiciled Entity’s
business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an
insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of such German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant
subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the
insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can under certain circumstances be crammed down).
If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included
in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a
debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an
insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate
such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile
(offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor
business (Schutzschirm). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may — upon application of the filing
debtor — be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to
supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion

227


-----

being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is
obviously not competent or impartial).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until
the insolvency administrators opt for performance.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfers_**

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings,
the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency
creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods.
Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian,
as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have
to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any German Domiciled Entity or any of their relevant
subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well
as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential
challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness
(Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is
successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the
Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If
payments have already been made under the Notes, the Guarantees or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction
that had been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the
Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes or the Guarantees, as applicable, without preference in
insolvency proceedings.

Against this background, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes
the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor
may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following cases:

    - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken
and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was
illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the
creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively
suggesting such illiquidity or filing), whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been
aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

    - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form in which
or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken
during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such
filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor
was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that
such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that
imperatively suggest such detrimental effect), whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to
have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors;

    - any legal transaction effected by the debtor that directly disadvantages the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against the debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, provided that it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the
filing of the petition of the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such
transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (or of circumstances that
imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings and the other party to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s
illiquidity or such filing (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing) at the time of
the transaction, whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s
illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

228


-----

    - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party
debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the
four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

    - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its
insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such
intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain,
security or satisfaction for a debt, the hardening period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary
of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently
illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case
the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a
time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed
if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the
relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the
debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being
illiquid at this time;

    - any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and a related party
(nahestehende _Person) which directly disadvantages the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was_
concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as at the time the
contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain
limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning
more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give
them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses
relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

    - any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision
of security (Sicherung), the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction (Befriedigung),
the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition.

    - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third
party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable
as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for
the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency
creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency
creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction
prejudiced the debtor’s creditors, provided that, if the relevant act by the debtor consisted of a settlement of an obligation
or the grant of a security which was due to be paid or granted, as the case may be, then the knowledge of the debtor’s
intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors is only presumed if the other party was aware of the actual illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor and of the fact that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an
“affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and
may as such be privileged _i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under the German_
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg).

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right
according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites
vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor
exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

A creditor of a German Domiciled Entity who benefits from a transaction that constitutes (or is considered to be)
a repayment of the registered share capital of a German Domiciled Entity could, moreover, become personally liable for
damages under exceptional circumstances such as if the creditor were to act, in collusion with such German Domiciled
Entity (kollusives Zusammenwirken), with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of
the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit).

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor
on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other
claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with
equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening
of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the
proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal
consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous
performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims
resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or any of its
subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the respective loan or legal transaction
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to ensure
that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial distress to solve
their problems at an early stage and to avoid insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European Parliament and the Council
EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive
(EU) 2017/1132 (“Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of
the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law
is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (“Corporate Stabilization
**and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-insolvency financial**
restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring
**Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent**
restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens).

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the
occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor
will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor’s
management may (but is not obliged to) alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the company is imminently
illiquid (see above). The restructuring tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act are not available in
case the debtor is already illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) and/or at the same time over-indebted (überschuldet) and obliged to
file for insolvency.

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities
(with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort),
only certain types (for example, financial liabilities, including the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and
depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum. The
tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be
used for each entity separately, however certain tools may be extended to cover security granted by entities that are
connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor.

The core component of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-insolvency restructuring of
the debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), including, for example, by way of changes to the
principal amounts, interest rates, maturities of liabilities or covenants. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact
(including, for example, a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries
and parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon
being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan, which can be
submitted solely by the debtor, will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle,
that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined

230


-----

by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the
subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted
and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, _provided certain requirements are met_
and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so
as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization
order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict
enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of
up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to
certain conditions being satisfied.

For the noteholders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Domiciled Entity would be the following:

      - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only
limited review or supervision by a court;

      - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up
to eight months due to a stabilization order;

      - any claims and rights of the Noteholder can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the
restructuring plan (for example, in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or
a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of
the security right);

      - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring
Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

      - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Noteholder
without the consent of each Noteholder (generally, the relevant majority requirement is 75% of the
respective principal amount) and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even
without the consent of any of the Noteholders.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any
Member State pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation upon such proceeding being included as a recognized
proceeding in Exhibit A of that regulation. However, this does not apply to plans in non-public restructuring matters under
the Corporate Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to
certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Security Interests_**

_GmbH – Limitation Language_

The granting of guarantees by German Guarantors will be subject to certain provisions of the German Act
regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (the
“GmbHG”) if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a German limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a German limited partnership with a German limited liability
company as general partner (“GmbH & Co. KG”).

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its
assets to its direct or indirect shareholders (or the subsidiaries of such direct or indirect shareholders) to the extent that the
amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets less liabilities and liability reserves) - or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its
general partner’s net assets - is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). Guarantees or
security interests granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or
sister company are considered disbursements under sections 30 and 31 GmbHG. Moreover, under section 15b(1) in
connection with paragraph 5 German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) members of the representative body and
liquidators of a legal person who are subject to the obligation to file an application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (antragspflichtige Mitglieder des Vertretungsorgans und Abwickler einer juristischen Person), _e.g., a_
managing director (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH, can be held personally liable in certain circumstances for payments to
shareholders that would render the GmbH illiquid. The granting of guarantees and security interests for the benefit of direct
or indirect parent or sister companies of the GmbH could be considered as such disbursements and payments to
shareholders. In relation to a GmbH & Co. KG the capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules and principles
described above for GmbHs apply, mutatis mutandis, also to the general partners of the GmbH & Co. KGs.

231


-----

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to provide security interests to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating German capital maintenance and/or
liquidity maintenance rules and to limit any potential personal liability of the management, it is standard market practice
for notes, credit agreements, indentures, related guarantees and related security documents to contain so-called “limitation
language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant
to such “limitation language,” the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security
interests against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—
or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of,
its stated share capital and thereby violating sections 30 and 31 GmbHG.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Indenture and security documents will contain a limitation
language substantially in the form as follows. Pursuant to such limitation language the beneficiaries of any guarantee and/or
security interests agree to enforce against a German Guarantor and/or security grantor which is a GmbH, GmbH & Co.
KG, AG, or AG & Co. KG only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of sections 57, 71 a AktG
(in relation to an AG and an AG & Co. KG) or sections 30 and 31 GmbHG (in relation to a GmbH and GmbH & Co. KG),
respectively. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such Guarantor cannot be enforced
at all.

**_General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_**

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law
The Issuer cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German
Guarantors constituted in the form of, as applicable, a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a GmbH or
a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantor to make payment on the Notes or of
the German Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the related guarantees or the enforceability of the Guarantees,
the Indenture and the security documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder
deprives its company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with
respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interests granted by a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of
proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious
inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates
that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot
be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees and/or security interests
to be granted by any of the German Guarantors (including in the legal form of a German stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft).

Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated
share capital of the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of such guarantee
or security interest) could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of
detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores
(Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances
indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason
to enquire further with respect thereto.

**_Security Interests/Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and are
strictly linked to the existence, the extent and the enforceability of the secured claims and require the security holder and
the creditor of the secured claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will
automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently,
but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be
granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest.

The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a
creditor under the Notes. The holders of the Notes on the other hand are creditors under the Notes and the Guarantees. In
order to allow the holders of the Notes to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so-called “parallel debt”
obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the holders’ claims
under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment with respect
to the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment with respect to the parallel

232


-----

debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel
debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept of creating
parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept
will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of
pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear certain risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Security Agent as the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security
Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is
no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence, the secured
claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of
the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the
collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements
apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to
prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting
the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to
their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to
intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**Netherlands**

There are three applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations: (a)
suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and
enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, (b) a private composition (onderhands akkoord), which is also intended
to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern and (c) bankruptcy
(faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the
most commonly used insolvency regime and may result in the transfer of parts of the Dutch Guarantor as a going concern.
A suspension of payments almost always results in the debtor’s bankruptcy. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the
Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out
below.

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable
to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant
a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is
required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments, but it will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority
(i.e., more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than
one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential creditors
declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments
or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the near future.

The fact that the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices
that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework
of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two
months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, a suspension of payments will only
affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s
consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a
suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at
least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be
due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of
payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior
approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude
the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie)
can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch
bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated, and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors
according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority,
in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights.
Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension of payments or
bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be
subject to the following:

233


-----

(a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed
by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the
similar statutory stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied
during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of
payment; (b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as
determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be
entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation
costs; and excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset against an
unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are
generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against the
Dutch Guarantor would allow secured creditors (and in case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors
(including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets that secure their
claims as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two
months, extendable by another period of up to two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred
creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on
assets of the bankrupt entity. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt entity’s assets.
Restrictions on the enforcement of guarantees and security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must
be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of
security rights and other rights as described above may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured
creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time. If such time is not met, the receiver will be
entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds,
meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of
any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be off set against an unsecured claim of the secured
creditor. Such set off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the
case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Any pending executions of judgments
against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension of payments is granted and terminate by
operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect
upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the
declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination.
Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

Under Dutch law, bankruptcy and suspension of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of the
judgment of the bankruptcy or the suspension of payments. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a
composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential
creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the
creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted,
and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit
the ability of the holders of the notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of notes in a Dutch
suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or
bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

All unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings
in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. As a general rule, claims of
unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy to be verified. If the
bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been submitted for verification within the deadline set
therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification”
under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes
is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured and non-preferential pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to
the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s
existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings for voting.

In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be
referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed
claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes.
These procedures could cause holders of notes to recover less than the principal amount of their notes or less than they
could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of notes
to be delayed. Interest on the notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge
or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the
proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of
unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to
certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject to the security or

234


-----

their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same
rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation
of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right
relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for
verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim
may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified.

As regards, the private composition regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility to offer composition
outside of formal insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet
_homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”). The private_
composition regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition under
the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as
shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross-class
cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination
of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims
against the Dutch Guarantor being compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class
vote in favor of such a composition. A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring
Plans can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the
Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of the
trustee and/or the holders of the notes under the indentures and therefore the notes.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, voting on a composition plan is done
in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two-thirds of the claims of that class that
have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two-thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the
plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition
plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (a “cross-class cramdown”). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a
class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan,
unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the
basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives
under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a
request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from
the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on
enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. During such period, inter alia, all
enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce
security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the
debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge. In the event that the Dutch Guarantor experiences financial difficulty,
it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations of the Dutch Guarantor.

Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may be affected by (a) the standards of reasonableness
and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and
unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden); and (c) the other general defenses available to debtors under
Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the notes. The validity and enforceability of the
obligations of the Dutch Guarantor under the notes may be successfully contested by the Dutch Guarantor (or its
administrator (bewindvoerder) in suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra
vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor do not fall within the scope of the
objects clause as set out in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company’s counterparty
knew or ought to have known (without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the
objects and purposes of the Dutch Guarantor, a court will consider (i) the text of the objects clause in the company’s articles
of association and (ii) all relevant circumstances including whether the granting of such guarantee or security interest is in
the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit and whether the company’s subsistence is
jeopardized by the granting of such security interest. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly
reflected in the Dutch Guarantor’s objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires.

A legal act, including the grant of a guarantee or security right granted by a Dutch company may be suspended or
avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te
_Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary_
receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s
articles of association. If the Dutch Guarantor has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be

235

made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying
trading venue, shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as
provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of
association of, or in an agreement with, as well as the Dutch Guarantor itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise
Chamber for this purpose. The guarantee itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under
it may be suspended or avoided.

To the extent Dutch law applies, any creditor of the Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or receiver) may nullify
any transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor (or its administrator or receiver) in connection with the
notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) any transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection
with the notes was conducted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned
or, in the case of its/their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act
(irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions) and (iii) at the time of any transaction
or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the notes was conducted, the Dutch Guarantor and,
unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that
one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana).

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document
was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake
(dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands,
pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may,
regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness
(redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding
factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening).

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the
claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for
the creation of a parallel debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that
it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the
mechanism of parallel debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged,
noteholders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document.
In addition, the noteholders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as
the beneficiary of the parallel debt.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the
company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand
that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide
sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is
subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot
be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.

The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act
(Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a
Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.

A receiver in bankruptcy may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors,
and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the receiver.
Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one
year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application
being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt entity materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of
existing obligations of the bankrupt entity which are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt entity and its counterparty
when the shares in both are held indirectly by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt entity and its counterparty are part
of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a
bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the
receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte
_rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy_
had been filed, or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty
with a view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any
such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be
successful.

**Poland**

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a general description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Poland relating to bankruptcy
and restructuring proceedings and how such laws affect the enforcement rights of secured and unsecured creditors are
relevant for the Polish Guarantors, being the Polish limited liability companies.

The insolvency laws of Poland are primarily set out in the Bankruptcy Law dated February 28, 2003, as amended
(Prawo upadłościowe) (the “Polish Insolvency Law”). There is also the Polish Restructuring Law of 15 May 2015 (“Polish
**Restructuring Law”) which regulates four types of restructuring proceedings (postępowania restrukturyzacyjne) leading**
to an arrangement with creditors.

By default, the courts of Poland have jurisdiction over insolvency proceedings of a company with its center of
main interests in Poland, presumably – incorporated and registered in Poland.

The insolvency laws of Poland and, in particular, the provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law in relation to priority
of creditors and the duration of insolvency proceedings may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments, to the extent exceeding the limitations
arising under other insolvency laws.

A declaration of bankruptcy should be issued in respect of a debtor that has become insolvent. A debtor is obliged,
and each of the creditors has the right, to file a petition for bankruptcy, if the following bankruptcy tests are met: (i) the
liquidity test (the Polish Guarantors will be deemed insolvent if it loses the ability to settle its due and payable liabilities,
which will be presumed to be the case if the delay in payment exceeds three months, although this presumption will be
rebuttable); or, for corporate debtors, (ii) the balance sheet test (the Polish Guarantors will be deemed insolvent if its
pecuniary obligations exceed the value of its assets (the Polish Insolvency Law does not specify whether this relates to the
market value or the book value)), provided that this situation status continues for longer than 24 months, and future
liabilities (including liabilities subject to a suspensory condition) and shareholder loans will not be taken into account for
this purpose. Nevertheless, the Polish court will be in a position to dismiss a bankruptcy petition even if the balance sheet
test is met, if there is no threat to the Polish Guarantors’ ability to perform its due and payable obligations in the short term.
If the Polish court is satisfied that the relevant substantive bankruptcy test is met, it will issue an order declaring the debtor
bankrupt and nominating a trustee responsible for managing or supervising the Polish Guarantors’ assets during the
bankruptcy proceedings. Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish Guarantors (whether alone or with others)
is obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish Guarantor bankrupt within 30 days from when the grounds for declaration
of bankruptcy above are met. In practice, it is difficult to determine the day from which 30 days’ time limit for filing the
motion should be counted.

If the assets of the debtor are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings or suffice only to cover those costs,
the court will dismiss the bankruptcy petition. The court may also dismiss a petition where it has been established that the
assets are encumbered by security (such as a mortgage or pledge) to such an extent that the residual assets are insufficient
to cover the costs of the proceedings. However, the court will not order dismissal if it is established that the encumbrances
on the debtor's assets are ineffective under the Polish Insolvency Law, or that they were created to the detriment of creditors,
and further, if it is established that the debtor performed other acts, such as disposing of assets sufficient to cover the costs
of the proceedings, which can potentially be set aside under the Polish Insolvency Law and, as an additional condition, if
the circumstances of the case indicate that by applying the relevant provisions on the ineffectiveness and contesting of the
debtor's acts, assets with a value in excess of the predicted costs will be obtained.

Restructuring proceedings in relation to the Polish Guarantors may be initiated by a debtor that is insolvent (on
the basis of the bankruptcy tests specified in the Polish Insolvency Law) or threatened with insolvency (the debtor is deemed
to be threatened with insolvency if its economic situation shows that it may become insolvent in the short term).

In the event of conflicting petitions for bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings, the Polish court will withhold
the bankruptcy petition and the restructuring petition will be considered first (and if the restructuring petition is accepted,
it will not be possible to declare the Polish Guarantors bankrupt as long as restructuring proceedings are pending). In
exceptional cases, if withholding the bankruptcy petition was in conflict with the interest of all the creditors, the bankruptcy
court could decide to consider both petitions at the same time.

Provisions of any agreement which stipulate that such an agreement will be terminated and/or amended upon
bankruptcy (or upon bankruptcy petition being filed) of one of the parties are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to
which the bankrupt entity is a party which hinder or prevent the objectives of the insolvency proceedings will be deemed
ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy estate.

Any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than Polish złoty, regardless of whether the claim has fallen due or
not, if put on the list of claims, must be converted into Polish złoty at the average exchange rate of the National Bank of
Poland (NBP) prevailing on the date on which the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor's bankruptcy and when
there was no such rate - according to the average market price on that date. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy,

237


-----

creditors may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date of the decision of the bankruptcy court on the debtor's
bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any proceeds of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency proceedings will be
carried out through liquidation of the bankrupt debtor's assets.

In insolvency proceedings, all creditors, whether secured or unsecured, wishing to assert claims against the debtor,
need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Polish insolvency proceedings are in principle collective proceedings
and creditors are barred from pursuing their individual claims separately.

Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the relevant insolvency proceeding (lodging of claims)
and will be paid on a pro rata basis out of the bankruptcy estate according to the categories of satisfaction provided by the
Polish Insolvency Law. Creditors who have a security interest over the debtor's assets or any part thereof have priority
rights under the governing law of the security interest and under the relevant provisions of the Polish Insolvency Law. In
essence, secured creditors are not entitled to enforce such security interest outside the relevant insolvency proceeding.

Creditors secured by a registered pledge may enforce their security interest directly by way of appropriation of
such collateral if the pledge agreement provided for such a way of enforcement.

**_Bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings_**

Under Polish law, the following proceedings may be commenced in respect of the insolvent or near-insolvent Polish
Guarantor:

- bankruptcy proceedings (postępowania upadłościowe) leading to liquidation (although an option to conclude an
arrangement with creditors in bankruptcy is also available); and

- four types of restructuring proceedings (postępowania restrukturyzacyjne) leading to an arrangement with creditors:

(a) proceedings for approval of an arrangement (postępowanie o zatwierdzenie układu);

(b) accelerated arrangement proceedings (przyspieszone postępowanie układowe);

(c) ‘standard’ arrangement proceedings (postępowanie układowe);

(d) remedial proceedings (postępowanie sanacyjne).

**_Bankruptcy proceedings (postępowania upadłościowe)_**

The principal aim of bankruptcy proceedings is the satisfaction of the creditors from the proceeds obtained from
the sale of the debtor’s assets (bankruptcy proceedings would result in dissolution of the debtor’s company unless otherwise
permitted by law). However, the aim of bankruptcy is not only to satisfy creditors, but also to preserve the distressed
business if “rational reasons” so permit. Accordingly, it is possible to reach a composition in the course of bankruptcy
proceedings, although the submission of composition proposals will not automatically result in a stay of liquidation. The
provisions of the Restructuring Law apply accordingly to a composition concluded in bankruptcy proceedings and its
effects (to the extent not regulated otherwise in the Polish Insolvency Law).

The Polish Insolvency Law also regulates pre-packs (przygotowana likwidacja). It is possible to file with the
court, together with a bankruptcy petition, a motion for approval of the terms of sale of the whole distressed business or a
substantial part thereof. It must specify the terms of the sale (stating at least the price and the purchaser, although it is also
possible to submit a draft sale agreement to be concluded by the trustee), and be accompanied by a valuation report prepared
by a certified court expert as well as a proof of payment of a security deposit (wadium). The application for approval of the
terms of sale or a draft sale agreement should also specify address or e-mail of the purchaser. It is possible to request that
the debtor’s enterprise be handed over to the buyer on the day bankruptcy is declared, in which case the full price will have
to be paid in advance to the court’s deposit account. The court will approve the motion if the offered price is higher than
the estimated liquidation proceeds that could be raised in “standard” bankruptcy proceedings, less the estimated costs of
the proceedings. If the offered price is lower than (but still close to) the estimated net liquidation proceeds, the court will
still be in a position to approve the sale if this is supported by an “important social interest” or if this allows the distressed
enterprise to be preserved.

Any contractual provisions stipulating a modification or termination of a legal relationship with the debtor in the
event of a bankruptcy declaration or filing of a bankruptcy petition are void by operation of law. This does not mean that
it is impossible to terminate or modify a contract with the debtor after a bankruptcy petition is filed or after it is declared
bankrupt, but it is impossible to do so by reference to the filing or to the declaration of bankruptcy.

The Polish Insolvency Law sets out specific rules applicable to termination of certain contracts and it grants the
trustee the right to „cherry-pick” executory contracts (i.e. those that have not been performed in full or part before the
commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings), but otherwise, if the trustee fails to perform a contract, the other party
should be able to terminate it based on generally applicable provisions of law and subject to the terms of the contract.

238


-----

The bankrupt’s claim may be set off against a creditor’s claim if both claims existed on the date of declaration of
bankruptcy, regardless of whether the claims have not yet become due and payable. A set-off is not admissible if the
bankrupt’s debtor acquired the claim by assignment or endorsement after bankruptcy was declared or acquired it during
the year preceding the date of declaration of bankruptcy, while being aware that there were grounds for declaring
bankruptcy. However, this limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has become the bankrupt’s creditor as a result of
repaying the bankrupt’s debt, for which it was liable personally or with certain property items, and if the acquirer was not
aware of the existence of grounds for declaring bankruptcy at the time of assuming liability for the bankrupt’s debt or (ii)
if the liability was assumed at least one year before the date on which bankruptcy was declared. The set off is also not
admissible if bankrupt’s creditor become bankrupt’s debtor after the date of declaration of bankruptcy. The sum proposed
to be set off on the part of the bankrupt is the total of the bankrupt’s claim and on the part of the creditor it is the creditor’s
principal claim only, along with interests accrued until the date of declaring bankruptcy. If the bankrupt’s debt without
interest had not become due and payable by the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the sum to be set-off is the amount due
reduced by statutory interest (which may not exceed six percent) between the date of declaration of bankruptcy until the
date of payment, and may not exceed two years. A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right must make a statement in
this respect not later than when submitting the claim.

Once bankruptcy is declared, the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be subject to security, charged with a pledge,
registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers may be made to establish
any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such entry had been filed at least six months
prior to filing the motion for bankruptcy.

The Polish Insolvency Law does not require a bankruptcy receiver to give effect to intercreditor arrangements
such as subordination agreements. Although the law does not preclude creditors from attempting to enforce such rights in
separate proceedings based on their entitlements arising from respective contracts, such proceedings are conducted outside
of and following bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, the claims of all unsecured creditors may be paid on a _pari passu_
basis in bankruptcy proceedings.

As a rule, Polish Company’s debts are divided into four categories and creditors whose receivables are ranked in
a lower category cannot be satisfied before all the debts in the higher category have been fully satisfied. The first category
principally includes payments to the state or employees (remuneration, health benefit payments and social security
obligations, etc.) or related to the restructuring proceedings (including arising under a credit facility, loan, bonds, guarantees
or letters of credit, or other form of financing envisaged in the arrangement concluded in the restructuring proceedings and
provided in connection with the arrangement’s performance). Most unsecured commercial debts, tax and other public dues
are listed in the second category. The third category encompasses interest on debts in the first and second categories (in the
order in which the principal is satisfied), court or administrative penalties, donations etc. The fourth category concerns
debts to direct and certain indirect shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect that were granted within
five years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy including interest accrued thereon. Within a category, each creditor’s
receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in that category. Before satisfying any claims, the
bankruptcy receiver covers the costs of bankruptcy proceedings and the liabilities of the bankruptcy estate.

Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision declaring bankruptcy.
Under the Polish Insolvency Law, any debt payable in a currency other than Polish zloty (such as euro), if being put on the
list of claims, must be converted into Polish zloty according to the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate
prevailing on the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the
debt has fallen due or not). Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in the list of claims.
If a claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal. The claims are submitted electronically via a
computerized system servicing the proceedings.

In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, an arrangement between the debtor and creditors can be voted on
and approved by the creditors. In such case after the approval by the court, the provisions of the arrangement determine
the manner of satisfaction of creditors’ receivables. If the repayment of receivables arising under the Note Guarantee is
covered by the arrangement, there is a possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the
creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Insolvency Law).

The Polish Insolvency Law provides that the terms of agreements with the debtor that make it impossible or
difficult to achieve the purposes of bankruptcy proceedings will be ineffective vis-à-vis the bankrupt estate.

**_Restructuring proceedings (postępowania restrukturyzacyjne)_**

A debtor may apply for restructuring proceedings if the debtor is at risk of insolvency and/or is insolvent
(“Restructuring Proceedings”). A creditor may apply for remedial proceeding (one of the types of the Restructuring
Proceedings (please see below)) but only if a debtor is insolvent.

The Restructuring Proceedings may be carried out against a debtor who is insolvent and/or at risk of insolvency.
An insolvent debtor shall be construed as a debtor who is insolvent in the meaning of the Polish Insolvency Law. A debtor

239


-----

threatened with insolvency shall be construed as a debtor whose economic situation indicates that he may soon become
insolvent. The Restructuring Proceedings shall be instituted on the basis of the restructuring application filed by the debtor
(or creditor, if he is allowed to apply for remedial proceeding). The restructuring application shall be construed as an
application for the opening of the restructuring proceedings or an application for the approval of the arrangement adopted
in the arrangement approval proceedings.

In the case of filing a restructuring application and a bankruptcy application, the restructuring application shall be
examined first.

The purpose of the Restructuring Proceedings is to avoid a declaration of bankruptcy of the debtor by enabling
him to restructure through an arrangement with creditors and, in the case of remedial proceedings, by carrying out remedial
actions, while safeguarding the legitimate rights of creditors.

The arrangement approval proceedings shall enable the conclusion of the arrangement, where the debtor shall
collect the creditors' votes by himself without involvement of the court and may be carried out if the total disputed claims
which give the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the
arrangement.

The accelerated arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after a list of claims
under a simplified procedure has been prepared and approved; it may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give
the right to vote on the arrangement does not exceed 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement.

The arrangement proceedings shall enable the debtor to conclude the arrangement after a list of claims has been
prepared and approved and may be carried out if the total disputed claims which give the right to vote on the arrangement
exceeds 15% of the total claims giving the right to vote on the arrangement.

The remedial proceedings shall enable implementation of remedial measures and conclusion of the arrangement
after a list of claims has been prepared and approved.

Cases in the Restructuring Proceedings shall be examined by a restructuring court, which is a district commercial
court.

The restructuring shall be carried out under the following Restructuring Proceedings: (i) arrangement approval
proceedings (postępowanie o zatwierdzenie układu), (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings (przyspieszone
_postępowanie układowe), (iii) arrangement proceedings (postępowanie układowe), (iv) remedial proceedings_
(postępowanie sanacyjne).

_Proceedings for approval of an arrangement (postępowanie o zatwierdzenie układu)_

The arrangement approval proceeding is available to debtors who are able to reach an arrangement with the
required majority of creditors without the court’s involvement. As of 1 December 2021, the arrangement approval
proceeding may be basically conducted in two forms: (i) with the Arrangement Notice (as defined below); or (ii) without
the Arrangement Notice. In the latter case, the debtor will not be protected in relation to creditors (i.e. the creditors will be
entitled to enforce their arrangement or non-arrangement (pozaukładowe) claims).

The debtor will continue to manage its estate, but will be required to appoint a licensed supervisor (nadzorca
_układu), who will: (i) prepare a restructuring plan, (ii) cooperate with the debtor in preparing the arrangement proposals,_
(iii) prepare a list of claims and a list of disputed claims, (iv) assist the debtor in collecting the votes of creditors, and (v)
prepare a report containing a feasibility assessment of the arrangement.

The licensed supervisor may make a notice setting the date of the arrangement (the “Arrangement Notice”) and
no judicial action will be required. In particular, from the Arrangement Notice (i) a four-month moratorium will apply to
enforcement actions; (ii) the debtor’s management of its assets is limited to ordinary management, and any actions
exceeding such scope will require the consent of the licensed supervisor and (iii) it is prohibited to terminate contracts that
are essential to the operation of the debtor’s business. The debtor’s voluntary repayment of debts to be covered by the
arrangement is not prohibited during the four-month period.

The making of the Arrangement Notice is inadmissible if, within the last ten years, the debtor has conducted the
arrangement approval proceedings in which the Arrangement Notice has been made, or within the last ten years,
restructuring proceedings conducted against the debtor have been discontinued, except when the discontinuance of
restructuring proceedings has taken place with the consent of the council of creditors.

The debtor will present a restructuring plan to its creditors and request their votes. Once the approving votes of
the required majority have been obtained, the debtor will file a motion with the court for the approval of the arrangement.
The motion should be filed within three months of the appointment of the arrangement supervisor.

240


-----

If, within four months from the Arrangement Notice, the debtor does not apply to the court for approval of the
arrangement, the effect of the Arrangement Notice shall be extinguished by operation of law.

_Accelerated arrangement proceedings (przyspieszone postępowanie układowe)_

The procedure of the accelerated arrangement proceedings is simplified (in comparison to ‘standard’ arrangement
proceedings), especially in relation to the allowance of claims. Once the proceedings commence, the debtor is not allowed
to perform its obligations, whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary, to be covered by the arrangement. As a rule, this applies
to any pre-petition obligations and post-petition interest, except for employment-related claims and secured claims.
Enforcement proceedings relating to claims to be covered by the arrangement will be stayed by operation of law, and the
judge-commissioner will be in a position to revoke pre-petition attachments of the debtor’s assets. The court will notify
creditors of a creditors’ meeting and the creditors will vote at the meeting (in contrast to arrangement approval
proceedings). The debtor’s estate (‘arrangement estate’) will continue to be managed by the debtor-in-possession, but a
court supervisor (nadzorca sądowy) will be appointed to supervise its management (however, optionally the court may
appoint an administrator (zarządca) to assume full management of the arrangement estate).

_‘Standard’ arrangement proceedings (postępowanie układowe)_

For the interim period between the filing and the opening of arrangement proceedings, the court will be able to
secure the arrangement estate by appointing a temporary court supervisor (tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy). Otherwise, the
scope of protection against creditors available to the debtor, its right to manage the business and other effects of the
initiation of the proceedings will be similar to those applicable to Accelerated Arrangement Proceedings. However, because
of the higher percentage of disputed claims, the allowance of claims is more formalized and time-consuming, and there are
further consequential differences (e.g. relating to the determination of components of the estate and the impact of the
proceedings on pending litigation and administrative proceedings). It is assumed that, depending on the number of pleas
against the list of claims and their complexity, it should take approximately six to ten months to complete arrangement
proceedings.

_Remedial proceedings (postępowanie sanacyjne)_

The broadest restructuring options and the broadest scope of protection against creditors are envisaged in remedial
proceedings. The appointment of an administrator (zarządca) to manage the debtor’s estate (‘remedial estate’) will be
mandatory, unless the debtor’s involvement is necessary for successful restructuring and the debtor guarantees ‘proper
management’ (in which case the court may agree to the debtor’s retaining management over all or part of the business).
Remedial proceedings offer certain remedial options previously available only in liquidation proceedings under the Polish
Insolvency Law and enable thorough economic restructuring of an undertaking. For example, (i) the court can secure the
estate by appointing an interim court supervisor (tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy) or an interim administrator (tymczasowy
_zarządca) for the period between the filing and the opening of remedial proceedings, (ii) powers of attorney and commercial_
procuration (prokura) will expire by operation of law, (iii) it will be possible to adjust the employment level to the needs
of the reorganised undertaking, (iv) the administrator will be entitled to rescind executory contracts (‘cherry-picking right’),
and (v) redundant assets can be sold free of encumbrances (as if they were sold in enforcement proceedings).

**_Preservation of security interests in Restructuring Proceedings_**

As a rule, once Restructuring Proceedings have commenced it will not be possible to create a new security interest
to secure a pre-petition debt (unless the council of creditors agrees otherwise). However, if a motion to register a mortgage
or a registered pledge is filed more than six months before the filing of a motion to open Restructuring Proceedings, the
mortgage or pledge will be registered.

This does not modify the general rule that pre-petition in rem security interests (e.g., mortgage, pledge, registered
pledge, security assignment) survive the Restructuring Proceedings and the claims secured by any of these security
interests, as a rule, are not affected by the arrangement. However, the arrangement will cover secured claims to the extent
that these claims are not covered by the value of collateral, or the relevant secured creditor agrees to be covered by the
arrangement. Secured creditors consenting to the arrangement may be allocated to a separate class of creditors and be
afforded special treatment in the arrangement (i.e., different from unsecured creditors).

There is an important exception to this rule in relation to partial arrangements (which are permitted in arrangement
approval proceedings and accelerated arrangement proceedings), if the proposed arrangement offers the relevant secured
creditor full satisfaction (although on a date specified in the arrangement) or satisfaction in part, but to the extent not lower
than that expected in the case of enforcement of security. If this exception applies, the relevant secured claim will be
covered by the arrangement irrespective of the creditor's consent.

241


-----

Certain security interests will be infective towards the remedial estate (masa sanacyjna), namely:

(i) security established by the debtor within one year before the date of filing the application for the opening

of remedial proceedings which has not been established directly in connection with the receipt of the
performance by the debtor shall be ineffective in relation to the remedial estate;

(ii) security in the part which on the day of the establishment of the security exceeds more than half the value

of the secured performance received by the debtor together with claims for incidental performance
determined in the document forming the grounds to provide security, established within the year prior to
the date of the filing of the application for the opening of remedial proceedings, shall be ineffective in
relation to the remedial estate.

The above rules also apply to guarantees, suretyships (Polish: poręczenia) and to other similar activities performed
to secure performances.

In addition, there are certain legal transactions, other than security interests, which are ineffective towards the
remedial estate – namely, transactions by means of which the debtor has disposed of its assets, if they were concluded by
the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was
submitted and the value of the debtor's performance (Polish: _świadczenie) significantly exceeds the value of the_
performance received by or reserved for the debtor.

**_Priority of Creditors in Insolvency Proceedings_**

The funds of the bankruptcy estate will include proceeds of the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate, and income
earned from running or leasing the bankrupt's enterprise, as well as interest on bank deposits.

Sums obtained from the transfer of assets and rights encumbered with a mortgage or pledge will be allocated to
satisfy those creditors whose receivable debts were secured over the transferred assets or rights (upon a statutory deduction
for the costs of the proceedings).

The Polish Insolvency Law governs the priority of claims for (i) secured creditors (i.e., creditors whose claims are
secured by a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or treasury pledge) and (ii) other creditors. In the latter case, the Polish
Insolvency Law provides for four categories of debts, which include a number of preferential debts (such as money owed
to employees) and several less-preferential ones (ex. money owed to the shareholder and related to the shareholder's loan
or arising from a similar legal action, which are repaid in the last 4th category).

In cases where creditors have rights in rem to the sold tangible property or rights, the receiver makes a separate
plan to distribute the money earned on the sold tangible property or rights.

If the sum allocated for distribution is not sufficient to satisfy all the debts in full, debts of lower categories of
priority are satisfied only after the full satisfaction of debts of preceding categories of priority, and when the assets are
insufficient to satisfy in full all debts within the same category of priority, then such debts shall be satisfied on a pro rata
basis.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

After a debtor is declared bankrupt, the following are recognized as ineffective against the bankruptcy estate, by
operation of law:

(i) a disposition of the debtor's assets if it was effected in the one year preceding the filing of a petition for

the commencement of an insolvency proceeding, if the transaction was gratuitous or for consideration
manifestly lower than the consideration received by the debtor;

(ii) satisfaction of a debt before its maturity date or the granting of security in respect of such debt, if effected

within the period of six months preceding the filing of a petition for the commencement of an insolvency
proceeding, however, the one who received the payment or security may, by means of an action or
complaint, demand that these acts be recognized as effective, if at the time of their performance he did
not know of the existence of grounds for bankruptcy;

Furthermore, a transaction made within the period of six months preceding the filing of a petition for the
commencement of an insolvency proceeding where the debtor is a legal person and the other party is its shareholder,
representative (or spouse of such person) or affiliated company, or such affiliated company's shareholder, representative
(or spouse of such person) (and noting that the same rule applies if the debtor entered into a transaction with a dominant
company) is also ineffective against the bankruptcy estate. Ineffectiveness is recognized by the judge in charge of the
bankruptcy proceedings and shall be determined, ex officio or at the request of the receiver.

-----

Security interests granted over a party's assets in the form of registered pledges or other security interests may be
voidable transactions which are capable of being challenged by an administrator of the bankruptcy estate and may be set
aside by a judge-commissioner within two years of a declaration of bankruptcy, if: the party was not personally liable for
the debt and such security interest was granted less than one year preceding the date of the bankruptcy petition; if the party
did not receive any consideration for the granting of such security interest or the consideration received was
disproportionately low in comparison to the value of the security interest granted; or regardless of the value of consideration
previously received by the party, security interests were granted to secure debts of companies in the same corporate group,
unless the other party proves that there was no harm to creditors.

Other actions detrimental to creditors may also be challenged on the basis of the Actio -Pauliana, governed by
articles 527 onward of the Polish Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny).

In addition, a transfer of future receivable is ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if such receivable arises
after the declaration of bankruptcy, unless the agreement on the transfer of receivable was concluded in writing with a
certified date (Polish: forma pisemna z datą pewną) at least six months before the day on which the bankruptcy petition
was submitted.

The transfer of the ownership title to a thing, claim or other right to the creditor (Polish: _przewłaszczenie na_
_zabezpieczenie) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate if such agreement has been made in writing with a certified date._

**_Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests_**

Comments made below are relevant for the Polish Guarantors, being the Polish limited liability companies or
security interests granted under Polish law.

_Actio Pauliana_

Polish civil law provides a basis for declaring some actions done to the detriment of creditors ineffective (so called
“actio Pauliana”). In general, if as a result of a legal act performed by a debtor to the detriment of creditors, a third party
gains a financial benefit, each of the creditors may demand that the said act be declared ineffective with respect to it, if the
debtor acted knowingly to the creditors' detriment, and the third party knew or, having used due care, could have learned
of it. This provision applies accordingly if the debtor acts with an intention to harm future creditors. It is assumed that the
debtor's legal act is performed to the creditors' detriment if, as a result of such act, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes
insolvent to a greater degree than he was before performing the act (as described in the Supreme Court judgements Case
No. II CSK 548/11). The application to the court with respect to “actio Pauliana” can be filed within five years from the
date of the act.

Furthermore, the Polish Civil Code stipulates that if a contract is executed whose performance renders the
satisfaction of a third-party claim partly or wholly impossible, that party may demand that the contract be declared
ineffective with respect to it if the parties to the contract knew of the claim or if the contract was free of charge.

_Limitations resulting from the Polish Insolvency Law_

The aggregate liability and exposure of any Polish Guarantors under the Note Guarantees might be also limited
to the extent required so that such obligations do not and cannot result in insolvency as defined by Article 11 section 2 of
the Polish Insolvency Law. However, the above limitation will not apply if one or more of the following circumstances
occurs:

(i) any event of default is continuing irrespective of whether such event of default occurs before or after the

relevant Polish Guarantor becomes insolvent within the meaning of Article 11 section 2 of the Polish
Insolvency Law; or

(ii) the liabilities of any Polish Guarantor (other than those under the finance documents) result in its

insolvency within the meaning of Article 11 section 2 of the Polish Insolvency Law; or

(iii) Polish law is amended in such a manner that balance sheet insolvency (Polish: niewypłacalność) as

provided for in Art. 11 section 2 of the Polish Insolvency Law no longer gives grounds for bankruptcy
or no longer obliges the Polish Guarantor to file for bankruptcy.

Granting of the Note Guarantees by the Polish Guarantor is also subject to certain provisions of the Polish
Commercial Companies Code (Polish: Kodeks Spółek Handlowych) of September 15, 2000, as amended (the “Polish
**Commercial Companies Code”). With respect to the limited liability company (Polish:** _spółka z ograniczoną_
_odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.) pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the creation of a limited right in rem_
over the enterprise or over its organized part requires a resolution of the shareholders under the pain of invalidity.

Pursuant to Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the shareholders may not receive, under
any title, any payments from the Polish limited liability company's assets needed to fully cover the share capital of this

243


-----

company. A breach of this rule results in the shareholders' obligation to return the payments up to the amount of the share
capital. Therefore, the liability of any Guarantor incorporated under Polish law on account of payments under the Note
Guarantees should be limited by the Polish capital maintenance rules i.e., so that it would not result in a payment being
made in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code.

If a share pledge is enforced and the shareholder changes, a new “relation of domination” might arise. In such
case the new shareholder would be obliged to notify the dependent company, _i.e., the Polish Guarantor, of this fact._
Otherwise, its right to vote from its shares representing more than 33% of the share capital of the dependent company will
be suspended. A new relation of domination might also arise if under a pledge agreement, the pledgee gains a majority of
the votes at the general meeting of the Polish Guarantor. The corresponding notification duty has to be fulfilled by the
pledgee.

_Interests limitation_

Pursuant to Article 359 of the Act of April 23, 1964 Civil Code, as amended (the “Civil Code”), the maximum
interest resulting from the legal act, i.e., so called “capital interest” (Polish: odsetki kapitałowe) cannot per annum exceed
double statutory interest (i.e., double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and
(ii) 3.5 percentage points).

In addition, according to the Article 481 of the Civil Code, the maximum interest resulting from a delay (Polish:
_odsetki za opóźnienie) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest for delay (i.e., double of the sum of: (i) the_
reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 5.5 percentage points).

Should the value of interest exceed the value of relevant maximum interest, then relevant maximum interest is
due. Contractual provisions cannot exclude or limit the provisions on maximum interest. The above-mentioned specific
provision of Polish law shall be applied by a Polish court irrespective of the fact that the parties have chosen foreign law
to govern the transaction (overriding mandatory provisions).

_Perfection requirements_

Generally, under Polish law, for a valid and effective establishment of security interests certain perfection
requirements need to be fulfilled, including the requirements specified below.

The registered civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the shares in the Polish Guarantor may be validly
established only after fulfillment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper registered
pledge agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the
competent court and will become effective vis à vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such
pledge; (ii) the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be executed with the signatures certified by a Polish notary
and will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such pledge; (iii) the
proper financial pledge agreement must be executed and will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is
notified of the establishment of such pledge, (iv) the pledges should be disclosed in the book of shares of the Polish
Guarantor. Additional formal requirements are to be complied with.

The registered civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the bank accounts the Polish Guarantor may be validly
established only after fulfilment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper registered
pledge agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the
competent court; (ii) the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be executed with a certified date (i.e., a date certified
by a Polish notary); (iii) the proper financial pledge agreement must be executed; (iv) the bank maintaining the bank account
needs to be notified by the pledgor about the establishment of the civil (ordinary) and financial pledge; and (v) a financial
pledge over the funds in a bank account should be noted in the relevant bank account that is the subject of the security. The
agreement of the security assignment or transfer of ownership of a thing, receivable or of other right (even if governed by
non-Polish law) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate (as defined by the Polish Insolvency Law) of the assignor, if it
was executed in writing with a certified date (i.e., a date certified by a Polish notary).

In principle, a secured creditor can enforce its security once the secured claim becomes mature, in whole or in
part (that is, the debt becomes due and payable). Under certain circumstances, the creditor must obtain a final and nonappealable court decision and enforcement clause before enforcing its security. A less formal procedure is possible, for
example, if the claim is secured by registered or financial pledge and the pledge agreement provides that the creditor can
take over the pledge object.

_Parallel debt structure under Polish law_

In majority of cases, under Polish law security interests cannot be granted to a party other than the creditor of the
secured claim. Generally, under Polish law, the pledge or mortgage is strictly accessory and follows the debt or claim it
secures and may not be transferred without such debt or claim. If such debt or claim is transferred without the pledge or
mortgage, the pledge or mortgage will expire.

244


-----

For that reason, in certain transactions, also in Poland, a parallel debt structure is used, whereby the guarantor, as
a separate and independent obligation governed by non-Polish law, undertakes to pay to the security agent amounts equal
to the amounts due by it to all creditors in a given transaction. Such parallel debt structure, therefore, creates a single
separate and independent claim of the security agent that can be validly secured by a security interest. Consequently, the
security interests are granted to the security agent in its own capacity as a creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the
parallel debt, and not as a representative of the creditors. It is usually expressly agreed in such parallel debt agreement that
the obligations of the debtor towards the security agent shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal
obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa).

The Supreme Court issued the judgments on October 9, 2009 (Case No. IV CSK 145/09, Case No. IV CSK 169/09
and Case No. IV CSK 155/09) concerning the effectiveness of establishing security interests over the assets of the debtor
of parallel debt. In the above cases, the Supreme Court has not challenged the validity of a foreign law parallel debt
structure, however, such structure was only indirectly referred to in the above judgments. As there is no doctrine of
“precedence” under Polish law, uncertainty exists as to validity and enforceability of the parallel debt under Polish law.

As Polish law does not recognize the concept of “trust” or “trustee,” it is uncertain how the Security Agent will
be treated by a Polish court.

**United States**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States, have their registered offices in the
United States or currently have, or may in the future have, property located in the United States. Insolvency proceedings
may, therefore, be initiated in respect of one or more of such Guarantors in the United States. U.S. law would then govern
those proceedings. A voluntary bankruptcy case may be commenced by the Guarantor, or an involuntary bankruptcy case
could be commenced by certain unsecured creditors of the Guarantor, in each case as provided under title 11 of the United
States Code (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”).In addition, the Issuer and direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer that do
not currently have the requisite connections to the United States may also still be eligible to be debtors in cases under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code where, among other things, they later acquire property located in the United States.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance
laws, which vary from state to state or jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes, the
issuance of the guarantees, and the grant of security, whether now or in the future, by the Issuer and the Guarantors (together,
the “Obligors”) could be avoided or set aside as an actual or constructively fraudulent transfer/incurrence of a debt if,
among other things, a court determined that at the time the Obligors incurred the obligations, issued the related guarantee,
or granted the security, the Obligors (i) incurred the obligations, issued the related guarantee, or granted the security with
the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or (ii)(a) received less than reasonably equivalent
value or fair consideration in return for incurring the obligations, issuing the related guarantees, or granting the security
and (b) either:

      - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence or grant of security;

      - were engaged, or were about to be engaged, in a business or transaction for which the Obligors' remaining
assets constituted unreasonably small capital or assets to carry on the business engaged or anticipated; or

      - intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,
property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A U.S. court would likely find that an Obligor did
not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes offered hereby or the guarantees thereof if such
Obligor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable
guarantee. Given that the guarantees furnished by the U.S. Guarantors are upstream guarantees, there is a risk that a U.S.
court may determine that one or more of such Guarantors did not receive reasonably equivalent value in return for entering
into the guarantees.

The Group cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not an Obligor was
solvent at the relevant time. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending
on the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, an entity would be considered
insolvent by a U.S. court if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

      - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair value of
all its assets;

245


-----

      - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

      - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations
and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. In an _in limine ruling in the In re W.R._
_Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S._ Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the
transferor and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s
analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time
of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If the principle articulated
by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and
would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to be a fraudulent transfer.

If the Notes offered hereby or guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any
claim you may make against any Obligor for amounts payable on the Notes or the guarantees would be unenforceable to
the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made
by any Obligor.

Although any guarantee entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes offered hereby will contain a
provision intended to limit that guarantor's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the
incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect such
guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor's obligation to an amount that
effectively makes its guarantee worthless. Any future pledges of collateral by an Obligor in favor of the holders of the
Notes to secure the debt incurred thereby might similarly be subject to later challenge and potential avoidance as fraudulent
transfers. In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a bankruptcy, claims in respect of liens or obligations
evidenced by the Notes or guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Federal Insolvency Proceedings_**

Certain Obligors may have operations that would be subject either to proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or any applicable state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a debtor
with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy, subject to the rights of creditors and other parties
in interest to object and seek relief from the bankruptcy court. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory
framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to:

      - the administration of a bankruptcy case, including (i) the imposition of the automatic stay, which
immediately stays all litigation, as well as most enforcement and other actions against the debtors or
property of the bankruptcy estate; (ii) provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors to protect
against diminution of value of their collateral; (iii) terms for the use, sale or lease of property; (iv)
standards for obtaining post-petition credit; and (v) rules regarding the treatment of executory contracts
and unexpired leases;

      - creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority and
allowance of claims, rights of secured creditors, and subordination of claims, including pursuant to
principles of “equitable subordination”; and

      - the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and ability to bring
turnover and avoidance actions, provisions relating to liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and the filing of ancillary and other
cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor's
assets by a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court and typically results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor's
business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue to operate their business as
a going concern while they reorganize their businesses and resolve their obligations to creditors (although a liquidation or
sale under chapter 11 is also possible), in each case pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation, as applicable. Unlike
in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor typically remains in possession of its assets and
continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case (subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy
court), with substantially the same rights that a trustee would otherwise have. In addition, "liquidating" chapter 11 cases
may be used as an alternative to a liquidation under chapter 7, particularly where the conversion of a pending chapter 11

246


-----

case to a case under chapter 7 might prove prohibitively expensive or in an instance when the debtor seeks to sell all or
substantially all of its assets free and clear of liens during the course of the bankruptcy case.

Because bankruptcy proceedings are often fact specific and vary case-by-case, and because bankruptcy courts are
courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
that could affect the Notes and/or the guarantees and security is not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law
applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover
the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction. To the extent more information is required, potential
investors in the Notes should consult an insolvency professional familiar with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the applicable
state insolvency laws.

**_Preference_**

Any future grant of security interest with regard to the Collateral in favor of the Notes, including pursuant to
security documents delivered after the date of the Senior Secured Indenture, or any payment made by an Obligor to the
holders of the Notes on account of its obligations under the Notes or guarantees, might be avoidable in a U.S. bankruptcy
case by the grantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preferential transfer if certain events or
circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is insolvent at the time of the grant or payment, the
security interest or payment permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than they would otherwise receive
in a hypothetical case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and a bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor is
commenced within 90 days following the grant or payment, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.

**_The Automatic Stay_**

The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce its security interests against the Obligors upon the occurrence of an
event of default under the Indenture is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S. bankruptcy law if one or more
of the Obligors became a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before such security interest were enforced.
Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as a holder of Notes is
prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from taking any act to obtain possession of or
exercise control over, property of the bankruptcy estate, including any act to create, perfect, or enforce a lien against
property of the estate. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the Obligors could therefore prevent the
holders of the Notes from obtaining possession of, or exercising control over, the Collateral, commencing any action in an
attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the Collateral, or perfecting any liens that were not properly perfected
prior to the bankruptcy. The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain
circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court
may deny such a request.

**_Right of Debtor-In-Possession to Remain in Control of Collateral and the Bankruptcy Process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its
property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession,” subject to certain limitations.
This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the
debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection”
of its interest in the debtor's property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it
may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each
case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among
other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay.

The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S.
bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution in
the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a
plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within the first 180 days of the
case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months
after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During
these “exclusive periods,” other parties such as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or soliciting
acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans.

In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusive
periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

      - whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests;

247


-----

      - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed
or confirmed; or

      - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss
of value of the collateral through the requirement of "adequate protection."

**_A Debtor-In-Possession May Obtain New Credit Secured by a Lien That is Senior or Equal to Existing Liens_**

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an extension
of new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and
circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien
that is senior or equal to existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or
more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior
or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing.

**_Ability to Confirm a Chapter 11 Plan Notwithstanding the Dissenting Votes of Creditors_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or equity holder (or class of
creditors or equity holders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of
all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity
interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan
may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the
plan, and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled
to vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it.

A class of claims that is entitled to vote is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims
holders and two-thirds in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy
court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more
impaired classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with
the "cram-down" provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so long as the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair
and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This
could allow the debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes.

248

**TAXATION**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other
than the repayment of principal under the Notes) it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding taxes
imposed at the jurisdiction from which payment is made at varying applicable withholding tax rates, subject to such relief
as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may
apply.

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences in relation to the Notes (in particular
regarding taxes on the income from the Notes withheld at source). It does not purport to be a comprehensive description
of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes, and, in particular, does not
consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax
laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes, including the effect of any state, local or church taxes, under the tax
laws of Germany and any country in which they are resident or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

**_German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer)_**

With regard to savings income (Kapitalerträge) (e.g., interest or capital gains) German withholding tax
(Kapitalertragsteuer) will be levied if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account which the investor
maintains with a German securities institution, a German branch of a German or non-German credit or financial services
institution (auszahlende Stelle, “German Disbursing Agent”) and such German Disbursing Agent credits or pays out the
earnings. If the Notes are not kept or administered in a custodial account, German withholding tax will nevertheless be
levied if the Notes are issued as definitive securities and the savings income is paid by a German Disbursing Agent against
presentation of the Notes or interest coupons (a so-called over-the-counter transaction – Tafelgeschäft).

The tax base is, in principle, equal to the taxable gross income (i.e., prior to withholding). However, in the case
of capital gains, if the custodial account has changed since the time of the acquisition of the Notes by the holder (e.g., if
the Notes had been transferred from a non-EU custodial account prior to the sale) and the costs of the Notes are not proven
to the German Disbursing Agent in the form required by law (e.g., in the case of over-the-counter transactions), withholding
tax is applied to 30% of the proceeds from the redemption or sale of the Notes, unless the current Disbursing Agent has
been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement
of a credit, financial services or securities institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or in certain
other countries/territories, (e.g., the Swiss Confederation or the Principality of Andorra). When computing the tax base for
withholding tax purposes, the German Disbursing Agent has to deduct any negative savings income (negative
_Kapitalerträge) realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other_
securities with the exception of shares) or paid accrued interest (Stückzinsen) in the same calendar year or unused negative
savings income of previous calendar years.

Capital losses from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes held as private assets should
generally be tax-recognized irrespective of the holding period of the Notes. The losses may, however, not be used to offset
other income like employment or business income but may only be offset against investment income subject to certain
limitations. Losses not utilized in one year may be carried forward into subsequent years but may not be carried back into
preceding years. Losses arising from a full or partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Notes including
a default of the Issuer, bad debt (Forderungsausfall) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any
other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of EUR 20,000
per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of EUR 20,000 can be carried forward and might be set off in future tax
periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of EUR 20,000 per year
(“Limitation on Loss Deduction”). Given the Limitation on Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing
Agent holding the Notes in custody, investors suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are
required to declare such losses in their income tax return. Although the relevant amount has been increased from EUR
10,000 to EUR 20,000, the constitutionality of the Limitation on Loss Deduction is still being debated. Therefore, investors
affected by the Limitation on Loss Deduction are advised to seek individual tax advice. The German withholding tax will
be levied by a German Disbursing Agent at a flat withholding tax rate of 25 (plus solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag)
at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus, if applicable, church tax). Church tax, if applicable,
will be collected by the German Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has filed a blocking notice
(Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern). In the latter case, the investor
has to include the savings income in the tax return and will then be assessed to church tax. Further, church tax is not

249


-----

collected by way of withholding if the investment income forms part of income from trade business, self-employment,
agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing.

No German withholding tax will be levied if the investor has filed a withholding tax exemption certificate
(Freistellungsauftrag) with the German Disbursing Agent, but only to the extent the savings income does not exceed the
exemption amount shown on the withholding tax exemption certificate. Currently, the maximum exemption amount is
EUR 1,000 (EUR 2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners). Similarly, no withholding tax
will be levied if the investor has submitted a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by
the relevant local tax office to the German Disbursing Agent.

Payments made to a holder resident in a so-called “non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives
_Steuerhoheitsgebiet) should be subject to a tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a rate of 15% (plus solidarity_
surcharge) of the gross payment pursuant to the Defence against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung
_und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze,_ “StAbwG”). However, pursuant to recently
introduced legislation no withholding tax will be levied if bearer notes which are represented by a global note
(Sammelurkunde) are held in collective safe custody with a central depositary or similar instrument are tradable on a
recognized stock exchange. The exact scope of this exemption is, however, unclear.

The Issuer is not obliged to levy German withholding tax in respect of payments on the Notes.

**_Tax assessment_**

The taxation of savings income shall take place mainly by way of levying withholding tax (please see above). If
and to the extent German withholding tax has been levied, such withholding tax shall, in principle, become definitive and
replace the investor's income taxation. If no withholding tax has been levied other than by virtue of a withholding tax
exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) and in certain other cases, the investor is nevertheless obliged to file a tax
return, and the savings income will then be taxed within the assessment procedure (Veranlagungsverfahren). If the investor
is subject to church tax and has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office
(Bundeszentralamt für Steuern), the investor is also obliged to include the savings income in the tax return for church tax
purposes.

However, also in the assessment procedure, savings income is principally taxed at a separate tax rate for savings
income (gesonderter Steuertarif für Einkünfte aus Kapitalvermögen) being identical to the withholding tax rate (26.375%

- including solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) plus, if applicable, church tax). In certain cases, the investor may
apply to be assessed on the basis of its personal tax rate if such rate is lower than the above-mentioned tax rate. Such
application can only be filed consistently for all savings income within the assessment period. In case of jointly assessed
spouses or registered life partners the application can only be filed for savings income of both spouses/life partners.

When computing the savings income, the saver's lump sum amount (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of EUR 1,000
(EUR 2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners) will be deducted. The deduction of the actual
income related expenses, if any, is excluded. That holds true even if the investor applies to be assessed on the basis of its
personal tax rate.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate
income tax liability. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return
and the balance will be taxed at the holder's applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance
payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or
corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and
gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax
(Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder
is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited
against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in Germany are
generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent
establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income
constitutes German source income in the form of income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German
situs real estate, unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Globalurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German
Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibung), (iii) the income
otherwise constitutes German-source income (such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs property
or income from a hybrid instrument issued by a German tax resident issuer) or (iv) the income is attributable to an investor
resident in a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsbegiet) which is mentioned on the EU list
of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions and adopted in the German Defence against Tax Havens Act (including the German

250


-----

Tax Haven Defence Ordinance). Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to
German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over-the-counter transaction (Tafelgeschäft) by a
German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain
requirements, a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by
an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**Certain European Taxation Considerations**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to introduce a
financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial intermediary). The
timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own
professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following information is of a general nature and is included herein solely for preliminary information
purposes. It is a summary of certain material Luxembourg tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the
Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all possible tax situations that may be relevant to a decision to
purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. It is included herein solely for preliminary information purposes. It is not intended
to be, nor should it construed to be, legal or tax advice. This summary does not allow any conclusion to be drawn with
respect to issues not specifically addressed. The following description of Luxembourg tax law is based on the Luxembourg
law and regulations as in effect and as interpreted by the Luxembourg tax authorities on the date of the Offering
Memorandum. These laws and interpretations are subject to change that may occur after such date, even with retroactive
or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax consequences of
subscribing, purchasing, holding and disposing the Notes, including the application and effect of any federal, state or local
taxes under the tax laws of Luxembourg and each country of which they are tax residents or citizens.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy impost or other charge or
withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to
Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax
(impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax
(impôt sur le revenu). A corporate taxpayer may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune), as well as other
duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to
most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal
income tax and a solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the
management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Tax Residency_**

Holders of Notes will not become resident nor be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only of the
holding of the Notes or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of their rights thereunder.

**_Withholding Tax_**

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_

Subject to the Luxembourg law of 23 December 2005, as amended (the “Relibi **Law”), there is under Luxembourg**
tax laws currently in effect no Luxembourg withholding tax under the Notes on payments of interest (including accrued
but unpaid interest) made to resident holders of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon repayment of
principal or premium in case of reimbursement, settlement, repurchase or exchange of the Notes.

Under the Relibi Law and the Relibi circular published by the Luxembourg tax authorities on 22 February 2023,
payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg, on a debt security
that is publicly issued on a regulated market, to (a) an individual beneficial owner who is resident in Luxembourg for tax
purposes, or (b) a vehicle (with or without legal personality) held by one or more individuals beneficial owners resident in
Luxembourg for tax purposes if this vehicle is interposed between the paying agent and the individual(s) beneficial
owner(s) specifically in order to avoid the withholding tax, are subject to a withholding tax of currently 20%. Such
withholding tax is in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the
management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of the tax is assumed by the Luxembourg paying
agent. If interest payments under the Notes fall within the scope of the Relibi Law, such payments will be subject to a
withholding tax at a rate of currently 20%.

251


-----

Pursuant to the Relibi Law, Luxembourg resident individuals acting in the course of the management of their
private wealth can opt to self-declare and pay a 20% tax on interest payments made on or after December 31, 2007, by
paying agents located in an EU Member State or a Member State of the European Economic Area other than Luxembourg.
The 20% tax self-declared will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the
course of the management of his/her private wealth.

Moreover, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident
corporate holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax
payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident corporate holders of Notes under the Relibi
Law.

_Non-Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes. Under the Luxembourg tax law currently in effect, there is no_
withholding tax on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) made to a Luxembourg non-resident holder
of Notes. There is also no Luxembourg withholding tax upon repayment of the principal, sale, refund or redemption of the
Notes.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes—Income Tax_**

_Resident Holders of Notes_

Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes or non-Luxembourg tax resident Holders of Notes who have a
permanent establishment, a fixed place of business or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Notes are
attributable, must, for income tax purposes, include any interest paid or accrued in their taxable income. Specific
exemptions may be available for certain taxpayers benefiting from a particular status.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Individuals._

An individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his or her private wealth, is subject to
Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the Notes, except
if (i) withholding tax has been levied by a Luxembourg paying agent on such payments in accordance with the Relibi Law,
or (ii) the individual holder of the Notes has opted for the application of a 20% tax in full discharge of income tax in
accordance with the Relibi Law.

Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realized upon the sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes by an
individual holder of Notes, who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and who acts in the course of the management
of his or her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more than
six months after the acquisition of the Notes and the Notes do not constitute zero coupon notes. However, any portion of
such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax, except if tax has been
levied on such interest in accordance with the Relibi Law.

An individual holder of Notes, who acts in the course of the management of his or her private wealth and who is
a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes, must further include the portion of the gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid
interest income in respect of the Notes in his or her taxable income, insofar as the accrued but unpaid interest is indicated
separately in the agreement, except if a final withholding tax or levy has been levied in accordance with the Law.

Luxembourg tax resident individual holders of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or
business undertaking to which the Notes are attributable, must include any interest received or accrued, as well as any gain
realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in any form whatsoever, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax
assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price
(including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold, repurchased or redeemed.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Companies._

Luxembourg corporate holders of Notes must include any interest received or accrued, as well as any gain realized
on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. Taxable
gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including but unpaid interest) and the
lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Companies Benefiting from a Special Tax Regime. Luxembourg holders of Notes who_
benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for example, (i) undertakings for collective investment subject to the amended
law of 17 December 2010, (ii) specialized investment funds governed by the amended law of 13 February 2007, (iii) family
wealth management companies governed by the amended law of 11 May 2007, or (iv) reserved alternative investment
funds treated as specialized investment funds for Luxembourg tax purposes governed by the amended law of 23 July 2016
are exempt from income taxes in Luxembourg and thus income derived from the Notes, as well as gains realized thereon,
are not subject to income taxes.

252


-----

_Non-Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_

Holders of Notes who are non-Luxembourg tax residents and who have neither a permanent establishment nor a
permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes are attributable are not liable to pay any Luxembourg
income tax, irrespective of whether they receive payments of principal or interest (including accrued but unpaid interest)
or realize capital gains upon redemption, repurchase, sale, disposal or exchange, in any form whatsoever, of any Notes.

Holders of Notes who are non-Luxembourg tax residents and who have a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes are attributable are liable to pay Luxembourg income tax on
any interest received or accrued, as well as any reimbursement premium received at maturity and any capital gain realized
on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes and must include this income in their taxable income for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes—Net Wealth Tax_**

Luxembourg tax resident holders of Notes and non-Luxembourg tax resident holders of Notes who have a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes are attributable, are
subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder of Notes is (i) an individual, (ii) an undertaking
for collective investment subject to the amended law of 17 December 2010, (iii), a securitization company governed by the
amended law of 22 March 2004, (iv) a company governed by the amended law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles,
(v) a specialized investment fund governed by the amended law of 13 February 2007, (vi) a family wealth management
company governed by the amended law of 11 May 2007, (vii) a professional pension institution governed by the amended
law of 13 July 2005, or (viii) a reserved alternative investment fund governed by the amended law of 23 July 2016.

However, (i) a securitization company governed by the amended law of 22 March 2004 on securitization, (ii) a
company governed by the amended law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles (iii) a professional pension institution
governed by the amended law dated 13 July 2005 and (iv) an opaque reserved alternative investment fund treated as a
venture capital vehicle governed by the amended law of 23 July 2016 remain subject to minimum net wealth tax.

The Luxembourg Constitutional Court, in a decision of November 10, 2023, ruled that the fixed minimum net
wealth tax of EUR 4,815 is unconstitutional. In its ruling, the Luxembourg Constitutional Court stated that pending a
legislative amendment, the progressive minimum net wealth tax should be applied whenever it is more favorable to the
taxpayer than the EUR 4,815 fixed minimum net wealth tax. On May 23, 2024, a bill of law (n. 8388) was introduced in
Luxembourg to amend several tax points, one of which is the minimum net wealth tax. According to this bill, the minimum
net wealth tax will be capped at EUR 4,815. The minimum net wealth tax is set to range between EUR 535 and EUR 4,815.
Such bill has not been voted yet at the time of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes—Other Taxes_**

Under Luxembourg tax laws, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, is no Luxembourg registration tax,
stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg by the holders of Notes as a consequence of the issuance
of the Notes, nor will any of these taxes be payable as a consequence of a subsequent transfer, redemption or repurchase
of the Notes (except in case of voluntary registration in Luxembourg or if the Notes are appended to a deed which is
mandatorily subject to registration or are lodged with the notary for his records (déposé au rang des minutes d’un notaire)).

In case of registration, such registration will be made with the Administration de l'Enregistrement, des Domaines
et de la TVA. The Administration de l'Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA (i) will apply and collect a fixed or ad
valorem registration tax depending on the nature of the obligations, deeds (actes) and transfers (mutations) referred to in
the above mentioned documents and (ii) may also require that all or part of the registered documents be translated into
French or German.

Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax
purposes at the time of his or her death, the Notes are included in his or her taxable base for inheritance tax purposes. On
the contrary, no estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the Notes upon death of a holder of Notes in cases
where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes at the time of his or her death.
Luxembourg gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of the Notes if the gift is recorded in a deed executed before a
Luxembourg notary or otherwise registered in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issuance of the
Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or the transfer of the Notes.

**_Exchange of Information_**

_FATCA_

Capitalized terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the FATCA Law (as defined below),
unless otherwise provided herein.

The Issuer is subject to the so-called FATCA legislation which generally requires reporting to the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service of non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with FATCA and direct or indirect ownership by
U.S. persons of non-U.S. entities. As part of the process of implementing FATCA, the U.S. government has negotiated
intergovernmental agreements with certain foreign jurisdictions which are intended to streamline reporting and compliance
requirements for entities established in such foreign jurisdictions and subject to FATCA.

Luxembourg has entered into a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement implemented by the Luxembourg law of
24 July 2015, as amended or supplemented from time to time (the “FATCA Law”), which requires Financial Institutions
located in Luxembourg to report, when required, information on Financial Accounts held by Specified U.S. Persons (as
defined under the FATCA Law), if any, to the Luxembourg tax authorities (administration des contributions directes).

Under the terms of the FATCA Law, the Issuer is treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial Institution.

This status imposes on the Issuer the obligation to regularly obtain and verify information on all of the holders of
Notes. On the request of the Issuer, each holder of Notes shall agree to provide certain information, including, in the case
of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (“NFFE”), information on the Controlling Persons of such NFFE, along with
the required supporting documentation. Similarly, each holder of Notes shall agree to actively provide to the Issuer within
30 days any information that would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address or a new residency address.

The FATCA Law may require the Issuer to disclose the names, addresses and taxpayer identification number (if
available) of the holders of Notes as well as information such as account balances, income and gross proceeds (nonexhaustive list) to the Luxembourg tax authorities for the purposes set out in the FATCA Law. Such information will be
relayed by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if applicable, of the
processing of their information by the Issuer.

Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has a right to
access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if necessary). Any data obtained
by the Issuer is to be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation.

Although the Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid imposition of FATCA
withholding tax, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to satisfy these obligations. If the Issuer becomes
subject to a withholding tax or penalties as result of the FATCA regime, the value of the Notes held by the holders of Notes
may suffer material losses. The failure for the Issuer to obtain such information from each holder of Notes and to transmit
it to the Luxembourg tax authorities may trigger the 30 per cent. withholding tax to be imposed on payments of U.S. source
income as well as penalties.

Any holder of Notes that fails to comply with the Issuer’s documentation requests may be charged with any taxes
and/or penalties imposed on the Issuer as a result of such holder’s failure to provide the information and the Issuer may, in
its sole discretion, redeem the Notes of such holder of Notes.

Holders of Notes who invest through intermediaries are reminded to check if and how their intermediaries will
comply with this U.S. withholding tax and reporting regime.

Holders of Notes should consult a U.S. tax advisor or otherwise seek professional advice regarding the above
requirements.

_Common Reporting Standard_

Capitalized terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the CRS Law (as defined below),
unless otherwise provided herein.

The Issuer is subject to the Common Reporting Standard as set out in the Luxembourg law of 18 December 2015,
as amended or supplemented from time to time (the “CRS Law”) implementing Directive 2014/107/EU which provides
for an automatic exchange of financial account information between Member States of the EU as well as the OECD’s
multilateral competent authority agreement on automatic exchange of financial account information signed on 29 October
2014 in Berlin, with effect as of 1 January 2016.

254


-----

Under the terms of the CRS Law, the Issuer is treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial Institution.

As such, the Issuer will be required to annually report to the Luxembourg tax authorities personal and financial
information related, inter alia, to the identification of, holdings by and payments made to (i) certain holders of Notes
qualifying as Reportable Persons (as defined in the CRS Law) and (ii) Controlling Persons of passive non-financial entities
(“NFEs”) which are themselves Reportable Persons. This information, as exhaustively set out in Annex I of the CRS Law
(the “Information”), will include personal data related to the Reportable Persons.

The Issuer’s ability to satisfy its reporting obligations under the CRS Law will depend on each holder of Notes
providing the Issuer with the Information, along with the required supporting documentary evidence. In this context, the
holders of Notes are hereby informed that, as data controller, the Issuer will process the Information for the purposes as set
out in the CRS Law.

Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if applicable, of the
processing of their Information by the Issuer.

Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has a right to
access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if necessary). Any data obtained
by the Issuer are to be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation.

The holders of Notes are further informed that the Information related to Reportable Persons will be disclosed to
the Luxembourg tax authorities annually for the purposes set out in the CRS Law. The Luxembourg tax authorities will,
under their own responsibility, eventually exchange the reported information to the competent authority of the Reportable
Jurisdiction(s). In particular, Reportable Persons are informed that certain operations performed by them will be reported
to them through the issuance of statements, and that part of this information will serve as a basis for the annual disclosure
to the Luxembourg tax authorities.

Similarly, the holders of Notes undertake to inform the Issuer within 30 days of receipt of these statements should
any included personal data not be accurate. The holders of Notes further undertake to immediately inform the Issuer of,
and provide the Issuer with all supporting documentary evidence of any changes related to the Information after occurrence
of such changes.

Although the Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid any fines or penalties imposed
by the CRS Law, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to satisfy these obligations. If the Issuer becomes
subject to a fine or penalty as a result of the CRS Law, the value of the Notes held by the holders of Notes may suffer
material losses.

Any holder of Notes that fails to comply with the Issuer’s Information or documentation requests may be held
liable for penalties imposed on the Issuer as a result of such holder’s failure to provide the Information or subject to
disclosure of the Information by the Issuer to the Luxembourg tax authorities and the Issuer may, in its sole discretion,
redeem the Notes of such holder of Notes.

**Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain US federal income tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This discussion is
limited to consequences relevant to a US holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined
under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any US federal tax laws other than
US federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-US tax laws. This discussion is
based upon the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the
“Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and
all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the US Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that
the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder
in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax,
or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, US expatriates, insurance companies, individual
retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, US holders whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, S corporations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, US
holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding
the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the

255


-----

anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect
to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons
who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount
of the Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting
in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). This discussion does not address tax consequences to
holders whose senior secured fixed rate notes due 2025 are being refinanced in substantially simultaneous transactions.

For purposes of this discussion, a “US holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for US federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a
corporation for US federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless
of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust,
or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a US person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the US
tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their
tax advisors regarding the US federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the US federal income tax**
**considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

Based on certain terms of the Notes (see e.g., “Description _of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” and “Description_
_of the Notes—Optional Redemption—Change of Control”), it is possible that the IRS could assert that the Notes are properly_
treated as contingent payment debt instruments for US federal income tax purposes. The Issuer does not intend to treat the
Notes as contingent payment debt instruments, and the discussion below assumes that the Notes will not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments for US federal income tax purposes. The Issuer's determination is binding on a US
Holder unless such US Holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable US Treasury
Regulations. The Issuer's determination is not binding on the IRS, however, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge
the determination, adverse US federal income tax consequences could apply to US Holder and in the event contingent
payments were to occur, characterization of the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments would also affect the amount,
character, and timing of the income recognized by a US Holder. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes
will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. US Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
potential treatment of the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments for US federal income tax purposes.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid with respect to withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a US holder as ordinary
income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such US holder’s method of accounting
for US federal income tax purposes.

A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of
the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of
whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method US holder will not recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss
attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is
required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value
of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S.
dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at
the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years,
at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis US holder may elect,
however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the
interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the
last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of
receipt of the accrued interest, a US holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such

256


-----

interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above-mentioned election will apply to other
debt instruments held by an electing US holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A US holder that
uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect
to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal
the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange
on the date such interest is received) with respect to such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income
that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated,
for foreign tax credit purposes, as US source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for US federal income tax purposes. Notes will be
treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an
amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal
amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event the Notes are issued with OID, US holders of Notes generally will be required to include such OID
in gross income (as ordinary income) for US federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual
method regardless of their regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, US holders
generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The amount of any OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a US holder is the sum of the “daily
portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such US holder
holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the
OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term
of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest
occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period
is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to
maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length
of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at
the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual
period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal
and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars
in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated
_Interest.”_

A US holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the
disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to
the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the spot rate
of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the
manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest
payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made
for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex
and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well
as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign
tax credit purposes, as US source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (and OID, if any) on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally
will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to US holders under US federal
income tax laws. Any non-US withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a US holder at the rate applicable to such holder
may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for US federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). If a refund of any tax withheld is available under any
applicable income tax treaty, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a US
holder’s US federal income tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against US federal taxable income).
Certain US Treasury regulations that apply to foreign income taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after
December 28, 2021 restrict the availability of any such credit based on the nature of the tax imposed by the foreign

257


-----

jurisdiction, although the IRS has provided temporary relief from the application of certain aspects of these regulations
until new guidance or regulations are issued. There are significant complex limitations on a US holder’s ability to claim
foreign tax credits. US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any
withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any amount
equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income as discussed above to the
extent not previously included in income by the US holder) and such US holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A US holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such US holder, increased
by any OID previously accrued by such US holder with respect to the Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign
currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date
of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant US holder is
either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such US holder
will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on
the settlement date of the purchase.

If a US holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency
translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis US holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis US holder, will determine the U.S.
dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the
disposition. The special election available to accrual basis US holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes
traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the US holder and
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis US holder that does not make the special election will
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the
disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute US source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally
will be US source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or
loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase
price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the US holder
disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated
at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss
attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and OID, if any, which will be treated
as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, upon
a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder will recognize any foreign
currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest and accrued OID, if any) only to the extent
of total gain or loss realized by such US holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be US source gain or loss
and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate US holders (including individuals) derived with
respect to capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to limitations.

US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign currency
received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest (and the accrual of OID,
if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note
paid to a US holder unless such US holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the US holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number
or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable requirements
of the backup withholding rules. US holders may be required to provide such certification on IRS Form W-9.

258


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against a US holder’s US federal income tax liability provided the required information
is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses
in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received with respect to a foreign
currency note. US holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with
respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

US holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess
of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information report (IRS
Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a US holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such
holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all US
federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date
on which such report is filed. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting
requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity
may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

US holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”) and subject to
the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold US tax on certain
“foreign passthru payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain US source payments.
Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such
date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes
only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for US federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on the Notes that are
not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of
publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally
may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. No such final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments have been issued as of the date hereof. Non-US governments including Germany have entered into agreements
with the United States (and additional non-US governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement
FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules
may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any
payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Payment by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject
to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable
double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor
will be eligible for exemption from withholding tax.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS
THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED
TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN
THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes by
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of
the Code, and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such employee benefit plans,
plans, accounts or arrangements (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of
ERISA and regulations promulgated under ERISA by the US Department of Labor) (each, an “ERISA Plan”). Employee
benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-US plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (together with ERISA Plans,
“Plans”) are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; however, such plans may be subject
to non-US, federal, state, or local laws or regulations that are substantially similar to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code (“Similar Laws”) or which otherwise affect their ability to invest in the Notes.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit certain
transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the
Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or
the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA
Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should consult
with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in
accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or
any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any
exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in
order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable
Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, and the Trustee and their
respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is undertaking to act, or will undertake to act, as a fiduciary
to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking
to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary
capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials
from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any
specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any
specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan
purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified
persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to
the transaction. Such “prohibited transactions” include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a
party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in
interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified
person, of any plan assets.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan
that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party
is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance
with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from
the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan, depending
on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party
in interest or disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA
and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers
to the ERISA Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions

260


-----

(“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from
time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified
professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38
(respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting life insurance company general accounts) and
PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers).

Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of an ERISA
Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully
review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can
be no, and the Issuer does not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect
to any particular transaction involving the notes.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of
ERISA) and non-US plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may
nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing
the Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Laws.
Because of the foregoing, the Notes (or any interest therein) should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan
assets” (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3 101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA)) of any Plan, unless
such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be
construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative
rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such changes
may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited
transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the
Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel and advisors regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption
would be applicable.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be
deemed to have represented and agreed that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire
and hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) (a) the acquisition, holding and disposition
by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes (or any interest therein) does not and will not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any
Similar Laws, and (b) none of the Transaction Parties is undertaking to act, or will undertake to act, as a fiduciary to any
Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold a Note or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or
give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to any decision to purchase, hold or transfer a Note.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).
Notes sold to persons other than “US persons” (as defined in Regulation S under the US Securities Act) outside the United
States in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the “144A Global Notes”, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common
depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests in
the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interest” and, together with the 144A Book-Entry
Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or
persons that may hold interests through such participants and will be required to be effected in accordance with applicable
transfer restrictions set out in the Notes, the Indenture and in any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States
or of any other jurisdiction, as described under “Notice to Investors,” “Notice to EEA Investors,” “Notice to Certain Other
_Investors” and under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected_
only through, records maintained in book-entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry
Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on
their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by
such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair
the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of
interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the
Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holder” of Notes under the Indenture for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominee), will be
considered the holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders
under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar under the Indenture nor any of the
Issuer’s respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names,
will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or
holders thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered Notes in
certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

      - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository
and a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

      - if the owner of a Book-Entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect
thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in
any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their
respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership

262


-----

of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to
_Investors,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law._

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable,
will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests
in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis
(with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however,
that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) to the Paying Agent. In turn, the Paying Agent will make
such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and
Registrar will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or
its nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none
of the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

      - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or
payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records
of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account
of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

      - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

      - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of
such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance
with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions. Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons
wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the US Securities Act or
any other exemption (if available under the US Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional
buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the US Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A under the US Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction._

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the relevant Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note
for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be
changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between
their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others
such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities
that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest,
may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain
persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to
such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. The
Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

264


-----

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a
matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the relevant settlement systems
and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Calculation Agent, or the Paying
Agent takes any responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the systems or their
participants directly to discuss these matters.

**_Initial Settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day
following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made
on the desired value date.

**_Special Timing Considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. Certain investors who wish to transfer their
interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the
transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Brussels if Euroclear is used, or Luxembourg if
Clearstream is used.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act, or any state
securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act and other applicable state securities laws.
Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold only (i) to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A
under the US Securities Act) (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) to persons other than “US persons” outside the
United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S:

The Issuer uses the terms “offshore transaction,” “US person” and “United States” with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes hereunder (other than the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the
US Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not
requiring registration under the US Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and,
unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the US Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in
any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set out in paragraphs (4)
and (5) below;

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144), nor acting on its behalf and that either:

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of these Notes to it will
be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another
QIB; or

(b) it is not a US person and it is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S;

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries or the offer or
sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum
has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It
acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation
or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. It acknowledges that the Issuer, and not the
Initial Purchasers, have ultimate authority over the statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, including the
content of those statements and whether or not to make them. It has had access to such financial and other information
concerning the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Notes that it deems necessary in connection with its decision to purchase
any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers;

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting
as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the US Securities Act or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that
the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control
and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the US Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the US Securities Act;

(5) It understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, that if
in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Notes or any beneficial interests in any Notes, it will not
do so prior to the date which is, in the case of 144A Global Notes, one year after the later of the original issue date of such
Notes, the original issue date of the issuance of any additional notes and the last date on which the issuer or any affiliate
of the issuer was the owner of such Note (or any predecessor of such Note) or, in the case of the Regulation S Global
Notes, 40 days after the later of the original issue date and the last date on which the Securities were first offered to persons
other than Distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) only (i) to
the Issuer, the Guarantor or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared
effective under the US Securities Act, (iii) for so long as such Note is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a
person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is
given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the
United States to non US persons in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S or (v) pursuant to any other

266


-----

available exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases
to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject
to the Issuer’s right prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an
opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to it, including a certificate of transfer in the form
appearing on the reverse of such Note.

(6) It understands that the Global Notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE US
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “US SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR
PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED,
ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR
UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, SUCH REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE US SECURITIES ACT.

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, (1) REPRESENTS THAT
(A) IT IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE US
SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”)) OR (B) IT IS NOT A US PERSON AND IS ACQUIRING THIS NOTE
IN AN “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION” PURSUANT TO RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE US
SECURITIES ACT, AND (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR
ACCOUNT FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED SECURITIES, TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE DATE THAT IS IN THE CASE OF RULE 144A NOTES:
ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF, THE ORIGINAL ISSUE
DATE OF THE ISSUANCE OF ANY ADDITIONAL NOTES AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE
ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY
PREDECESSOR OF SUCH SECURITY), IN THE CASE OF REGULATION S NOTES: 40 DAYS AFTER
THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF AND THE DATE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY
(OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF SUCH SECURITY) WAS FIRST OFFERED TO PERSONS OTHER THAN
DISTRIBUTORS (AS DEFINED IN RULE 902 OF REGULATION S) IN RELIANCE ON REGULATION S,
ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, THE PARENT GUARANTOR OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B)
PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER
THE US SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE
PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE US SECURITIES ACT, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY
BELIEVES IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A THAT
PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE
144A, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES TO NON-US PERSONS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE US SECURITIES ACT, OR (E)
PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
OF THE US SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO ANY
REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF SUCH
INVESTOR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL AND TO
COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL
LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRANSFER
AGENT’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER (I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSES
(D) OR (E) TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR
OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM (II) IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING
CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE FORM APPEARING ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THIS SECURITY IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE
TRANSFER AGENT AND (III) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS
SECURITY IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND. IN
THE CASE OF REGULATION S NOTES: BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER HEREOF
REPRESENTS THAT IT IS NOT A US PERSON NOR IS IT PURCHASING FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A US
PERSON AND IS ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE
WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE US SECURITIES ACT.

BY ITS ACQUISITION OF THIS SECURITY, THE HOLDER THEREOF WILL BE DEEMED TO
HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED THAT EITHER (A) IT IS NOT AND FOR SO LONG AS IT
HOLDS THIS SECURITY (OR ANY INTEREST HEREIN) WILL NOT BE (I) AN “EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLAN” AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF THE US EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT
OF 1974, AS AMENDED (“ERISA”) THAT IS SUBJECT TO TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) A “PLAN” AS
DEFINED IN AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 4975 OF THE US INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS

267


-----

AMENDED (THE “CODE”), (III) AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE THE ASSETS
OF ANY SUCH EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN SUBJECT TO ERISA OR OTHER PLAN SUBJECT TO
SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE (THE FOREGOING COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “ERISA
PLANS”), OR (IV) A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-US PLAN WHICH IS SUBJECT TO ANY
STATE, LOCAL, OTHER FEDERAL LAW OF THE UNITED STATES OR NON-US LAW THAT IS
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF
THE CODE, OR (B) ITS ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND DISPOSITION OF THIS SECURITY WILL NOT
RESULT IN A NONEXEMPT PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR
SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR, IN THE CASE OF SUCH A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NONUS PLAN, A VIOLATION OF ANY SUCH SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR STATE, LOCAL, OTHER
FEDERAL LAW OF THE UNITED STATES OR NON-US REGULATION, RULE OR LAW.

ANY PURPORTED TRANSFER OF THE NOTES (OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN) IN VIOLATION
OF THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THESE PARAGRAPHS SHALL BE NULL AND VOID _AB_
_INITIO, AND THE ISSUER WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMPEL ANY TRANSFEREE ACQUIRING THE_
NOTES (OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN) IN VIOLATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN
THESE PARAGRAPHS TO SELL SUCH NOTES (OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN) OR TO SELL SUCH
NOTES (OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN) ON BEHALF OF SUCH TRANSFEREE.

A purchaser of Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to Holders of
beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to Holders of these Notes.

(7) It understands that the issuance of Additional Notes under the Indenture may have the effect of extending
the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

(8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on the
transfer of such Notes;

(9) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the
Securities within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the US Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A;

(10) It acknowledges that the Book-Entry Registrar and Transfer Agent will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer, Transfer
Agent and the Book-Entry Registrar that the restrictions set out therein have been complied with;

(11) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by your purchase of the Notes
are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary
or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such
investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on
behalf of each such investor account; and

(12) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer,
the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where
action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set
out under “Plan of Distribution,” “Notice to EEA Investors” and “Notice to Certain Other Investors.”

(13) If resident in a Member State of the EEA, it is not a “retail investor.” For the purposes of this paragraph,
the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (1) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

(14) It acknowledges that the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” (as defined in paragraph 13 above) in the
EEA.

268


-----

Any Investor purchasing the Securities is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer, sale, delivery or
resale of the Securities by such investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

269


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, subject to certain
customary closing conditions, to subscribe to and pay for, the Notes on the Issue Date.

The sale will be made pursuant to an agreement among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers (the
“Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to
the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, to purchase from the Issuer all of the Notes. The Purchase
Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to,
among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by the Issuer’s and their counsel. The Purchase Agreement
also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make
in respect thereof. The Issuer has furthermore agreed to reimburse the Initial Purchasers for certain expenses incurred in
connection with the issue of the Notes. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have made certain
representations and given certain warranties with respect to their respective legal and financial matters. The Initial
Purchasers are entitled, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Purchase Agreement. In such event, no Notes will be
delivered to investors.

The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that it or its affiliates and subsidiaries will not, directly
or indirectly, sell or offer to sell any securities substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 90 days from the date the
Notes are issued without first obtaining the written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made to The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is no assurance that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange or that such listing will be maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer
may at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the Holders, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange for the
purposes of moving the listing of the Notes to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers. The Initial
Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of the Offering. However, the
Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without
notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the US Securities Act and the
US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “US Exchange Act”). Accordingly, it cannot be assured that any
market for the Notes will develop, or that such market will be liquid if it does develop, or that an investor will be able to
sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable.

Persons that purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and, therefore, may not make sales of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable
U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States,
they will do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act or qualified
for sale under the securities laws of any US state or any jurisdiction outside the United States and may not be offered or
sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore transactions
in reliance on Regulation S. Accordingly, the Notes will be subject to significant restrictions on resale and transfer as
described under “Notice to Investors,” “Notice to EEA Investors,” “Notice to Certain Other Investors” and “Transfer
_Restrictions.” Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker dealers who_
are registered as such under the US Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this offering
and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United
States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the
US Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the US Securities Act.
Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in
connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does
not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors); and

270


-----

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, or sold and will not offer or sell any
Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance
**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of**
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. The expression “offer”
includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes
to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

Further, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, or sold and will not offer or sell
any Notes to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of
domestic law in the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”);
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law in the United Kingdom by
virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation
as it forms part of domestic law in the United Kingdom by virtue of the EUWA.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Luxembourg, Germany and the United
Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable
rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell
or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into
whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions
relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors,”
“Notice to EEA Investors,” “Notice to Certain Other Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract
or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the US Securities Act or the safe harbors of
Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefore on or around the date specified
on the cover page of the Offering Memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1(c) under the US Exchange
Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle on the next succeeding business day, unless the parties
to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or
the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the
next succeeding business days should consult their own advisor.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. The Initial Purchasers have
advised the Issuer that, following the completion of this offering, they currently intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so, and the Initial
Purchasers may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the Notes at any time in its sole discretion.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid and that you will
be able to sell any of the Notes held by you at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be
favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an
_active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.” Each purchaser of the_
Notes, by its purchase of the Notes, will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations, warranties
and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors,” “Notice to EEA Investors” and “Notice to Certain Other Investors.”

In connection with the offering, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (the “Stabilizing Manager”) (or persons
acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over allotment,
stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the
Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering

271


-----

transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the
Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. These activities may stabilize,
maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices
that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the
Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither the Issuer
nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that
these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must
end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which
may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time
to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial
banking services (including, among others, hedging, financing, guarantee business, cash management and various other
banking services and activities) to the Issuer and its affiliates, or to the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of
business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for the Transactions. In
particular, the Initial Purchasers or certain of their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Super Senior
Facilities, and such entities have received or will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Furthermore,
certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing RCF Facility Agreement and the
Existing L/G Facility Agreement and have received or will receive customary fees for their services. Following the
completion of the Offering, the Existing RCF Facility Agreement and the Existing L/G Facility Agreement will be
cancelled in full and any outstanding utilizations thereunder will be repaid. The Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates are, or will become, lenders under the super Senior Facilities Agreement and have received or will receive
customary fees for their services.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their
respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the Issuer consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure
by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes.
The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views with respect to such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients
that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized
under the laws of Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. None of the members of board or other
executives of the Issuer and the Non-US Guarantors are residents or citizens of the United States. Therefore, you may be
unable to effect service of process within the United States on such directors, officers or executives. Furthermore, since the
assets of the Issuer and each of the Non-US Guarantors, and their respective directors and officers are located outside the
United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Non-US Guarantor or any such other
person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any
judgment of a US court predicated upon civil liabilities under US Federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in
the United States.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. A substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer is
located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the
United States upon the Issuer or to enforce against it judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of U.S. federal or state securities laws. In Luxembourg, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process upon
the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantors incorporated and existing under Luxembourg law within Luxembourg in
accordance with the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965.

The United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. An enforceable judgment
for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon the US securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such
favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting
enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New
Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S.
judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

      - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

      - the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter both
under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and under applicable Luxembourg international
private law conflict of jurisdiction rules and local law;

      - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, or at
least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal
doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a
Luxembourg court);

      - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws
of Luxembourg or has not been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature (which would
include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or
other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or
punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages
would not be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such
punitive damages may be considered as a penalty;

      - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

      - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the U.S. judgment
was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it
appeared, to present a defense; and

      - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although
there is no statutory prohibition to do so.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if
the choice of such law was not made bona fide and (ii) if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy or is

273


-----

manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of
U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought.
Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation
expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed
as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg
would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

**Germany**

The Issuer has been advised by its German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on US federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment
obtained in US federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any US federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated
solely upon US federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by
a US federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung).
In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a US court,
except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgements if any of the reasons
for excluding enforceability set forth in Sections 723(2), 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung) exist:

    - the judgment is final under US federal or state law;

    - if, pursuant to German law, the courts in the country of the court having rendered the foreign judgement did
not have jurisdiction;

    - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided
that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

    - if the judgement is incompatible with a prior judgement rendered by a German court or by a foreign court
which is to be recognized in Germany;

    - if the proceeding resulting in the judgement to be recognized is incompatible with a previously pending
(rechtshängig) proceeding in Germany;

    - if a recognition of the judgement would be obviously incompatible with fundamental principles of German
law (order public), in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights under the
German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the courts of the country where the
judgement was issued would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgement by a German court in
equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from US federal or state courts in Germany. The Issuer cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce
judgments in Germany will be successful.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts
as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a US court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual
losses or damages. Consequently, judgements awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the US
federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of
a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from US civil procedure in a number of aspects, including the
possibilities for obtaining evidence. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, US federal and state law and
the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to
the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of
witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery
process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor the final US federal or state judgement is rendered brings a new lawsuit in the same
matter in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German courts the final judgement rendered in the

274


-----

United States. Under such circumstances, a judgement by a US federal or state court will be regarded by the German court
only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgement relates. A German court may choose to re-hear
the dispute and may render a judgement that is not in line with the judgement rendered by the US federal or state court, but
the latitude to deviate from the foreign judgment is limited. The German court is free to issue a completely new decision if
there are grounds for non-recognition under 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, but must otherwise take the
foreign decision into account (i.e., the foreign judgement has a certain binding effect).

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or
moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally.

**Poland**

The recognition and enforcement of judgments of foreign courts in Poland is subject to limitations (i) specified in
the relevant EU laws (including in particular Council Regulation (EC) Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters if the judgment was issued in a Member State of the European Union); (ii) under international
agreements, if a relevant bilateral/multilateral treaty provides for such enforcement (including in particular the Hague
Convention of June 30, 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements); or (iii) on the basis of the rules of the Polish Code of Civil
Procedure if (i) and (ii) above do not apply. There is currently no treaty between the United States and Poland providing
for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil and
commercial matters. Therefore, in such a case, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure apply. Under that procedure,
any final and conclusive judgment against the Issuer or Guarantor with its registered office in Poland obtained in a court
of the United States and arising out of or in relation to the obligations of the Issuer or Guarantors with its registered office
in Poland, would be recognized ex lege in Poland, unless:

      - the judgment is not final and binding in the US;

      - the judgment was issued on an issue which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Polish courts (such as
matters relating to real property located in Poland);

      - the defendant who has not entered the dispute as to the essence of the disputed issue has not been served
the complaint in the manner enabling the defendant to defend himself;

      - a party was deprived of the ability to defend itself in the course of the proceeding;

      - proceedings related to the same claim between the same parties had been commenced in Poland before
it was initiated in the US court;

      - the judgment is contrary to a previously issued final and binding judgment of a Polish court or of a
foreign court judgment fulfilling the prerequisites for its recognition in Poland and was issued in
proceedings related to the same claim between the same parties; or

      - the recognition of the judgment would be contrary to the fundamental principles of legal order of Poland
(the public policy clause).

Enforceability of any final and conclusive judgment against the Issuer or a given Guarantor with its registered
office in Poland obtained in a court of the United States and arising out of or in relation to the obligations of the Issuer or
Guarantors, further requires that a Polish court issues a decision confirming that given judgment of the US court is
enforceable in Poland (which will be issued provided that given judgment is enforceable in the US and all the conditions
referred to above are met).

Once the motion to declare enforceability is considered and approved, the court issues a decision to grant an
enforceability clause (klauzula wykonalności). Enforcement pursuant to such a decision may be initiated as soon as the
decision granting the enforceability clause becomes final and binding.

Finally, it should be noted that the enforcement actions conducted by the court executive officer (bailiff) may be
challenged and, therefore, the enforcement of obligations sometimes may not be successful or may be lengthy, even if the
US judgment is recognized and enforceable in Poland.

With effective date December 21, 2022, the Group agreed with the lenders to reset the financial covenants, to which the

Actual 2023 met sufficient headroom. Based on the good start to the year in Q1 2024, management of the Group expects

the financial performance for the full year to exceed budget. With current market conditions and business performance,

the Group does not see any current risk to complying with future covenant requirements and consequently the

management does not see any risk to the going concern of the Group. Based on actual Q1 2024 performance and current

forward planning the Group anticipate they will currently be in the position to meet future financial obligations.

**Refinancing process**

The Group is in the process of refinancing all long-term financing instruments: Revolving Credit Facility, Senior Guarantee

Facility, and bonds – which it started in May 2024. Completion of the refinancing is planned for Q3 2024. The management

of the Group currently expects that the Group will be able to meet its covenants.

Therefore, the Condensed consolidated financial statements of Group, for Q1 2024, have been prepared on a going-concern

basis.

#### 2.2 Basis of preparation

Pursuant to clause 4.03(a)(2) of the Indenture, dated October 09, 2019, between the Company and GLAS Trustees Limited
(as Trustee), Global Loan Agency Services Limited (as Paying Agent), GLAS SAS (as Registrar and Transfer Agent) and GLAS
Trust Corporation Limited (as Security Agent) (the “Mangrove Notes Indenture”), the Company is required to set up
Condensed consolidated Financial Statements.

#### 2.3 Group accounting principles and methods

This Condensed consolidated financial report ending 31 March 2024 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (“Interim
Financial Reporting”), which governs interim financial reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, which are endorsed by the European Union, and
the Interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) in effect at the reporting date. As these are Condensed
consolidated financial statements, they do not include all the information required by IFRS for full consolidated financial
statements at the end of a financial year.

The comparable Condensed consolidated Statement of Financial Position refers to the consolidated Statement of Financial
Position as of December 31, 2023. The comparable Condensed consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss Statement as well
as the comparable Condensed consolidated Cash Flow Statement, refer to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Reference should be made as appropriate to the Notes to the consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2023,
particularly with regard to the main recognition and measurement principles, except where financial reporting standards
have been applied for the first time in 2024 or accounting principles have changed.

Sales-related and cyclical items are accrued throughout the year, insofar as they are significant.

The interim Financial Statements are prepared in euros (EUR). All amounts, including the comparative figures, are presented
in thousands of euros (EUR thousand). Due to rounding, figures presented may result in differences of EUR 1 thousand in
certain cases.


-----

#### 2.4 Presentation of the condensed consolidated Financial Statements

For information on presentation principles, estimates, assumptions, and significant judgements that have the greatest
impact on the amounts recognised in these condensed consolidated statements for the period January 1 to March 31, 2024,
please refer to corresponding explanations in consolidated Financial Statements of Mangrove Group as of December 31,
2023.

#### 2.5 Accounting regulations applied for the first time in the year 2024

The following standards and amendments to existing standards of possible relevance to the Group, which were adopted

into EU law (endorsement mechanism) which are effective since January 1 2024, have not been applied early, but are

applied by the Group since start of the fiscal year 2024.

   - **Amendments to IAS 1 (Effective January 1, 2024)**

Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current: The amendments to IAS 1 only affect the presentation of

liabilities in the statement of financial position. They clarify that a liability is classified as non-current if the entity

has a substantive right at the reporting date to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after

the reporting date. The mere existence of a substantial right is sufficient; the company does not have to intend to

exercise this right. This change did not result in a significant effect on the Condensed consolidated financial

statements.

Non-current Liabilities with Covenants: The supplementary amendment to IAS 1 clarifies that if the right to defer

payment is linked to the fulfilment of conditions that must be met within twelve months of the balance sheet

date, these conditions have no influence on the classification as current or non-current. Extended disclosures on

liabilities classified as non-current with covenants are required for risk assessment. This change did also not result

in a significant change on the Condensed consolidated financial statements.

   - **Amendments to IFRS 16 (Effective January 1, 2024)**

Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback: The objective of the Amendments is to specify how a seller-lessee

subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from

Contracts with Customers to be accounted for as a sale. The lease liability must be measured in such a way that

no gain or loss arises on subsequent measurement in relation to the retained right-of-use asset. There are no

material effects on the Condensed consolidated financial statements.

   - **Amendments to IAS7 and IFRS7 (Effective January 1, 2024)**

Supplier Finance Arrangements: The amendments introduce two new disclosure objectives – one in IAS 7 and

another in IFRS 7 – for a company to provide information about its supplier finance arrangements that would

enable users (investors) to assess the effects of these arrangements on the company’s liabilities and cash flows,

and the company’s exposure to liquidity risk. There are no material effects on the Condensed consolidated

financial statements.

#### 2.6 International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules

The Mangrove Group has adopted "International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules” (Amendments to IAS 12) upon their

release on 23 May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the

top-up tax, which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure, which are addressed

in section "Income Taxes - Global minimum top-up tax".


-----

The mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to implement the top-up tax was

enacted or substantively enacted at the 31 March 2024, in any jurisdiction in which the Mangrove Group operates and no

related deferred tax was recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the Mangrove Group 's

Condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Mangrove Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax - which is required to pay under Pillar Two

legislation - is an income tax in the scope of IAS 12. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax

accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.

#### 2.7 Interim financial reporting principles

These interim Financial Statements present a true and fair view of the Group's results of operations, financial position, and
net assets in the reporting period.

The preparation of interim Financial Statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that
may affect the Group's assets, liabilities, provisions, and deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as its income and
expenses. Although management makes such estimates and assumptions carefully and in good faith, actual amounts may
differ from the estimates used in these interim Financial Statements.

Factors that may cause amounts to fall below expectations include deterioration in the global economic situation,
movements in exchange rates and interest rates, as well as material litigation and changes in environmental or other
legislations and errors in internal operating processes. The loss of key customers and rising borrowing costs may also
adversely affect the Group’s future performance.

## 3. Basis of consolidation

As of March 31, 2024, the Mangrove Group comprises 4 companies domiciled in Luxembourg and 50 foreign companies
(totalling 54 as at year-end).

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control is assumed, when the following three criteria are fulfilled: (1)
the parent company holds decision-making power over the relevant activities of the investee, (2) the company has rights
to variable returns from the investee and (3) the parent company can use its decision-making power to affect the variable
returns. The fulfilment of these criteria is assessed based on corporate governance and potential supplementary
agreements.

Companies that are dormant or do not have significant impact on the financial position and results of operation of the
Group are not included in the Condensed consolidated financial statements.

A total of two companies are not consolidated. The aggregate assets, equity, revenues, and earnings of these companies
are not material to the Condensed consolidated financial statements. The subsidiaries are recognised at cost as non-current
other financial assets. Management deems the influence to the Group as absolutely insignificant and hence, the disclosure
required under IFRS has not been made due to materiality reason. The disclosure of this information is not suitable to
communicate additional information.

## 4. Financial Covenants

The Group has entered into the following financing agreements in the course of financing the acquisition of Galapagos
BidCo Group:

   - € 65,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (“RCF”, “RCF Facility Agreement”)


-----

   - € 260,000,000 Senior Guarantee Facility Agreement (“SGF”, “SGF Facility Agreement”)

   - € 234,921,656.23 Cash Collateral Loan Agreement (“Cash Cover Loan Agreement”)

   - € 84,640,713.21 Multilateral Guarantee Facility Agreement (“MGFA”)

   - €356,233,492 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes

The RCF Facility Agreement, the SGF (together, the “Facilities”), the Cash Cover Loan Agreement and the MGFA were
entered into by the Company as parent and certain of its subsidiaries (as borrowers and guarantors). On May 27, 2020, the
process of refinancing the Group’s guarantee and “Letter of Credit” portfolio was completed, and the associated cash cover
loan was fully repaid.

With effective date December 21, 2022, the Group agreed with the lenders to reset the financial covenants set forth in the
facility agreements and make certain additional amendments including, but not limited to, a reduction of the total
commitments under and as defined in the SGF from EUR 260 million to EUR 190 million.

The amended Facilities provide for the following financial covenants:

a) **Minimum EBITDA[1]** – (consolidated EBITDA (normalized Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and
amortization) as defined in the RCF Facility Agreement) - the Group shall be required to meet a minimum amount
of EBITDA in respect of each relevant period. The minimum EBITDA covenant amount is €72,600,000 (the
Minimum EBITDA Amount, as amended) as of March 31, 2024.

b) **Total net leverage – the Group shall be required not to exceed a certain leverage ratio in respect of each relevant**
period (such ratio based on consolidated total net debt (i.e., the aggregate amount of cash and cash
equivalents minus financial indebtedness of the Group as defined in the RCF Facility Agreement) to
consolidated EBITDA). The total required net leverage ratio covenant (as amended) is 5.30 as of March 31, 2024.

c) **Minimum liquidity – the Group shall be required to provide reporting on its liquidity (i.e., freely available cash**
and cash equivalents as defined by the RCF Facility Agreement). If liquidity is less than €25,000,000 (but equal
to, or greater than €20,000,000), a “Soft Minimum Liquidity Breach” shall occur. If liquidity is less than
€20,000,000 a “Hard Minimum Liquidity Breach” shall occur.

The financial covenants set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be tested on a quarterly basis. The minimum liquidity
set out in paragraph (c) shall be tested on a monthly basis. As of March 31, 2024, the Group complied with all financial
covenants as set out above.

According to the financing agreements the Facilities mature on the date falling four years from the date of acquisition of
Galapagos BidCo Group (i.e., October 8, 2023), subject to an automatic one-year extension (i.e., October 9, 2024). The
extension occurs provided that the annual financial statements delivered by the Issuer for the period ending December 31,
2023, do not contain any qualification as to the ability of the New Group to continue as a going concern (unless that
qualification arises as a result of the RCF maturing on the Original Termination Date). As the annual financial statements for
the period ending December 31, 2023, did not contain such qualification, which was reported to the Agent of the Facilities
on 12 June 2023.

In Q1 2024 the maturity of the facilities had been extended to June 9[th], 2025. The interest rates have been increased by
0,5%.

## 5. Financial risk management

As a global Group, Mangrove Group is in its normal course of business exposed to various financial risks such as liquidity,

currency, interest rate, procurement prices, and credit risks that could affect its net assets, financial position, and results of

operations. It is the company’s policy to use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risks associated with operating

1 EBITDA LTM – last twelve months, for Q1 2024 it’s a period from April 01, 2023, till March 31, 2024


-----

activities and the resulting financing requirements. The Group does not invest in derivatives for trading purposes. The

various risks and the current exposure have not significantly changed compared to the risks described within Note 3 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements of Mangrove Group as of December 31, 2023 (we refer to page 66 of the Consolidated

Financial Statements 2023 of the Group).

## 6. Capital reserve

Based on the shareholder resolution dated March 11, 2020, the sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à. r.l. contributed

EUR 140,000,000 to the capital contribution account (account 115 “apport en capitaux propres non rémunéré par des

titres” of the Luxembourg Standard Chart of Accounts) of the Company. Pursuant to a shareholder resolution as of

December 22, 2020, the Company’s sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à. r.l. acknowledged to convert an aggregated

amount of EUR 136,528,353 into tracking preferred equity certificates (“TPECs”). The Company issued 13,652,835,300

TPECs, holding a value of EUR 0.01 each, representing a total issue of EUR 136,528,353. The subscription of the TPECs was

dated December 31, 2020. Following the TPECs issuance and as part of the required security package in relation to certain

facilities agreements entered into by the Company (including a EUR 65 million revolving facility, a EUR 190 million facilities

agreement and a senior secured note indenture), the Company granted the TPECs pledge to the benefit of the Security

Agent and entered into the TPECs pledge agreement for the purpose thereof. The capital reserve as of March 31, 2024,

amounts to EUR 3,471,647 (as of December 31, 2023: EUR 3,471,647).

## 7. Tracking preferred equity certificates / Shareholder loan

The company acquired Galapagos BidCo Group on October 9, 2019. Financing of the acquisition was done inter alia by a

bridge loan of EUR 140,000 thousand provided to the Company by the indirect shareholder Mangrove LuxCo I S. à r.l. on

October 9, 2019. The final maturity date for the loan is four years after the date of the transaction, i.e., October 8, 2023.

The loan does not accrue interest for the first six months after the transaction date.

After the transaction date Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l. transferred the loan agreement and the EUR 140.000.000 loan

receivable to its subsidiary Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l. which is the sole shareholder of the Company. On March 11, 2020,

Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l. contributed the loan receivable in the full amount of EUR 140,000 thousand to the capital

contribution account (account 115 “apport en capitaux proprex non rémunéré par des titres” of the Luxembourg Standard

Chart of Accounts) of the Company.

With Shareholder resolution as of December 22, 2020, the sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l. to convert an

aggregated amount of EUR 136,528.353 thousand into tracking preferred equity certificates (“TPECS”). The company issued

13,652,835,300 TPECS, having a value of EUR 0.01 each, representing a total issue of EUR 136,528.353 thousand. As of

March 31, 2024, TPECs are recognized at EUR 173,410.429 thousand including an interest of EUR 2,829.929 thousand

(March 31, 2023: EUR 2,798.831 thousand). Following the TPECs issuance and as security package in relation to certain

facilities agreements entered into by the Company (including a EUR 65 million revolving facility, a EUR 190 million facilities

agreement and a senior secured note indenture), the Company granting the TPECs Pledge to the benefit of the Security

Agent and entered into the TPECs Pledge Agreement for the purpose thereof.

These TPECs are junior to all other debt of the Group and cannot be withdrawn by the shareholder under the existing

financing agreements. Therefore, these TPECs are equity like instruments and are being disclosed in the Condensed

consolidated Statement of Financial Position of the Group between equity and liabilities and are summed up together with

the equity to the line item “Equity and tracking preferred equity certificates / shareholder loan”.

EUR 84,317 thousand) are secured.

The gross amount due to customers for contract work is the aggregate amount of orders whose progress billings exceed
the capitalized cost plus the contract gains and losses recognized.

## 9. Financial instruments

The following tables provide an overview of the composition of financial instruments as of March 31, 2024, by class within

the meaning of IFRS 7 as well as by measurement category.

Trade receivables´ measurement in accordance with IFRS 15 (Trade receivables) includes primarily capitalized contract

costs, PoC-gross profit earned to date less progress billings. Other financial assets measured in accordance with other IFRS

consist mainly lease liabilities measured in accordance with IFRS 16.

The following financial instruments mostly fall under the amortized cost category as these are “hold” to collect contractual

cash flows: trade receivables (not tendered), cash and other financial assets (e.g., other operating receivables). These

financial assets measured at amortised cost meet the SPPI test. Other financial investments which include mainly

derivatives are recognised under the Fair Value through profit and loss. The remeasurement of the investments has not

revealed any significant changes to the book value.

Financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, or for which a fair value is disclosed in the Notes to the

Condensed consolidated financial statements, are required to be categorized according to the fair value hierarchy as

described in the following.

Categorization within the levels of the fair value hierarchy is based on the measurement of the underlying inputs:

Level 1 inputs: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial assets and liabilities.

Level 2 inputs: quoted market prices that are observable as direct (prices) or indirect (derived from prices) inputs used to

measure fair value and that are not quoted prices as defined by Level 1.

Level 3 inputs: inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The following table shows the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities into the three-level fair value

hierarchy.

value because of short-term nature.

Financial asserts categorised at Level 2 mostly consist of forward exchange contracts. Their fair value is determined using

quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date.

## 10.Segment reporting

The Segment Reporting of the Mangrove Group focuses on the four segments “Refrigeration Technologies” (“RT”),

“Machine Cooling Systems” (“MCS”), “Plate Heat Exchangers” (PHE”) and “Kelvion Thermal Solutions” (“KTS”). These

“segments” had previously the status of being Kelvion’s “business units”. All segments are responsible for its respective

markets and applications and focus on a distinct technology and product portfolio.

## 11.Related party disclosures

Pursuant to IAS 24 persons or entities that (jointly) control or are (jointly) controlled by Mangrove Group shall be disclosed,

unless they are included in the Condensed consolidated financial statements.

The disclosure obligation under IAS 24 furthermore extends to transactions with persons who exercise a significant

influence on the financial and business policies of the Mangrove Group. A significant influence on the financial and business

policies of the Mangrove Group can hereby be based on a shareholding of 20 percent or more of Mangrove, a seat in the

management board of Mangrove Group or another key management position on board either of the parent of Mangrove

Group or on lower level holding company.

Related parties of the Mangrove Group in accordance with IAS 24 primarily comprise the shareholders of the Mangrove

and the subsidiaries of Mangrove Group, which are not consolidated due to materiality reasons.

All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm's length basis.

As of the reporting date, no transactions between Mangrove Group companies and joint ventures or non-consolidated
companies were occurred.

**Transactions with other related parties**

The Group incurred advisory costs from a Triton related advisory company amounting to EUR 70 thousand (December 31,
2023: EUR 293 thousand).

Additionally, the Group has financial liabilities towards Triton Fund IV amounting to EUR 4,250 thousand (December 31,

2023: EUR 4,172 thousand) as well as EUR 542 thousand (December 31, 2023: EUR 542 thousand) towards Galapagos MidCo

S.à r.l. and EUR 22 thousand (December 31, 2023: EUR 22 thousand) towards Triton MasterluxCo S.à. r.l.

## 12.Remuneration of Mangrove Group management

The remuneration of the key operating management of Mangrove Group is composed of the following components:

(EUR thousand) **1Q 2024** **1Q 2023**

Short term 707 943

Termination benefits  -  
Post-employment benefits 15 15

Share-based payments  -  
**Total** **722** **958**

Short-term remuneration for 1Q 2023 includes allocated actual variable payout made in April 2024, while 1Q 2024 short

## 13.Bank guarantees

Mangrove Holding Group companies utilised bank guarantees in the amount of EUR 104.0 million (as of December 31, 2023:
EUR 141.4 million). A major part of the lines is granted by a bank consortium (total line EUR 190 million, thereof EUR 88,1
million utilised).

## 14.Litigation

A number of claims have been brought arising out of the financial restructuring of 2019 (the “Restructuring”). These have

now either been irrevocably withdrawn (Luxembourg, NY) or the relevant Mangrove entities prevailed in now final and

unappealable judgments (Germany, England)


-----

The insolvency proceedings in respect of Galapagos SA remain contested as between Kebekus (Germany) and the Official

Receiver (UK), however management (based on legal advice and the judgments in England and Germany) does not perceive

there to be any risk to the efficacy of the restructuring nor of claims against Mangrove entities, as a result of such

proceedings. Neither of the insolvency practitioners has suggested it will seek to assert a claim against any of the Mangrove

entities and the types of claim that would be theoretically possible have already been resolved via the binding judgments

noted above.

## 15.Global economic outlook 2024

As described in the section about the macroeconomic environment in this report, the Mangrove Group as a global

engineering company considers global growth in gross GDP and the corresponding forecasts to be a benchmark for its own

performance.

The Group prepared its financial budget in the fourth quarter of FY 2023 and approved it mid-December 2023 as part of

the update of its H5 Strategy in late 2023 as explained. The 2024 budget is based on the growth expectations according to

the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) from October 2023 regarding the development of the global economy as well as

estimates and expectations on the markets for heat exchange provided by a leading strategic consulting firm in 2023 and

further external sources regarding outlook from the second half of 2023 on the development of key markets. For more

details, please refer to chapter 7.3 of the management report in the Annual Financial Statements of the Group (Page 23 ff).

## 16.Events after the end of the reporting period

End of April 2024, the Group announced a restructuring to lower the capacity in two German sites. The program impact
around 150 employees. Following appropriate review and approvals the necessary provisions will be accrued in Q2 2024.

In addition, the Group started the process of refinancing all long-term financing instruments (Revolving Credit Facility,
Senior Guarantee Facility, and bonds) in Q2 2024. Completion of the refinancing is planned for Q3 2024.

### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Mangrove Group

 1. General information

##### 1.1 Company information

Luxembourg. The Company was incorporated on July 11, 2019. The purpose of the Company is the

acquisition, holding and disposal of interests in Luxembourg and/or foreign companies and undertakings as

well as the administration, development and management of such interests.

##### 1.2 Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries and

 successful Refinancing on October 9, 2019

With an effective date October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., Luxembourg, a 100 percent subsidiary

of Mangrove LuxCo III, bought 100 percent of the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg and all its

recapitalization of the operating business of the Mangrove LuxCo III, Mangrove LuxCo IV and the newly

acquired subsidiaries (collectively, the “Mangrove Group”), a deleveraging of the Mangrove Group’s balance

sheet and access to new debt facilities and instruments with longer tenors (the “Restructuring”). In

connection with the Restructuring, the Company issued EUR 356,233,492 in aggregate principal amount of

7.775 percent senior secured fixed rate notes due on October 9, 2025 (the “New Notes”).

In preparation of the aforesaid acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group the Company incorporated or acquired

the following direct and indirect subsidiaries: Incorporation of Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., Luxembourg on

July 11, 2019 and indirectly via the participation in Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. the following holding entities

in Germany were acquired on October 9, 2019: Mangrove GermanCo I GmbH, Germany and Mangrove

GermanCo II GmbH, Germany.

In the following, Mangrove LuxCo III and its consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries is referred to as

"Mangrove Group" or “the Group”.

##### 1.3 Description of the business

The Mangrove Group is a leading global manufacturer of heat exchangers and other cooling & heating


-----

products. The Group is active in multiple end markets such as Data Center, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air

Conditioning) & Refrigeration, Oil & Gas, Chemicals, Power & Energy, Transportation, Heavy & Light

Equipment, Food & Beverage. In those markets, the Group services a broad, diversified, and long-standing

customer base in more than 130 countries.

##### 1.4 Segment Reporting

Mangrove Group operates through the four Kelvion segments, “Refrigeration Technologies” (“RT”),

“Machine Cooling Systems” (“MCS”), “Plate Heat Exchangers” (“PHE”) and “Thermal Solutions” (“KTS”).

##### 1.5 The four segments of Mangrove Group

The four segments of Mangrove Group focus on distinct technologies and product portfolios:

- **Refrigeration Technologies (RT) focuses on component business for refrigeration applications with**

significant growth potential in the data center industry. RT supplies a wide range of standard and

customized heat exchangers for cooling and removing heat from different types of data centers

(hyperscale, colocation, modular etc.) using both air and liquid cooling methods. The data center market

consists of cooling solutions such as air conditioning, chilling units, economizer systems, liquid cooling

systems, control systems and includes services such as consulting, installation & deployment and

maintenance and support. The heat exchanger solutions are also used in the refrigeration market in cold

chain warehouses, supermarkets, non-residential buildings, and industrial production. Product offering

includes air cooled condensers which reject heat from refrigeration systems and are often sold as part of

a package of equipment with air coolers. RT’s customized air coolers are design-to-order units for

industrial or OEM solutions for food processing and distribution facilities. Product offering includes also

customized radiators and dry coolers which are mainly used for power and industrial applications.

Improving the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment is essential for end

users looking to reduce carbon footprint and operating costs.

- **Machine Cooling Systems (MCS) is a leading player in heat exchangers for power and engine applications**

with substantial growth opportunities by leveraging its global installed base. MCS supplies heat

exchangers for power generation, power transmission, large engine applications (marine and off-highway)

and green applications like biomass, green hydrogen, or renewable energies. The business is mostly with

OEM, e.g., for large engine manufacturers, but MCS also engages in smaller projects, like solar, wind or

solar photovoltaic. Product offering includes charge air coolers, which cool down combustion-air coming

from the turbocharger before entering the engine. MCS’ shell and tube double safety heat exchangers

assure the secure handling of safety-critical media. Product offering also includes box coolers which are

fitted in the sea chest of small and medium-sized vessels.

- **Thermal Solutions (KTS), is Kelvion’s largest segment, focusing on project business for demanding**

applications in the Oil & Gas, Chemicals Industries and, like RT, with significant growth potential in high

tech data center business as well as green tech applications such as hydrogen and Carbon Capture and

Storage (CCS). KTS’ engineering expertise plays a key role in differentiation against competitors. High

degree of geographical diversification with sites in all key region, including Europe, NAFTA, Latin America,

China and MEA. Product offering includes air fin coolers typically used for very large cooling requirements

in different industries, e.g., Oil & Gas and Chemicals, as well as air dryers which are used to remove

humidity from an air stream in various process industries. KTS’ shell & tube heat exchangers are used to

heat, cool, or condense water and other media in different process industries. The focus of the BU has

shifted in the recent years from Oil & Gas and Petrochemicals to high and green tech business.


-----

- **Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) provides a broad range of plate heat exchangers for a wide variety of**

applications in terms of pressure and temperature demands for a wide range of customer industries,

ranging from HVAC and Refrigeration to Food & Beverages, Chemicals, Power, and Industrials. Product

offering includes fully welded plate heat exchangers which are used to save energy in demanding high

pressure and temperature applications, as well as brazed plate heat exchangers, often used for

environmentally friendly heat pump applications. PHE’s gasketed heat exchangers have the highest

efficiency and flexibility and are used in a variety of industries as well as for heat recovery applications.

In contrast to the project driven segment KTS, the three segments RT, MCS and PHE represent the

component type business of the Group and form together “Kelvion Products” (“KP”). All four segments hold

strong favorable market positions in their respective markets. MCS and PHE are among the TOP 3, RT

amongst the Top 5 and KTS is niche-market leader.

In addition to the above segments there is the fifth Service segment, which is a virtual segment, i.e.,
Service is not separated from the four segments but managed globally and centrally across segments.


-----

### 2. Reporting and Accounting principles

##### 2.1 Going-concern basis of accounting

**Preparation of consolidated financial statements**

With effective date December 21, 2022, the Group agreed with the lenders to reset the financial covenants,

to which the Actual 2023 met sufficient headroom. Based on the good start to the year, management of the

Group expects the financial performance for the full year to exceed budget. With current market conditions

and business performance, the Group does not see any current risk to complying with future covenant

requirements and consequently the management does not see any risk to the going concern of the Group.

Based on actual planning the Group will be at every time and in the upcoming year in the position to meet

all financial obligations.

Therefore, the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group have been prepared on a going
concern basis.

##### 2.2 Basis of presentation

The presented consolidated financial statements cover the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31,

2023 with the prior period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.

The consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group - which comprise the consolidated statement of

financial position, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive

income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes

to the consolidated financial statements - include Mangrove LuxCo III and its direct and indirect subsidiaries

(hereinafter referred to as “Mangrove Group” or the “Group”). The consolidated financial statements have

been prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting standards as adopted by the EU. All IFRS Accounting

standards and interpretations in effect for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, have been

applied.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro (EUR), the functional currency of the group, and

presented in thousand of euros (EUR thousand) or in millions of euros (EUR million). Due to rounding, figures

presented may result in differences of EUR 1 thousand in certain cases.

To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated

income statement have been aggregated and are explained accordingly in the Notes. Assets and liabilities

are classified into current and non-current items. Current assets are expected to be realised within 12

months after the reporting period and current liabilities are due to be settled within 12 months after the

reporting period. The consolidated income statement is prepared using the cost of sales method.

The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method for cash flows from

operating activities and the direct method for cash flows from investing and financing activities.

The accounting and measurement principles are presented and explained in detail in note 2.8. The

consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Managers on April 15, 2024.

##### 2.3 First-time adoption of new accounting pronouncements

The Group applied for the first time all standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods

beginning on January 1, 2023. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group is not

significant. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendments that were


-----

issued but are not yet effective.

##### 2.3.1 Accounting regulations applied for the first time in the year

 2023

   - **Amendments to IFRS 17 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts replaces IFRS 4 and for the first time sets out standard requirements

for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts,

reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Under

the IFRS 17 measurement model, groups of insurance contracts are measured based on the

expected value of discounted cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risks as

well as a contractual service margin that results in the recognition of profit in line with the

provision of services.

The amendments add a transition option aimed to improve the usefulness of comparative

information presented on initial application of both IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 and introduce the option

of applying a "classification overlay approach". This option can be applied when IFRS 17 and IFRS

9 are applied simultaneously for the first time and no "restatement" of a financial asset with regard

to the comparative information of IFRS 9 in 2022 is made.

   - **Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

Disclosure of Accounting Policies: The amendment to IAS 1 requires that only "material"

accounting policies are presented in the notes instead of significant accounting policies.

It clarifyies that accounting policies related to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions

are themselves immaterial and do not need to be disclosed; and that not all accounting policies

relating to material transactions, other events or conditions are themselves material.

The amendments to Practice Statement 2 accordingly indicate how the concept of materiality is

applied to the disclosure of accounting policies.

   - **Amendments to IAS 8 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

Definition of Accounting Estimates: The amendments clarify how companies should distinguish

changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates, taking into account that

changes in accounting policies are applied retrospectively, whereas changes in accounting

estimates are applied prospectively.

The changes to IAS 8 focus entirely on accounting estimates and clarify the definition of a change

in accounting estimates by introducing a new definition of accounting estimates. Under the new

definition, acounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to

measurement uncertainty”.

   - **Amendments to IAS 12 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction: The amendment

restricts the exemption from (initial) recognition of deferred taxes to the extent that it no longer

applies to transactions in which companies recognise both an asset and a liability (for example,

leases and asset retirement obligations). Deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognised for

such transactions in future, insofar as deductible and taxable temporary differences of the same

amount arise.

   - **Amendments to IAS 12 (International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules)**

The KELVION group has adopted "International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules”


-----

(Amendments to IAS 12) upon their release on 23 May 2023. The amendments provide a

temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is

effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure, which are

addressed in section "Income Taxes - Global minimum top-up tax".

The mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to

implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted at 31 December 2022, in any

jurisdiction in which the KELVION group operates and no related deferred tax was recognised at

that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the KELVION group 's consolidated

financial statements.

##### 2.3.2 Accounting regulations not applied in advance of their

 effective date

The following standards and amendments to existing standards of possible relevance to the Group, which

were adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) but are not yet mandatory, have not been applied

early:

   - **Amendments to IAS 1 (Effective January 1, 2024)**

Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current: The amendments to IAS 1 only affect the

presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position. They clarify that a liability is

classified as non-current if the entity has a substantive right at the reporting date to defer

settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. The mere existence

of a substantial right is sufficient; the company does not have to intend to exercise this right.

Significant effects on the consolidated financial statements are not expected. Due to the COVID
19 pandemic, the date of initial application was postponed to 1 January 2024.

Non-current Liabilities with Covenants: The supplementary amendment to IAS 1 clarifies that if the

right to defer payment is linked to the fulfilment of conditions that must be met within twelve

months of the balance sheet date, these conditions have no influence on the classification as

current or non-current. Extended disclosures on liabilities classified as non-current with covenants

are required for risk assessment. No material effects on the consolidated financial statements are

expected.

   - **Ammendments to IFRS 16 (Effective January 1, 2024)**

Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback: The objective of the Amendments is to specify how a seller
lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to be accounted for as a sale. The lease liability

must be measured in such a way that no gain or loss arises on subsequent measurement in relation

to the retained right-of-use asset. The Amendments become effective for annual periods

beginning on or after 1 January 2024, with earlier application permitted. No material effects on

the consolidated financial statements are expected.

These new standards and amendments to existing standards will be applied by the Group starting in fiscal

2024 or later.

##### 2.4 Accounting pronouncements not yet endorsed by the EU

The IASB issued the following standards and amendments to existing standards of relevance to the Group,

which still have to be adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) before they become applicable:


-----

   - **Amendments to IAS 21 (Effective January 1, 2025)**

Lack of Exchangeability: The amendment clarifies how to specify when a currency is exchangeable

into another currency and how a company estimates a spot rate when a currency lacks

exchangeability (e.g. due to government directives). A currency is exchangeable when an entity is

able to exchange that currency for the other currency through markets or exchange mechanisms

that create enforceable rights and obligations without undue delay at the measurement date and

for a specified purpose. A currency is not exchangeable into the other currency if an entity can

only obtain an insignificant amount of the other currency. When a currency is not exchangeable,

a company needs to estimate a spot rate. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods

beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Earlier application is permitted. Significant effects on the

consolidated financial statements are not expected.

   - **Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 (Effective January 1, 2024)**

Supplier Finance Arrangements: The amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements

for companies that enter into these arrangements. They do not change the classification and

presentation of the related liabilities and cash flows.

The amendments relate to disclosure requirements in connection with supplier financing

arrangements (supply chain financing, trade payables financing or reverse factoring

arrangements) and include

          - disclosures on terms and conditions of those financing arrangements,

          - the amounts of the liabilities that are the subject of such agreements,

          - for which part of these arrangements the suppliers have already received payments

from the financiers,

          - under which item these liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet,

          - maturity date ranges and

          - information on liquidity risk.

The amendments are to be applied for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024, but

for the Group only after corresponding EU endorsement. Significant effects on the consolidated

financial statements are not expected.

##### 2.5 Basis of consolidation

**Consolidated entities**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Mangrove LuxCo III and its direct

and indirect subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are generally

prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, except of the Indian subsidiary and the

Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg, consistently applying group IFRS accounting policies. The financial

year ends due to local Indian commercial law on March 31, each year. This company was incorporated in

the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group on the basis of interim financial statements.

All intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group

transactions, are eliminated.

The consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group include Mangrove LuxCo III and all material

companies which Mangrove LuxCo III controls directly or indirectly. Companies are consolidated as of the

date on which control is obtained by Mangrove LuxCo III. They are deconsolidated as of the date on which

control is lost.

In addition to the ultimate parent company, 54 (2022: 55 companies) were consolidated.


-----

In May 2023, the former fully consolidated ENEXIO ACC GmbH, Bochum was sold and deconsolidated.

The scope of consolidation changed as follows:

**Number of companies** **2023** **2022**

**Consolidated Group as of January 1** **55** **55**

Acquisition - 4

Merger - 1

Liquidation - 1

Deconsolidation 1 2

**Consolidated Group as of December 31** **54** **55**

Domestic companies Luxembourg 4 4

Foreign companies 50 51

A list of companies included in the consolidated financial statements and of all companies, in which

Mangrove LuxCo III has interests in, is provided in Note “12. List of companies included in the consolidated

financial statements”.

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control is assumed, when the following three criteria

are fulfilled:

(1) the parent company holds decision-making power over the relevant activities of the investee,

(2) the company has rights to variable returns from the investee and

(3) the parent company can use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns.

The fulfillment of these criteria is assessed based on corporate governance and potential supplementary

agreements.

Companies that are dormant or do not have significant impact on the financial position and results of

operation of the Group are not included in the consolidated financial statements.

A total of two (2022: three) companies are not consolidated.

In April 2023, the Bloksam Asia Ltd, Hong Kong was dissolved.

The aggregate assets, equity, revenues and earnings of these companies are not material to the

consolidated financial statements. The subsidiaries are recognised at cost as non-current other financial

assets. Management deems the influence to the Group as absolutely insignificant and hence, the disclosure

required under IFRS has not been made due to materiality reason. The disclosure of this information is not

suitable to communicate additional information.

**Interests in associated companies and joint ventures**

Associated are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but no control or joint control,

over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joined

control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets

and obligations for its liabilities. Interests in associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using

the equity method and at cost in case the company is not material. They are initially recognised at cost,

which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements

include the Group's share of profit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees, until the date on which

significant influence or joint control ceases for those that are accounted at equity.

One associated company is accounted at cost since it is not material.

Management deems the influence of the associated company to the financial position of the Group as


-----

insignificant.

##### 2.6 Currency translation

The Mangrove Group companies prepare their annual financial statements on the basis of their respective

functional currencies.

Foreign currency transactions entered into by companies included in the consolidated financial statements

are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary

assets and liabilities are translated at the applicable exchange rate at each reporting date. Exchange rate

gains and losses resulting from these items are generally reported in the income statement under other

income or expenses. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical acquisition or production cost in

a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transaction. Non-monetary

items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as of the date

when the fair value was determined.

All financial statements of companies whose functional currencies differ from the reporting currency are

translated into the reporting currency used in the consolidated financial statements. The assets and

liabilities of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are translated at the middle

rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income statements of these companies are translated at the

average rates for the period under review. If these average rates are not a reasonable approximation of the

actual transaction rates, the income statements are translated at the relevant transaction rates. Any

translation differences are recognised and subsequently adjusted in other comprehensive income.

The following material foreign exchange rates are used for the currency conversion:

##### 2.7 Material accounting and valuation policies

**Business combination and Goodwill**

Acquired companies are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration paid is measured

on the basis of the fair value of the assets received, the liabilities assumed from the seller, and the equity

instruments issued at the transaction date. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent

liabilities assumed in the business combination are recognised at their fair value at the transaction date,

irrespective of any non-controlling interests. Any contingent consideration agreed is recognised at fair value

at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

The excess of cost over the share of the fair value of the company’s net assets acquired is recognised as

goodwill. If, after a further examination, cost is lower than the share of the fair value of the subsidiary’s

acquired net assets measured at fair value, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.


-----

Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed within the period they occur.

Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets

at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control

are accounted for as equity transactions.

Where a subsidiary is disposed of, such that control is no longer held, the entity is removed from the

consolidation as at the date when control ceases.

If individual group companies have a different reporting date, they are included on the basis of interim

financial statements as of the respective reporting date.

**Goodwill**

**Determination of Goodwill**

Goodwill arising from business combinations in which a Mangrove Group company acts as the acquirer is

recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the

fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. It comprises

workforce, sustainability of the business, further evolutionary technology leadership and strategic premium.

**Impairment of Goodwill**

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the level of Mangrove Group’s segments, which have been identified

as cash-generating units. For the purposes of impairment testing, the goodwill arising from the recognition

of business combinations is allocated to the segments and segments that are expected to benefit from the

synergies generated by the business combination. If more than one segment (or business unit) profits from

an acquisition, the allocation is carried out using an appropriate allocation key.

Goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually and in situations of impairment indications. The

recoverable amount of a segment or business unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill.

The recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs of

disposal. Until the date this consolidated financial statement was prepared, there was no indication that the

goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amount of a segment or business unit is compared with its carrying amount including

goodwill. The recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs

of disposal and is calculated annually at the end of the fiscal year using a discounted cash flow method.

An impairment loss initially reduces the carrying amount of goodwill. Any amount exceeding goodwill is

allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non-current non-financial assets. These reductions in

the carrying amounts are treated as impairment losses in the profit and loss statement.

**Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets include both internally generated and purchased assets. Internally generated

intangible assets comprise capitalised development costs. In addition to contract-based rights, purchased

intangible assets mainly contain technologies, brand names, and customer relationships. Technologies,

brand names, and customer relationships are usually acquired in connection with acquisitions. Internally

generated and acquired intangible assets are recognised at cost. If the useful life of an intangible asset can

be determined, following its initial recognition, the asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful

life. Acquisition cost and conversion cost includes borrowing costs as long as the criteria are met. In financial

years 2022 and 2023 no borrowing costs have been capitalised.

The carrying amount of an intangible asset is reviewed in case it is likely to be impaired by events or changes

in circumstances. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least once a


-----

year. This requires the recoverable amount of the assets to be determined. The recoverable amount

corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. If the carrying amount

is higher than the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired to the recoverable amount. Previously

recognised impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer apply. Impairment

losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortised historical cost.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and any

impairment losses, plus reversals of impairment losses. Cost also includes borrowing costs as long as the

recognition criteria are met. In financial year 2023 no borrowing costs have been capitalised. Land is not

subject to scheduled depreciation. All other assets are depreciated over the expected useful life of the

assets.

Expenses for major regular maintenance are amortised over the remaining useful life of the asset concerned

or over the period to the next maintenance date.

The carrying amount of items of property, plant and equipment is reviewed in case it is likely to be impaired

by events or changes in circumstances. An impairment test is performed by comparing the asset’s carrying

amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of internal value in

use and fair value less costs to sell (net realisable value). Fair value is primarily determined on the basis of

the current local market price for used machinery or commercial real estate. If the carrying amount exceeds

the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. To assess impairment, assets are grouped at the

lowest level for which separate cash flows can be identified. If the reason for the impairment subsequently

ceases to apply, the impairment loss is reversed up to a maximum of the amortised historical cost.

**Leases**

At inception of a contract, Mangrove Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract

is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period

of time in exchange for consideration.

**Leases as a lessee**

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, Mangrove Group

allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone

prices. However, for the leases of property the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components

and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group recognises a

right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially

measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments

made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs

to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is

located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the

straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers

ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use

asset reflects that Mangrove Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will

be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those

of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses,

if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured

at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using

the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental

borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.


-----

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external

financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset

leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

   - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

   - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate

as at the commencement date;

   - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and

   - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease

payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension

option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to

terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when

there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in

the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the

Mangrove Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination

option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying

amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use

asset has been reduced to zero.

**Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets**

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets

and short-term leases, including IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with

these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Leases as a lessor**

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, Mangrove Group allocates

the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices.

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or

an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially

all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease

is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain

indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease

separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising

from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which

the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the

consideration in the contract.

The Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the

lease. The Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the

gross investment in the lease.


-----

**Other financial assets**

Other financial assets include investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments,

other securities, financial receivables (except trade receivables), derivative financial instruments, bonds and

bank loans.

According to IFRS 9 Shares in unconsolidated subsidiaries are allocated to the “fair value through other

comprehensive income” (FVOCI) measurement category. A financial asset is measured at fair value through

OCI if the objective of the business model is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial

assets. Mangrove Group has opted to recognise future changes in their fair value through other

comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income and to continue to classify them as

equity upon the derecognition of the financial instrument. As for new instruments, Mangrove Group can

opt to make use of this option on an instrument-by-instrument basis upon recognition, but it must continue

to do so thereafter.

Financial assets included within the fair value through OCI category are initially recognised and subsequently

measured at fair value. Movements in the carrying amount should be recorded through OCI. The fair value

assessment of the investements was insignificant.

According to IFRS 9 Financial receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest

method. The effective interest method has no effect as the financial receivables are short-term. According

to IFRS 9 the sold receivables need to be remeasured as Fair value through profit and loss. Due to the

recoverability of sold trade receivables the fair value is equal to the amortised costs.

Derivative financial instruments are used exclusively for hedging purposes, in particular to economically

hedge currency risk which arises mainly from sales and procurement transactions. Fair value changes are

carried at fair value through profit and loss. Hedge Accounting in the sence of IFRS 9 is not applied.

Embedded financial derivatives are separated from their host contracts, which are not measured at fair

value through profit or loss, if the economic characteristics and the risk of the embedded derivative are not

closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Separable embedded

derivatives are measured at fair value at initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting date. The fair

value of the embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option price model. For the valuation, the

credit spread used is calibrated to make the model reproduce the current market price at the valuation date.

Following initial recognition, changes in fair value is recognised through profit or loss. Mangrove Group has

identified certain options embedded in the indentures and hence, separated it from the host contract.

Financial assets or groups of financial assets, which are not measured as amortised costs, are tested for

indications of impairment at each reporting date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income

statement. If one or more events occurred after initial recognition of the asset and there is objective

evidence that the expected future cash flows decline, financial assets are impaired. Objective evidence of

impairment may be, for example, significant financial difficulties of the debtor or payment default. In the

case of financial assets measured at amortised cost (e.g. unquoted equity instruments), the impairment loss

corresponds to the difference between the carrying amount of the financial instrument and the present

value of the future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.

Financial assets are recognised as soon as Mangrove Group receives a cash payment or has the right to

receive cash flows. In the case of regular sales of non-derivative financial assets, the settlement date (i.e.,

the delivery date of the financial assets) is decisive. Assets are derecognised as soon as the right to receive

cash payments or other financial assets expires as a result of payment, waiver, statutory limitation,

offsetting, or any other factor. The same applies if the right is transferred to another person, with the risks

passing in full to the acquirer. In the case of regular way sales of non-derivative financial assets, the


-----

settlement date is taken to be the date of derecognition, in line with the principle used for recognition.

If the reasons for impairment no longer apply, impairment losses on financial assets – with the exception of

equity instruments – are reversed to income up to the amount of the amortised cost / net realisable value

that would have applied if no impairment loss had been charged.

**Inventories**

Inventories are recognised at cost and measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Acquisition

cost is calculated at average cost or using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Production cost includes direct

costs plus materials and production overheads, depreciation, and production-related administrative costs.

Net realisable value is calculated as the estimated sale proceeds less costs incurred until completion and

selling expenses. Previously recognised impairment losses must be reversed if the reasons for the

impairment no longer apply. Impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortised historical

cost.

Acquisition cost and conversion cost include borrowing costs as long as the criteria are met. In financial years

2022 and 2023 no borrowing costs have been capitalised.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables include no interest component and are recognised with their principal amount less

appropriate allowances for bad debts. Trade receivables are measured as amortised costs. The gross

carrying amount is not calculated by the effective interest method as all of Group´s trade receivables are

short-term.

The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract

assets. Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal

to lifetime expected credit losses. Exposures within each credit risk grade are segmented by geographic

region and the loss rate is calculated for each region based on actual credit loss experience over the past

three years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors (gdp growth rates) to reflect differences between

economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions

and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

Trade receivables sold to financial services companies under factoring agreements are derecognised once

the majority of risks and rewards have been transferred to the financial services company. According to IFRS

9 this amount has to be remeasured as fair value through profit and loss because these are no longer

categorised as hold-to-collect when sold.

For factored receivables the principal is regularly paid earlier by the factoring bank than cash would have

been obtained from the customer. Due to the recoverability of sold trade receivables the fair value is equal

to the amortised costs.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and cash deposits with maturities of three months or less

from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in fair value.

**Obligations under pension plans**

Obligations under pension plans relate to post-employment benefit obligations. Defined benefit obligations

are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The present value of these obligations reflects

expected future salary and pension trends, since the entitlements earnable in the period up to the


-----

retirement age depend on those. The pension obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial reports by

independent actuaries.

In order to provide those pension benefits, financial assets are held in long-term funds outside Mangrove

Group and qualifying insurance policies. As long as as the entitlements are funded by such external assets

(plan assets), their fair value is offset against the present value of the defined benefit obligation. The

resulting net amount is reported under non-current employee benefit obligations or other non-current

financial assets (net carrying amount).

Actuarial gains and losses from the remeasurement of the net carrying amount are recognised in other

comprehensive income of the year in which they arise and are reported in other comprehensive income

after adjustment for tax effects. This also applies to the recognition of the difference between the actual

returns on plan assets and the expected return calculated using the discount rate. Net interest – comprising

interest income on plan assets and interest cost on the defined benefit obligation – on the net carrying

amount is recognised in interest expenses. Current and past service cost for the period as well as gains and

losses from settlements are recognised in the respective functional areas as cost.

**Other employee benefit obligations**

Other employee benefit obligations comprise other long-term benefits and all short-term benefits. The

short-term obligations from short-term employee benefits are expected to be paid in full not later than 12

months after completion of the rendered service. They include wages, salaries, social insurance

contributions, paid vacation, and profit-sharing schemes. They are recognised as an expense simultanously

as the work is performed. Any expenditure in excess of the payments already made is reported as a deferred

liability at the reporting date. Other long-term employee benefits, such as jubilee payments or partial

retirement arrangements, are recognised at the actuarial present value of the obligation at the reporting

date. Securities are pledged to the beneficiaries to protect vested partial retirement credits against the

employer’s insolvency. The fair value of these securities is offset against the corresponding liability.

**Provisions**

Provisions for uncertain liabilities are recognised in case of a legal or constructive obligation to a third party,

a future outflow of resources is likely, and if the expected settlement value can be estimated reliably. The

present value of the settlement amount is recognised if the time value of money is material. Amounts are

discounted at the market rates for the appropriate maturity and currency. The interest unwinding costs are

presented under interest expense.

**Warranty Provisions**

The cost of creating warranty provisions is included in the cost of sales when revenue is recognised. The

provision is measured on the basis of both the warranty cost actually incurred in the past and on the

evaluated overall risk inherent in the system or product. Provisions are also recognised if a claim is made

under a warranty and a loss is likely. Recourse claims against suppliers are capitalised if their services are

subject to a warranty and it is highly likely that the claim can be enforced. The group does not identify any

performance obligations on the sence of IFRS 15.

**Provisions for onerous contracts**

Provisions for expected losses from onerous contracts are recognised if the unavoidable costs of meeting

the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The

unavoidable costs also include the unavoidable overheads needed to meet the obligations.


-----

**Provisions for restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring

plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicity. Future operating losses

are not provided for.

**Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities in particular include derivatives, preferred equity certificates, bonds, liabilities to banks

and liabilities under finance leases. They are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. They are

subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Liabilities under finance

leases are initially measured at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of

minimum lease payments.

**Other liabilities**

The recognition and subsequent measurement of other liabilities is the same as for financial liabilities, with

the exception of advance payments and the gross amount due to customers for contract work. Advance

payments are stated at their principal amount. Please see the information provided on the recognition of

construction contracts for the measurement of the gross amount due to customers for contract work.

**Contract assets and liabilities**

Other contract assets are recognised if the contract costs incurred and the gains recognised exceed the

progress billings and advance payments received or due. Advance payments on orders and the gross amount

due to customers for contract work are carried under “contract liabilities”. Advance payments on orders are

statet at their nominal amount. If the advance payments received or due exceed the capitalised costs and

recognised gains, less the progress billings at the reporting date, they are reported as a liability under

contract liabilities.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables also include liabilities for goods received or services rendered that have not yet been

invoiced, as there is only slight uncertainty of the amount of the liability. Trade payables are recognised at

amortised costs. This corresponds to the settlement amount in the case of liabilities due within one year.

**Revenue Recognition**

The Mangrove Group reports revenue according to three revenue types, namely construction contracts,

sale of goods and services and service agreements:

   - Revenues from construction contracts are recognised over time in accordance with IFRS 15

(“percentage-of-completion method”) since the customer obtains control through their

specifications over the duration of the contract and because the Mangrove Group is entitled

to reimbursement of the costs incurred so far, plus an appropriate margin, if the customer

cancels a contract. The percentage-of-completion is determined using the cost-to-cost

method, which is derived from the ratio of contract costs incurred to the total estimated

contract costs as of the reporting date. Contract costs include direct costs plus materials and

construction overheads, depreciation, production-related administrative costs, and such

other costs that are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the contract.

Adjustments are made for variations in contract work, claims, and incentive payments insofar

as these will probably result in revenue that is capable of being reliably estimated. Changes

in estimates or differences between the estimated cost and the actual cost have a direct


-----

impact on recognised earnings from construction contracts. In addition, estimation limits

must be observed. In line with this method, construction contracts are measured at the

amount of the contract costs incurred as of the reporting date plus the profit attributable to

the proportion of work completed. The costs incurred and the related profits are reported

under contract assets, less progress billings and advance payments received or due. If, while

a performance obligation is being satisfied, the contract costs incurred are not proportionate

to the progress of the performance of said contract, revenues will be recognised only to the

extent of the contract costs incurred (“zero-profit-method”). A profit is only recognised when

the contract costs incurred are matched by corresponding progress of the performance of

the contract. Contract costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are

incurred. If it is foreseeable that total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the

expected loss is recognised as an impending loss according to IAS 37.

   - Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when such goods are transferred

to the customer, or when services were carried out, and the contractual performance

obligations are therefore met. Performance obligations are satisfied as the customer obtains

control over the goods sold to them, i.e., when they can direct the use of and obtain

essentially all the remaining benefits from the goods.

   - Revenue from service agreements is recognised over the period in which the service is

performed. If only the sale of spare parts is involved, revenue is recognised at a specific point

in time.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received. Customer

bonuses, discounts, or rebates reduce the amount of revenue recognised. Payments for differences in

the overall contract, claims, and premiums are included in the contract revenue as variable components.

The amount of such payments is calculated at contract inception using the “expected-value” method 
if there are several different possible amounts - or the “most likely amount” method - if there are just

two possible amounts. The effects of significant financing components can be ignored when

determining the amount of revenue to be recognised if the vendor expects, at contract inception, that

the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and the date of payment

will be one year or less. Discretion must be applied when judging whether revenues are to be recognised

“over time”, as well as with regard to the allocation of the transaction price to the performance

obligation. Where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, these are estimated.

The Group uses various input and output methods to ensure that revenues from contracts with

customers are faithfully represented. The portion of revenues which fall under the IFRS 15 requirements

with respect to revenue recognised over time is around 35% each year. Almost two thirds of revenue,

around 65% of sales of goods and services, is recognised at a point in time.

**Research and development**

Research expenditures are recognised immediately as an expense.

Development costs that are designed to significantly enhance a product or process are capitalised if

completion of the product or process is technically and economically feasible, the development is

marketable, the expenditures can be measured reliably, and adequate resources are available to complete

the development project.

Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measures reliably, the product or

process is technically feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has

sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.


-----

Development costs that are required under construction contracts are capitalised as part of the cost of the

asset.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at fair value provided that Mangrove Group meets the conditions

necessary to receive the grant. Government grants to cover expenses are recognised over the period in

which the costs for which the grants were awarded are incurred. Government grants for capital expenditure

are deducted from the cost of purchasing the corresponding asset.

**Income Tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent

that it relates to a business combination, or related items are recognised directly in equity or in other

comprehensive income (OCI).

The KELVION group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax - which is required to pay under

Pillar Two legislation - is an income tax in the scope of IAS 12. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory

relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax

when it is incurred.

**Current Tax**

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or tax receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year

and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured on the

reporting date using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the

reporting period. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.

**Deferred taxes**

Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets

and liabilities for financial reporting and the amount used for taxation purposes. Deferred taxes are not

recognised for:

   - Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not

a business combination and that effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

   - Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associated and joint arrangements

to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary

differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

   - Taxable differences arising on the initial recognition on goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary

differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they

can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it

is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Such reductions are reversed when the

probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it

has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when

they reverse, using the tax rate enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.

**Single assets held for sale, discontinued operations and disposal groups**


-----

A single non-current asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally

through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The Group reports assets and liabilities as a

disposal group, that will be disposed of by sale or otherwise in a single transaction, which collectively meet

the held for sale criteria as specified in IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued

Operations”. The Group reports the assets and liabilities of a disposal group separately in the balance sheet

line item “assets held for sale” and “liabilities held for sale”, respectively. Unless a disposal group qualifies

for discontinued operations reporting, the revenues and expenses of the disposal group remain within

continuing operations until the date of disposal. The Group reports the results of a disposal group that also

qualifies as a component of the Group as discontinued operations if it represents a separate major line of

business or geographical area of operations. The Group reports the results of discontinued operations in the

period in which they occur separately within the consolidated statement of income as “discontinued

operations (net of tax)”. In the consolidated statement of cash flows the cash flows resulting from

discontinued operations are presented separately from cash flows resulting from continuing operations;

prior year presentation has been adjusted accordingly. In order to present the proportion of income/loss

attributable to discontinued operations, net sales and expenses arising from intercompany transactions are

recognised provided that these transactions will not continue after the disposal of the discontinued

operations.

On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets are recognised at the lower of the carrying amount

and fair value less costs to sell and depreciation and amortisation ceases. A disposal group is initially

measured in line with the respective IFRS Accounting standards to determine the carrying amount of the

disposal group which is then compared to the fair value less costs to sell of the group in order to recognise

the disposal group at the lower of both amounts. An impairment loss initially reduces the carrying amount

of goodwill. Any amount exceeding goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non
current non-financial assets. These reductions in the carrying amounts are treated as impairment losses in

the in the profit and loss statement.

##### 2.8 Estimates and management judgement

Judgement was applied in the determination of excluding subsidiaries from or including subsidiaries into

consolidation.

Preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates

that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and contingent

liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during

the period under report. While these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current

events and circumstances, actual results may ultimately differ from the estimates set forth. Estimates and

the underlying assumptions are subject to ongoing review. Revisions to estimates are recognised

prospectively.

Factors that may cause amounts to fall below estimates might include a deterioration in the global economy,

movements in exchange rates and interest rates, as well as material litigation and changes in environmental

or other legislation. Production errors, the loss of key customers, and rising borrowing costs may also

adversely affect the Group’s future performance.

The major areas subject to considerable estimating uncertainty, or to particular discretion in the application

of accounting and measurement methods, are presented in the following notes disclosure:

**Measurement of property plant and equipment, and intangible assets**


-----

Measurement of property plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the use of estimates for

determining the fair value at the acquisition date, provided they were acquired in a business combination.

Furthermore, the expected useful lives of these assets must be estimated. The determination of the fair

values of assets as well as the useful lives of the assets is based on management's judgement.

**Determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets**

The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the use

of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing, and amount of the impairment.

Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions,

expectations of growth in the heat exchanger industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future

availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services, current replacement costs,

prices paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in circumstances, which indicate that an

impairment exists. The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows

and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant

judgements concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows,

applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values.

The carrying amounts of intangible assets, items of property, plant and equipment, and groups of cash
generating units with goodwill are reviewed if they are likely to have been impaired by events or changes in

circumstances. In addition, indefinite-lived intangible assets and cash-generating units with goodwill are

tested for impairment at least once a year. The impairment test compares the asset’s carrying amount

against its recoverable amount ( “impairment test”) . The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of

internal value in use and fair value less costs of disposal ( net realisable value) . An estimate of fair value less

costs to sell is only required if the value in use is less than the carrying amount. If the carrying amount

exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognised. In this

case, the impairment loss is first deducted from the goodwill of the cash- generating unit with goodwill. Any

amount exceeding goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non- current non
financial assets.

Fair value less costs of disposal is generally the benchmark for measuring the impairment of segments

classified as “held for sale”.

The valuations of other intangible assets, which were performed as part of the impairment test, are based

on management assumptions. Previously recognised impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the

impairment no longer apply, except in the case of goodwill. Impairment losses are reversed up to a

maximum of the amortised historical cost.

In total, impairments including reversal amounting to EUR 207 thousand for property, plant and equipment

and intangible assets were to be recorded in FY 2023 (2022: EUR 3,144 thousand).

**Leases**

The Group uses estimates and judgements that affect the determination of the lease term – e.g. determining

the enforceable period and whether a lessee is reasonably certain either to exercise a renewal option or not

to exercise a termination option. The Mangrove group determines the lease term at the commencement

date. As a lessee, the group is required to reassess the lease term on the occurrence of a significant event

or change in circumstances that is within its control and directly affects whether it si reasonably certain to

exercise (or not to exercise) an option included in the original contract. Both lessees and lessors revise the

lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period. This requires ongoing monitoring and increases

financial statement volatility.


-----

Lease payments are discountinued at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readibly be determined.

Otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate, which is

mainly applied, is based on the risk adjusted interst rates and detmined for the respective lease terms and

currencies.

**Scope of consolidation**

Judgement was applied in the determination of excluding subsidiaries from consolidation on the basis of

materiality (see Note 2.6).

**Impairment**

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) on financial assets measured at

amortised cost, debt investments measured at FVOCI and contract assets. The Group measures loss

allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month

(a) ECLs debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; (b) and other debt

securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of

the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade

receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to

lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial

recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is

relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative

information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that

includes forward-looking information. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has

increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when (a) the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit

obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is

held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt

securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that

have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence

that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: (a) significant financial

difficulty of the debtor or it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial

reorganisation.

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying

amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is

recognised in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no

reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.

**Recognition and measurement on deferred tax assets and income tax uncertainties**

Mangrove Group operates in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to different tax

jurisdictions. Calculating tax liabilities requires management to make various estimates. Management

believes that it has made a reasonable estimate of tax uncertainties. However, no assurance can be given

that the actual outcome of these uncertainties will correspond to the estimates made. Any deviations may

have an impact on the level of tax liabilities or deferred taxes in the year of the decision.

When assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management judges the extent to which

realisation of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently likely. The question of whether the deferred tax assets

can actually be realised depends on whether sufficient future taxable income can be generated against


-----

which the temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards can be offset. Management therefore analyses

the times at which the deferred tax liabilities reverse, and expected future taxable income. Management

forecasts whether deferred tax assets can be realised on the basis of expected future taxable income.

Deferred tax assets decline if the estimate of planned taxable income decreases, tax benefits available as a

result of tax strategies are reduced, or the amount or timing of future tax benefits is restricted by changes

in law (see Note 6.7).

IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 when there is

uncertainty about the income tax treatment. For recognition and measurement, estimates and assumptions

must be made, e.g. whether an estimate is made separately or together with other uncertainties, a most

likely amount or expected amount for the uncertainty is used and whether changes have occurred

compared to the previous period. The risk of detection from tax authorities is irrelevant for the recognition

of uncertain balance sheet items. Accounting is based on the assumption that the tax authorities are

investigating the matter in question and that they have all relevant information at their disposal.

**Recognition and calculation of construction contracts**

Identification and definition of performance obligation, as well as timing of revenue recognition are based

on managements estimates. Further the recognition of construction contracts using the percentage of

completion method is based on management’s estimates of the cost to complete the contracts. Changes in

estimates or differences between the estimated cost and the actual cost to complete have a direct effect on

recognised earnings from construction contracts. The operating units continuously review the estimates and

adjust them if required.

**Obligations under pension plans**

The present value of pension obligations depends on actuarial assumptions. These assumptions

comprise discount rates, expected wage and salary increases, as well as the pension growth rate and

mortality rates. These assumptions can differ significantly from actual future outcomes as a result of changes

in market and economic conditions, and can therefore have a material effect on the level of the obligation

and the related expenses.

The discount rate of the net carrying amount is calculated at the end of each year. This is the rate used to

calculate the present value of future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the obligation. In order

to calculate the discount rate, Mangrove Group uses the interest rate on high-quality corporate bonds

denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are paid and whose terms to maturity correspond

to those of the pension obligations.

Other significant assumptions relating to pension obligations are based on market conditions (see Note

“ 5.4.1. Employee benefit obligations”).

**Litigation**

In some cases, Mangrove Group companies are parties to litigation. The outcome of this litigation could

have a material effect on Mangrove Group’s net assets, financial position, and results of operations.

Management regularly analyses current information on these legal disputes and recognises provisions for

probable obligations including legal costs. Both internal counsels and external lawyers make this

assessment. When deciding on the need to recognise provisions, management takes into account the

probability of an unfavorable outcome and its ability to estimate the amount of the obligation with sufficient

reliability. Material litigations described in Note “9.3 Litigation”.

**Determination of fair value of financial instruments**


-----

The level of management judgement, required in establishing the fair value of financial instruments for

which there is a quoted price in an active market, is usually minimal. Similarly there is little subjectivity or

judgement required for instruments valued using valuation models which are standard across the industry

and where all input parameters are quoted in active markets (e.g. for foreign exchange rate derivatives).

The level of subjectivity and degree of management judgement required is more significant for those

instruments valued using models and techniques where some or all of the parameter inputs are less or not

observable. Management judgement is required in the selection and application of appropriate parameters,

assumptions and modelling techniques. This applies especially in establishing the fair value of the embedded

derivatives.

### 3. Financial risk management

Mangrove Group applies guidelines and instruments, to manage and hence largely limit or hedge financial

risks throughout the Group.

The objectives with regard to protecting assets, eliminating gaps in security, and improving efficiency in

identifying and analyzing risks are clearly defined, as are the relevant organizational structures, powers, and

responsibilities. The guidelines are based on the principles of system security, separation of functions,

transparency, and immediate documentation.

Mangrove Group is exposed to currency, interest rate, commodity price, credit, and liquidity risk in the

course of its ordinary activities. Mangrove Group’s financial risk management aims to reduce this risk

through the appropriate use of derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments and avoids on principal

concentrations of risk.

**Currency risk**

The Mangrove Group has significant assets and liabilities outside the Eurozone, particularly in China, USA,

South Africa, Brazil, India, Poland, Czech Republic as well as Great Britain. These assets and liabilities are

denominated in local currency. When the net asset values are converted into euro, the currency fluctuations

result in period to period changes in those net asset values. The equity position of the Group reflects these

changes in net asset values.

The Mangrove Group also has transactional currency exposures which arise mostly from sales or purchases

in currencies other than the functional currency. In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate

fluctuations for the operating business, all companies are required to economically hedge foreign currency

items, as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates. Currency risks are economically

hedged for recognized assets and liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and highly probable

forecasted transactions, when denominated in another currency than the functional currency of the

company. The hedging periods are determined by the maturity of the economical hedged items and are

usually up to twelve months but may also exceed that period significantly in exceptional cases.

Hedge Accounting in the sense of IFRS 9 is not applied.

All economic hedging transactions - to the extent being legally permissible - are handled by Mangrove Group

Treasury. The group companies report their exposures to Group Treasury, which enters on behalf of the

respective companies into corresponding derivative transactions with banks. The economical hedging

transactions are closely monitored by Mangrove Group Treasury.

Besides the hedging requirement, currency fluctuations may affect business opportunities outside the

Eurozone.

**Interest rate risk**

The Mangrove Group is exposed to interest rate risks which mainly relate to debt obligations, as the Group

borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The interest rate risk is monitored by using the cash

flow sensitivity of the Group’s cash flows due to floating interest loans.

**Commodity price risk**

As part of its operating activities, Mangrove Group requires various raw materials, whose purchase prices

can be subject to substantial fluctuations depending on the market situation. Long-term supply agreements

have been entered into with various suppliers in order to reduce commodity price risk.


-----

**Credit risk**

The credit risk refers to the risk that counterparties may default on their contractual obligations resulting in

a financial loss to the Mangrove Group. In general Mangrove Group has adopted a policy of only dealing

with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral in form of advanced payments where

appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

The Mangrove Group monitors the exposure and the credit ratings of its existing and potential

counterparties continuously. Companies active in the component business use credit limits to assess their

counterparty default risk, whereas a maximum risk limit is defined for each party. In most cases this limit is

derived from recognized credit rating agencies and credit default swaps if available. Appropriate action is

taken if the individual limit is exceeded. Companies active in the project business ascertain the financial

standing of potential customers on a case by case basis using all available financial information. Before a

project order is accepted the assessment is additionally reviewed in an internal risk board procedure.

An appropriate credit management, including a credit insurance, is also conducted to reduce credit risk. In

the case of export transactions, confirmed and unconfirmed letters of credit are used alongside sureties,

guarantees, and cover notes, including from export credit agencies.

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across different industries and regions.

Hence there is no concentration of risk. Valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables

and contract assets as at 31 December 2023:

**Risk Cluster**
**Gross carrying amount** **Weighted average loss rate** **Loss allowance kEUR**
**EUR thousand**

Western Europe 53,940 0.65% 351

Asia Pacific 28,3010 2.17% 615

North America 53,872 0.35% 186

Rest of World 23,155 0.76% 177

**Total** **159,267** **0.83%** **1,329**

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables and contract assets during

the year was as follows:

**(EUR million)** **12/31/2023** **12/31/2022**

Opening Balance 10.9 10.5

Additions 3.5 3.0

Utilization -0.5 -0.2

Release -1.4 -2.2

Exchange difference -0.3 -0

**Closing Balance** **12.3** **10.9**

Derivative financial instruments are concluded only with financial institutions with high credit-ratings

assigned by international credit-rating agencies so as to reduce the credit risk involved.

The Mangrove Group does not have any critical credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group

of counterparties having similar characteristics. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited

because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating

agencies and also typically are lenders to the Group. Therefore, credit quality of financial assets which are

neither past due nor impaired is assessed to be good. The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial

assets is the carrying amount.


-----

**Liquidity risk**

Mangrove Group is exposed to liquidity risk in a way that it may be unable to meet payment obligations

because it has insufficient cash funds at its disposal. To manage Mangrove Group’s short, medium and long
term funding and liquidity requirements the management has established an appropriate liquidity risk

control framework consisting inter alia of a multi-year financial plan and a rolling month-by-month cash

forecast. The Group manages the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities, and

reserve borrowing facilities as well as by monitoring forecasted cash flows at regular intervals.

The cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity. In order to optimize

borrowing and the use of cash funds within the Group, cash pools in various countries are established. The

cash pools automatically balance the accounts of the participating companies every day by crediting or

debiting a target account. This prevents separate cash investments and borrowings by these companies to

a large extent.

The following table shows the undiscounted contractually agreed interest and principal payments for
financial liabilities, including derivative financial instruments with negative fair values:

*) Differences to the reported balance sheet value results from unrealized interest income of EUR 452 thousand (prior year: EUR 22,345 thousand).

All financial liabilities outstanding as of December 31, 2023, are included in the above table on the basis of

expected contractual cash flows. Projected figures for future new liabilities are not taken into account.

Foreign currency amounts are translated at the closing rates. In the case of financial liabilities that can be

repaid at any time, it is assumed that they will be repaid within one year.

Forecast scenarios are updated regularly and the Group has the ability to act to boost liquidity if necessary.

The payment comprises accrued interest and redemption.

Credit lines and guarantees are discussed in Note “8.2 Other financial obligations”.


-----

**Foreign currency sensitivity analysis**

Mangrove Group companies are always exposed to foreign currency risk if their cash flows are denominated

in a currency other than their own functional currency. Foreign currency risk is economically hedged using

suitable instruments, thus largely offsetting fluctuations arising from the economical hedged item and the

economical hedging transaction over their term.

The foreign currency risk presented in the sensitivity analysis results from the following transactions:

 - Currency derivatives that are terminated for hedging of previously unrecognized economical hedged

items, i.e., for contractually agreed or expected transactions. These hedging derivatives are affecting

profit or loss by exchange rate risk.

 - Unsecured foreign currency transactions

 - The translation of foreign currency receivables or liabilities at the closing rate has a direct effect on

earnings.

A major part of the foreign currency cash flows is settled in the currency pairs that are named in the following

table. The foreign currencies are included as relevant risk variables in the foreign currency sensitivity

analysis. The figures show the sensitivity of a 10 percent increase or decrease in the foreign currency in

relation to the base currency:


**2023**


**Profit/loss for the year** **Nominal amount** **Profit/loss for the year**

The calculation has been performed on a nominal underlying of EUR 236,515 thousand (prior year: EUR

210,078 thousand).

The nominal amount relates to all contractually agreed foreign currency cash flows as of the reporting date

which are translated into euros at the closing rate.

The potential fluctuations in the profit or loss for the year result primarily from unhedged currency.

**Interest rate sensitivity analysis**

An interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest

payments, and interest income and expenses. A sensitivity analyses is not done due to the following

assumptions and instruments:

- Non-derivative fixed-income financial instruments are only subject to balance sheet interest rate risk

if they are measured at fair value. Mangrove Group measures such financial instruments at amortized

cost.

- Non-derivative variable rate financial instruments whose interest payments are not included as

hedged items in an economical hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow hedge are subject

to interest rate risk both in the income statement and in cash flow (cash flow interest rate risk and

interest rate risk recognized in profit or loss). The issued fixed rate senior secured bond is the only

material financial instrument. Thus, no interest rase rate sensitive analysis is applicable.

- Embedded derivatives that were separated from the bonds do not include material interest rate risk

due to a change in fair value which derives from various early redemption options.

- Currency derivatives are not subject to material interest rate risk and therefore have no effect on

interest rate sensitivity.

**Capital management**

Mangrove Group’s capital management covers both equity and liabilities. An objective is to maintain

sufficient and equal levels of working capital, current assets, and current liabilities. Due to the broad product

range and the activities on global markets, under normal economic conditions Mangrove Group generates

predictable and sustainable cash flows.

Resources are allocated within the Mangrove Group primarily on the basis of strategic and medium-term
planning. This provides the framework for preparing key decisions on core technologies, sales markets,
and other strategically important variables.


-----

Acquisitions and expansion investments are assessed not only on the basis of key performance indicators

showing potential returns, but also in terms of their importance for achieving the Group’s strategic goals.

The key economic criterion for evaluating rationalization and expansion investments is the net present value

of future cash flows associated with these investments. The payback period (i.e., the time until the initial

cash out from the investment has been recovered) is also calculated as an additional benchmark for

assessing the risk arising from changing economic conditions.

Working capital is another key element of capital employed. Working capital management begins before an

order is accepted with the payment terms that are offered or negotiated.

The capital structure is monitored with various key financial indicators of which the total net leverage ratio

is one of the key financial indicators. The ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the

RCF, is an important financial ratio (debt ratio) used in the Mangrove Group, especially for the covenants

calculations, as described in above sections of this report.

(EUR thousand) **12/31/2023** **12/31/2022**

Financial Liabilities (as defined in the financial covenants) -391,434 -453,386

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA LTM -146,262 -90,630

**Total Net Leverage Ratio** 1.58 **3.81**

**Legal risks associated with the acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group**

The acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group was consummated in connection with the balance-sheet

restructuring transaction of the former Galapagos Group on October 9, 2019 (the “Restructuring”). A

number of claims have been brought arising out of the Restructuring. More information on legal risks is

included in Note “8.3 Litigation”.

### 4. Consolidated statement of financial position disclosures: Assets

##### 4.1 Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired

in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the end of the fiscal year and

whenever there is any indication of a potential impairment. The units to which the goodwill is allocated

represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent of

cash flows from other (groups of) assets and the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is

monitored for internal management purposes.

In the Mangrove Group, the 4 CGU-segments are coming from four business units Refrigeration

Technologies, Machine Cooling Systems, Kelvion Thermal Solutions and Plate Heat Exchangers.

The goodwill arose from the acquisition of the Galapagos BidCo Group on October 9, 2019. Goodwill

primarily derives from future growth that is expected with new customers and new technological

developments. No goodwill was allocated to the former cash-generating unit ENEXIO, as the economic

situation does not justify a goodwill.

The following table shows the allocation of goodwill to the cash-generating units of the Mangrove Group:

**Kelvion** **Total**


**Kelvion**
**Thermal**
**Solutions**


**Refrigeration**
(EUR thousand)
**Technologies**


**Machine**

**Cooling**
**Systems**


**Plate Heat**
**Exchangers**


**Goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2022** 32,746 40,630 18,140 33,758 **125,275**

**Goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2023** 32,746 40,630 18,140 33,758 **125,275**

The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit of the Group as of December 31, 2023 is determined

by calculating an individual value in use by applying the discounted cash flow method taking into account

existing business developments as well as long-term expectations. The business plan consists of a detailed

planning for the year 2024 as well as a strategic planning for the years 2025 and 2026. This detailed planning

has been expanded by two years, of which the year 2027 is a transitional period and the year 2028 is used

as terminal value.

The business plan for the Mangrove Group is based on CGU-specific assumptions about the trend in key

macroeconomic parameters such as gross domestic product, market share, trends in labor costs, as well as

trends in the cost of raw materials and regulatory framework conditions. Based on this, plan key figures are

developed for each CGU for the three-year planning period, which are used to derive at net cash flows to

complete the planning process prepared by segment's key management and discussed in shareholder

committees.

In the base case scenario of the business plan no impairment incurred as shown in the table below:

**Kelvion** **Total**


**Refrigeration**
(EUR thousand)
**Technologies**


**Machine Cooling**

**Systems**


**Kelvion Thermal**

**Solutions**


**Plate Heat**
**Exchangers**


**Recoverable amount as of Dec. 31,**
250.290 191.396 296.879 163.819 **902.384**
**2023**

**Carrying amount as of Dec. 31, 2023** 67.893 88.395 39.266 144.873 **340.427**

**Headroom as of Dec. 31, 2023** 182.397 103.001 257.613 18.945 **561.956**


-----

Although the estimation of the discounted future cash flows is believed to be appropriate, changes in

assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis. The goodwill impairment test as of

December 31, 2023 leads to no impairment, as the recoverable amounts of the segments are higher than

the carrying amount of the respective segment assets.

The net cash inflows are discounted at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt

capital. To account for the different risk and return profiles of the Mangrove Group’s principal businesses,

the after-tax cost of capital is calculated separately for each unit and a specific capital structure is defined

by benchmarking against comparable companies in the same industry sector. The cost of equity corresponds

to the return expected by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the conditions on which

comparable companies can obtain long-term financing. Both components are derived from capital market

information.

The value in use is based on the following key assumptions: For the period beyond the detailed planning

horizon, cash flows are based on an extrapolation using a growth rate of 1.00 percent (FY 2022: 1.50

percent). This underlying growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth for the markets in

which the segments operate. The CGU-specific total cost of capital assumed for discounting is based on a

risk-free long-term interest rate of 2.75 percent and a market risk premium of 6.68 percent. Additionally,

beta factors, a borrowing risk premium as well as capital structures were derived from a peer group for each

cash-generating unit. Also, unit-specific tax rates were applied.

The following table presents the applied sustainable growth rate and the cost of capital factors used to

discount the expected cash flows:

**Overview sustainable growth rate and cost of capital** **Sustainable** **Weighted average**

**Growth Rate** **cost of capital**

**2023** **2023**

Refrigeration Technologies 1.00 % 9,91%

Machine Cooling Systems 1.00 % 10,35%

Kelvion Thermal Solutions 1.00 % 10,90%

Plate Heat Exchangers 1.00 % 10,99%

The Group carried out sensitivity analysis in line with IAS 36. The resulting recoverable amounts by varying

Provisions for guarantees and warranties relate to warranty commitments for products and equipment, as

it is customary in the industry. The guarantees and warranties on which they are based are granted in

connection with certain performance criteria relating to products or equipment. Warranties usually have a

contractual term of between one and two years from the date on which the products or equipment are

accepted. In addition to warranties explicitly agreed under contract, product liability rules apply in many

countries and may also stipulate that the manufacturer is liable beyond the contractually defined term of

the warranty. In some cases, recourse claims exist in the form of insurance refunds or subcontractor

guarantees. The level of provisions is based on management’s best estimate.

**Litigation risks**

Provisions are recognized for risks arising from expected or pending litigation against Mangrove Group

companies if it is believed that there is likely to be an unfavorable outcome to the proceedings. Assessments

by counsel for the company or legal experts were used to determine the likelihood of such litigation. The

probable damages or sanctions have been recognized as a provision.

**Construction related provisions**

This item comprises the cost of residual work that is incurred after a contract has already been invoiced and

the profit from the contract has been recognized. The amount of the expected cost is stated.

**Sundry other provisions**

Other provisions mainly comprise the following items: Anticipated losses on pending transactions (EUR

5.996 thousand), purchase price allocation related to contingent liabilities (EUR 1,236 thousand) as well as

remaining other provisions (EUR 9.358 thousand).

##### 5.4.1 Defined benefit pension plans

Mangrove Group employees are offered various benefit options mainly in the form of defined benefit and

defined contribution pension plans. The defined benefit pension plan obligations mainly exist in Germany.

Mangrove Group grants old-age, disability, and survivors’ benefits to many of its employees. New

employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions.

As part of the general benefits provided all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their

compensation. Under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of

up to 100 percent of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit. A corresponding collective

bargaining agreement was entered by the predecessors of the Group in 2002 and revised in 2008. The new

pension plan beginning in January 2019 does not only provide for pension payments, but also capital

payments and installment payments.

The post-retirement benefits are adjusted by minimum of 1 percent each year, according to the

occupational retirement act (§ 16 Betriebsrentengesetz). In 2023 post-retirement benefits are adjusted by

2.1 percent.

In addition to the currently open benefit schemes, there are a number of historical pension schemes in the

company. These schemes are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for

employees who were members at the time the scheme was closed.

The pension liabilities are partly covered by reinsurance policies.

All liabilities were actuarially valued as of December 31, 2023.

Mangrove Group views granting pension benefits as an opportunity to foster employee loyalty and

engagement. It is therefore an integral part of the remuneration concept and has an appropriate employee

contribution component. In connection with this, Mangrove Group observes developments on the human

resources market and regularly checks that the benefits it grants are appropriate and in line with the market.

Mangrove Group does not believe that the pension liabilities pose any risks over and above the customary

extent and the general risks described above.

Pensioners 4,343 3,914

**Total** **25,351** **23,439**

**Plan assets**

On the relevant reporting date, the plan assets to cover the pension obligations amount to 0.

**Actuarial assumptions**

As of the relevant reporting date, the following weighted actuarial assumptions were used to calculate the

present value of the defined benefit obligation relating to pension plans. These assumptions are used to

calculate the net pension expenses in the following year:

(Percent) **12/31/2023** **12/31/2022**

Discount factor 3.0 4.0

Inflation 2.0 2.0

derived: wage and salary increase rate 3.0 3.0

derived: pension increase rate 2.0 2.0

The actuarial measurement factors for German pension plans are established by Mangrove Group in

consultation with actuarial experts. The corresponding assumptions for the few pension plans outside

Germany are determined taking into account country-specific conditions. The discount rate is established

using a recognized method based on the return on high quality corporate bonds determined as of the

reporting date, taking into account the currency and maturities of the underlying liabilities.

All other assumptions correspond to the long-term expectations of Mangrove Group. The nominal rate of

wage and salary increases is calculated based on expected inflation and a real rate of increase. The rate of

pension increases in Germany is also determined based on inflation, provided that the pension adjustments

are determined in accordance with the rise in the cost of living. If a firm pension adjustment commitment

has been made, this is taken into account accordingly.

On 4 October 2018, Heubeck AG published new mortality tables (Heubeck mortality tables 2018G), for the

valuation of all German plans as at 31 December 2023, these tables are used. On this basis, the life

expectancy of a 65-year-old pensioner as of the reporting date is 21.63 years for men and 24.97 years for

women.

The sensitivities presented below were applied to the discount rate and inflation, which have been identified

as actuarial assumptions that have a significant influence on Mangrove Group’s benefit obligations. Since

the wage and salary increase rate and the pension increase rate are derived from inflation, sensitivity to

inflation was used to measure the sensitivity of these assumptions together. The same calculation methods

were used for sensitivities as for the recognized provisions. The ranges used to compute the sensitivities of

the assumptions are based on the changes that are deemed possible until the next reporting date, given

historical experience. The meaningfulness of historical experience for forecasts of future outcomes and

neglecting to update a number of assumptions simultaneously may represent limitations of these methods.

An increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate decreases the present value of the defined benefit

obligation by 6.12 percent. If the assumed inflation rate declines by 25 basis points, the present value of the

defined benefit obligation decreases by 0.18 percent.

**Future cash flows**

The following benefit payments are expected to be made under the pension plans in the coming years:

Duration 14.0 15.0

##### 5.4.2 Defined contribution pension plans

Various companies operate defined contribution pension plans. Under these plans, the obligation does not

lie with Mangrove Group, but with the respective pension funds. Contributions totaling EUR 6.906 thousand

(2022: EUR 2,627 thousand) were paid in the fiscal year 2023. Contributions of EUR 14.229 thousand (2022:

EUR 11,828 thousand) were paid to state pension insurance schemes. These contributions are recognized

as personnel expenses at the same time as the relevant service is rendered.

##### 5.4.3 Redundancy plan and severance payments

On, August 8, 2023, the French authority approved the social plan to close the production of Kelvion SAS in

Wingles, France. The production has been closed by end of December, most of the severance payments will

be made in the first half of 2024. Severance payments of EUR 8.4 thousand for recognized in Kelvion SAS at

the 31 December 2023. Additionally, some capacity reduction has been announced in Germany in Q4, and

respective severance provision is recognized within EUR 8.3 thousand at the 31 December 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, the position Senior Secured Notes (SSNs) includes an Agio of EUR 14.434 thousand

(2022: EUR 22.273 thousand). The purchase price allocation recognized a contingent liability relating to the

SSNs which amounts to EUR 17.787 thousand (2022: EUR 26.412 thousand) as of December 31, 2023. The

agio and the contingent liability is amortized by using the effective interest rate method and recorded as an

additional interest expense in the interest result. Debt discount is being amortized in interest result using

the effective interest rate method. Accrued interests have been recognized as other current financial

liabilities.

**General remarks**

On October 9, 2019, the Company has issued EUR 356.233,492 thousand in aggregate principal amount of

LuxCo III S.à r.l. as well as the issuer’s subsidiaries that guarantee the notes. Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and

Kelvion Finance GmbH, and GLAS Trustee Limited act as trustee.

**Interest on the notes and right to defer interest payments in cash in 2022 and 2023**

The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.775% per annum and will be payable in cash, semi-annually in arrears

on June 15 and December 15 of each year; provided that with respect to the interest periods ending June

15, 2022, December 15, 2022, June 15, 2023 and/or December 15, 2023, the Company, in its sole discretion,

elect (if such election is necessary to ensure compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant and clean

-----

down provision as per the terms of the New RCF on the relevant interest payment date and the twelve

months following thereafter) to capitalize part of its interest payments for those periods, with the remainder

payable in cash (an “Interest Election”).

Following an Interest Election, interest due for the relevant interest period will be equal to an aggregate

amount of 9.00% and shall comprise the following elements: (i) 0.25% per annum cash-pay interest; and (ii)

8.75% per annum payment-in-kind interest (increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Notes or by

issuing additional New Notes, in each case, in a principal amount equal to an amount corresponding to an

interest rate of 8.75% per annum on 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes).

**Right to redeem the notes**

Since October 09, 2023, the second anniversary of the Restructuring Effective Time, the Company is entitled,

at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price as described in the Notes

certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes.

**Mandatory repayment upon request in case of change of control**

Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes will have the right

to require the Company to repurchase such holders’ Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate

principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption.

Following certain public equity offerings by the Parent or any Parent Entity (as defined in the Notes

Indenture), the Company will be required to use the net cash proceeds of the relevant public equity offering

to make an offer to redeem the Notes at the redemption prices described in the Notes Indenture.

**Pledge agreements – securitization of the Notes**

In accordance with the notes indenture, various pledge agreements between the banks and selected Group

##### 5.10 Financial instruments

The following tables provide an overview of the composition of financial instruments as of

December 31, 2023 by class within the meaning of IFRS 7 as well as by measurement category.

Trade receivables´ measurement in accordance with IFRS 15 (Trade receivables) include primarily

capitalized contract costs, PoC-gross profit earned to date and less progress billings. Other financial assets

measured in accordance with other IFRS consist mainly of VAT tax receivables, other receivables from

tax authorities and prepaid expenses to third party.

The following financial instruments fall under the amortized cost category as these are “hold” to collect

contractual cash flows: trade receivables (not tendered), cash, other financial assets (e.g., other operating

receivables). Other financial investments are both held-to-collect and for sale. The remeasurement of the

investments has not revealed any significant changes to the book value. Financial investments designated

as fair value through profit and loss are managed assets on a fair value basis and the business model is

neither held-to-collect nor held-to-collect and for sale. Collection of contractual cash flows is incidental to

the objective of this model. This category includes mainly derivatives and embedded derivatives.

Financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, or for which a fair value is disclosed in the

notes to the consolidated financial statements, are required to be categorized according to the fair value

hierarchy described in the following.

Categorization within the levels of the fair value hierarchy is based on the measurement of the underlying

inputs:

Level 1 inputs: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial assets and liabilities.

Level 2 inputs: quoted market prices that are observable as direct (prices) or indirect (derived from prices)

inputs used to measure fair value and that are not quoted prices as defined by Level 1.

Level 3 inputs: inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The following table shows the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities into the three-level

fair value hierarchy.

Trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and liabilities have short remaining

maturities in general. As a result, their fair values correspond to the carrying amounts.

Regarding Tracking preferred equity certificates / shareholder loan we refer to note “5.2 Tracking preferred

equity certificates / shareholder loan”.

The carrying amount of the trade payables and other current liabilities that are subject to the measurement

rules of IFRS 9 corresponds to their fair value. The fair value of fixed-interest liabilities is the present value

of their expected future cash flows. They are discounted at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. The

carrying amount of variable-rate liabilities corresponds to their fair value.

The fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives are calculated using quoted exchange rates and yield

curves observable in the market. Accordingly, they are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of senior secured notes is categorized within Level 1. Fair Value is calculated according to its

quoted (unadjusted) price in active market.

The fair value of other financial assets of shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other equity

investments is measured on the basis of available financial information, such as transaction prices for

financing rounds or business plans to the extent that this information is reliable, or, as an approximation, as

cost, which is considered an appropriate estimate of fair value as no more suitable information is available.

A review is carried out on a quarterly basis using all information available on the equity investments to

establish whether cost is still representative of fair value. This would not be the case, for example, in the

event of a significant change in the market in which the equity investments are active. As cost is the sole

input factor for fair value, a percentage change in cost results in an equal change in fair value. The estimated

fair value would increase (decrease) with any increase (decrease) in cost. A 1% increase (decrease) would

not materially affect fair value. Accordingly, they are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The fair value of currency forwards at the reporting date is calculated on the basis of the spot exchange rate,

taking into account forward premiums and discounts corresponding to the relevant remaining maturities.

Forward premiums and discounts are derived from yield curves observable at the reporting date. The fair

value of currency options is calculated on the basis of recognized measurement models. Fair value is affected

by the remaining term of the option, the current exchange rate, the volatility of the exchange rate, and the

underlying yield curves.

Mangrove Group uses currency forwards as derivative financial instruments to hedge economically foreign

currency risk for existing or planned underlying transactions.

The carrying amounts for the derivatives presented in the balance sheet are gross amounts.

Mangrove Group enters into derivative transactions under netting agreements with banks under the

German Master Agreement for Financial Derivatives Transactions. In general, under such agreements, the

amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same

currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other, in certain

circumstances – e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs - all outstanding transactions under the

agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in

settlement of all transactions. The potential offsetting volume is insignificant.

**Income and expenses**

The measurement effects from financial instruments have been recognized in profit or loss. The following

The amount of deferred tax expense (income) relating to the origination and reversal of temporary

differences amounting to EUR 17 946 thousand (2022: EUR 22,787 thousand).

In 2023, EUR 13 thousand deferred tax expense (2022: EUR 2,883 thousand deferred tax income) have been

recognized directly in other comprehensive income (OCI). The deferred taxes from OCI relate mostly to

pensions. In addition, there is tax income from FX effects in the amount of EUR 1,292 thousand in 2023.

A netted amount of EUR -7,911 thousand (EUR -15,577 thousand on NOL, EUR 7,666 thousand on other

connection with shares in subsidiaries in the amount of EUR 23,114 thousand because the company can
control their reversal and no reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.

A positive business development is assumed in the future, so that the tax assets recognized as of December

31, 2023 are realizable using the estimated future taxable income

A company in France suffered tax losses in 2022 (EUR 4,426 thousand) and in 2023 (EUR 5,354 thousand),

this entity closed their production in Q4 2023. Following the successful restructuring the entity expect

positive results within the upcoming five years based on changed business model. Therewith on a planned

taxable income for the upcoming five years of EUR 3,000 thousand a deferred tax assets of EUR 763

thousand has been recognized.

One affiliated company in the United States suffered a tax loss in 2022 for corporate income tax (EUR 3,421

thousand) and local taxes (EUR 724 thousand) which were fully utilised in 2023. Based on the strong result

in 2023 and the planned positive income for the upcoming years the company management is convinced

that the deferred tax asset on temporary differences of EUR 5,873 thousand can be realized.

The amount and the expiry period of corporate income tax losses (without discontinued operations) are

illustrated as follows:

(EUR thousand) **2023** **2022**

Within one year 5,598 10,912

Within two years 4,366 8,472

Within three years 6,576 4,751

Within four years 11,279 3,833

Within five years or later  - 1,228

Indefinite carryforward 699,169 650,922

**Total tax losses carried forward** **726,988** **680,118**

As of December 31, 2023, no deferred tax assets were recognized for corporate income tax loss

carryforwards in the amount of EUR 698,541 thousand (2022: EUR 629,813 thousand), thereof interest

carryforward in the amount of EUR 219,030 thousand (2022: EUR 152,954 thousand), as their utilization is

not sufficiently certain.

As of December 31, 2023, no deferred assets were recognized on deductible temporary differences in the
amount of 16,888 thousand Euro (2022: 51,777 thousand Euro).

**Global minimum top-up tax**

The group is in the process of enacting new legislation to implementation the global minimum top-up tax,

expectedly from fiscal year 2024 onwards and is in the process of adopting the necessary internal measures

to fully comply with upcoming legislation.

To measure the impact, if the global minimum tax legislation had applied in 2023 already, the group tested

the Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour rules provided by said upcoming legislation, based on financial and tax

data for the year 2022. Based on this, all jurisdictions where the group operates, would have been covered

and deemed to have a zero top-up tax and thus no subsidiary in these jurisdictions would have been subject

to the full global minimum tax legislation.

Since the newly enacted legislation in Luxembourg is only effective from 1 January 2024, there is no current

tax impact for the year ended 31 December 2023. The group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from

deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is

incurred.

**Contingent liability for income taxes**

A transfer pricing audit was carried out at an Indian subsidiary for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021
financial years by the Indian tax authorities and results in a contingent liability.

The uncertain tax treatment relates to the interpretation of how the tax legislation is to be applied to
the transfer prices for the company. The company has already started an appeal process against the
assessment notes for transfer pricing which is still pending.

No tax amounts were accrued for this topic since the company is convinced to get a relief for most of
the findings in the appeal processes and because of the huge amount of loss carry-forwards of this
entity (no deferred taxes were recognized on the tax loss-carry-forward amounts). The impact of the
transfer pricing adjustment in the amount of EUR 2,750 thousand would reduce the tax-loss-carryforward correspondingly.

### 7. Lease

A lease is an agreement that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a defined period

of time in return for a number of payments. The Group is a lessee mainly of land and buildings, machinery,

transportation and technical equipment.

**Lease accounting since October 9, 2019**

With the adoption of IFRS 16, the lessee is no longer required to differentiate between operating and finance

leases. As lessee, Mangrove now accounts for nearly all leases, recognising right-of-use assets for leased

assets and liabilities for lease agreements. The following principles are considered:

    - Mangrove exercises the exemption for lease agreements with a maximum term of 12 months

from the date of provision and low-value assets. Low-value assets are generally defined as leased

with aggregated payments of EUR 20,000 or less.

    - Mangrove separates non-lease components, such as services, from lease payments.

    - Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments. Lease

payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readily be determined.

Otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate,

which is mainly applied, is based on risk-adjusted interest rates, and determined for the

respective lease terms and currencies.

    - A right-of-use asset is initially recognised at the same amount as the lease liability. Differences

may arise from lease payments before commencement date and initial direct costs.

    - After capitalisation at commencement date, the right-of use asset is measured at cost and

depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method.

    - Extension and termination options are part of a number of leases particularly of real estate.

Extension and termination options are taken into account on recognition of the lease liability only

if it is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future. When contract terms

are being determined, consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that offer an

economic incentive for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options.

Changes in lease terms arising from the exercise of an extension option or non-exercise of a

termination option are only considered when determining lease terms if sufficient certainty

exists. Estimates and expectations which are asserted at the commencement date of the lease

liability and the right-of-use asset and pertain to future payments not yet determined on the date

of provision are assessed continuously during the lease term. If subsequently improved or

changed knowledge influences the expected payment profile over time, the lease liability is

remeasured.

The following right-of-use assets are recognised under other intangible assets:

**Carrying** **Carrying**

(EUR thousand) **amount Dec.** **Exchange** **amount Dec.**

**31, 2022** **Addition** **Disposal** **Amortization** **differences** **31, 2023**

Land and buildings 57,214 13,410 -5,006 -11,612 -357 53,649
Technical equipment and
2,389 2,703 -798 -561 102 3,834
machinery

Other equipment, operating
3,432 2,722 -1,552 -616 15 4,000
and office equipment

**Group Total** **63,035** **18,835** **-7,357** **-12,789** **-241** **61,484**

The corresponding lease liabilities are explained under financial liabilities (see note 5.7).

The maturities of the outstanding lease payments comprised the following items:


-----

**Maturities of future minimum lease payments**


(EUR thousand) **12/31/2023** **12/31/2022**

Not later than one year 13,812 13,852

Between one and five years 32,190 34,102

More than five years 20,443 35,206

**Group Total** **66,445** **83,160**

In addition, the following amounts were recognised in the income statement in 2023 in connection with

lease contracts in which Mangrove was the lessee:


**Income Statement Impact of Leases**


(EUR thousand) **2023** **2022**

Interest expenses for lease liabilities 3,357 3,246

Income from sublease agreement -92 -61

Expenses for short-term leases with terms longer than one month and up to 12 months 1,264 1,136

Expenses low-value asset leases (excluding short-term leases) 56 121

**Group Total** **4,585** **4,442**

Cash outflows related to lessee activities in 2023 amounted to: EUR 17,664 thousand (2022: EUR 16,352
thousand).

Potential future cash outflows of EUR 2,402 million for renewal or termination options that are not
sufficiently certain were not included in the liability as of December 31, 2023 because it’s not reasonably
certain that the leases will be renewed or not terminated.

### 8. Contingent liabilities, other financial obligations and litigation

##### 8.1 Contingent liabilities

A Contingent liability is according to IAS 37.10 a “possible obligation that arises from past events and

whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain

future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or a present obligation that arises from past

events but is not recognized because:

(i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle

the obligation; or

(ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.”, i.e., uncertainties for

which the outcome has not been determined. If the occurrence is probable and the outcome can be

estimated reliable, a liability is recorded in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, Mangrove

Group has a recognized contingent liability relating to the SSNs which amounts to EUR 17,787 thousand

(2022: EUR 26,412 thousand) as of December 31, 2023. This contingent liability was recognized via

purchase price allocation.

Several companies of Mangrove Group have issued or instructed the issuance of bank guarantees in favor

of customers or lenders. These bank guarantees are not considered to be contingent liabilities because these

guarantees are linked to a performance obligation to be rendered by Mangrove Group.

##### 8.2 Other financial obligations

Other financial obligations as of December 31, 2023 related to purchase commitments and bank guarantees.

**Purchase commitments**

Purchase commitments as of December 31, 2023 can be broken down as follows:


**Purchase commitments**


(EUR thousand) **12/31/2023** **12/31/2022**

Inventories 176,588 129,717

Intangible assets 64 1,984

Tangible assets 5,643 3,661

**Group Total** **182,296** **135,362**

**Bank Guarantees**

Mangrove Holding Group companies utilized bank guarantees in the amount of EUR 141,4 million (as of

December 31, 2022: EUR 157,7 million). A major part of the lines is granted by a bank consortium (total line

EUR 190 million, thereof EUR 124,9 million utilized).

The obligation presented in the following table relates to contingent liabilities for which primary debtors in

the underlying transactions (e.g., deliveries) are non-consolidated Mangrove Group companies, and for

which bank guarantees were utilized in favor of customers.

##### 8.3 Litigation

A number of claims have been brought arising out of the financial restructuring as described below (the

“Restructuring”).

On October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. acquired the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. as described

elsewhere in these notes (e.g. chapter “1.2 Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries and

successful Refinancing on October 9, 2019”), associated preferred equity certificates and any intercompany

payables owed by Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to its former parent company Galapagos S.A. The acquisition was

made in connection with the Restructuring, which was completed on October 9, 2019.

A number of sets of internationally recognized advisors were involved in the Restructuring and latest

decisions show that the Restructuring was fully legally effective and complied with all obligations, including

under the applicable finance documents.

The following claims have been brought which arise out of the Restructuring:

   - Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. had commenced proceedings in England against inter alios the Security

Trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement which effected the Restructuring, the trustee which

held rights on behalf of the Galapagos Senior Notes and each of the plaintiffs in the New York,

German and Luxembourg proceedings described below, requesting that the English Court makes

a series of declarations inter alia that the Restructuring complied with the terms of the

Intercreditor Agreement. The English proceedings do not contain any claim for damages. On 28

July 2023 the English Court issued its judgment, ruling in favour of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., by

confirming that the Restructuring complied with the Intercreditor Agreement. The decision is

legally binding. This is closed now.

   - A claim in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a beneficial holder of the Galapagos
Senior Notes (“NY Claimant”) against inter alios Galapagos Holding (former indirect parent of
Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) and certain of its subsidiaries (now being subsidiaries of Mangrove
Group) relating to the Restructuring. The plaintiff alleged that the Restructuring wrongly deprived
it of value by diverting assets away from the Group and releasing certain guarantees. The plaintiff
ssought: (i) damages; and (ii) a reversal of the steps taken to affect the Restructuring. In addition,
the plaintiff sought a declaration that the release of liabilities under the Galapagos Senior Notes
Indenture pursuant to the provisions of the former Intercreditor Agreement applying to certain
liabilities of the Group was invalid (in other words, that this part of the Restructuring also be
reversed). The Supreme Court of the State of New York decided on 22 July 2020 to stay this action
pending a decision from the English Court as to its jurisdiction in these matters (as referred to
above). Following the decision of the English Court on 28 July 2023, the NY Claimant agreed to a
joint stipulation regarding the dismissal of its claim with prejudice, i.e., the dismissal is legally
binding on all parties. This is closed now.

   - On October 31, 2019 main insolvency proceedings were opened over the assets of Galapagos
S.A. in Düsseldorf, Germany. Two appeals were lodged at the German Federal Supreme Court on


-----

the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf insolvency court. Following such appeals, on December 17,
2020, the German Federal Court of Justice referred certain legal questions concerning matters of
European insolvency law (and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf court in such
insolvency proceedings) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for determination. The
Court of Justice of the European Union rendered its decision on 24 March 2022, which confirmed
that the German courts did not have authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019,
given that the European regime applied to the UK at this time. Following this decision, on 30 June
2022 the English insolvency court made a winding-up order with regard to Galapagos S.A. and
has therefore asserted its jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings (after it had stayed the
insolvency proceedings in England in August 2019 due to the court in Düsseldorf, Germany,
claiming its jurisdiction). The German Federal Court of Justice rendered its decision (based on the
Court of Justice of the European Union decision) on 8 December 2022, declaring that since the
English courts did not make their winding-up order prior to the Brexit transition period, i.e. 31
December 2020 such that the German courts are no longer bound by the EU Insolvency
regulation when considering proceedings opened in England, the German courts had
retrospective authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019. Thus, the German
insolvency proceedings remain in place, alongside the competing equivalent English proceedings.

   - The purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., Luxembourg (former 100 percent shareholder of
Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) has brought a claim against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos
BidCo S.à r.l. in Luxembourg detailing his allegations that the Restructuring (i.e. the refinancing
of Galapagos Group and the sale of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove Group) involved a
fraudulent exercise of a Luxembourg share pledge and that it should, therefore, be unwound.
However, no steps have been taken by the administrator to progress this claw back action. In
addition, the administrator has brought a separate action challenging the 2021 restructuring of
the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This action raises similar allegations to those made in the
claw back action. The Luxembourg Court has yet to order a timetable for Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à
r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l’ to file their defence.
The purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., had initiated a claw back action against inter
alios Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l.  This proceeding was dismissed by the District Court of Düsseldorf
on 15 June 2023. The dismissal is legally binding. This is closed now.

Based on legal advice of leading international law firms based in the UK, Luxembourg, Germany and the US

(privilege in respect of which is not waived) and based on the final decisions of the courts in England, New

York and Germany, Management assesses the risk from the above-mentioned ongoing litigation as well as

future litigation as follows: 1) The risk that the Restructuring would be unwound is considered remote; and

2) The risk of having to pay damages to former holders of the Galapagos Senior Notes or any other third

party is considered unlikely. Please also refer to the chapter “11. Events after the end of the reporting

period”.

### 9. Other disclosures

##### 9.1 Consolidated cash flow statement disclosures from

 continuing operations

**Cash flow from operating activities – continuing operations – increased from EUR 80.2 million in 2022 to**

EUR 217.8 million in fiscal year 2023. This cash-flow is driven by an EBITDA of EUR 120.5 million and a EUR

67.9 million lower trade working capital. These positive impacts are partially offset by tax payments of EUR

9.7 million.

**Cash flow from investing activities – continuing operations – decreased from EUR -33.5 million in 2022 to**

EUR -46.2 million in 2023 which shows high investment activity in 2023. The cash out in 2023 relates to the

acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as to intangible assets of EUR -56.6 million. The

proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets and assets held for sale amount to EUR 10.5 million.

**Cash flow from financing activities – continuing operations – decreased from EUR -6.4 million in 2022 to**

EUR -114,648 million. In the current year, the financing cash flow primarily consists of interest payments

(EUR -40.5 million, FY 2022: EUR -41,7 million), and repayment of the revolving credit facility by EUR 65.0

million, (FY 2022: EUR 50.0 million proceeds).

**Total** **3,846** **2,567**

The remuneration of former members of the key operating management amounts to EUR 0 thousand (2023:

EUR 0 thousand).

For more details regarding the share-based payments we refer to note “9.5 Share based payments”

##### 9.5 Share based payments

In 2020 certain management personnel (“co-investors”) were invited to participate in the Mangrove Group’s
Management Incentive Plan (“Mangrove MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of
Mangrove Management Invest S.C.A; an entity which has a part-ownership of Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l., the
parent company of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l.. In order to participate in the MIP, an initial cash investment
was required from the co-investors, which was at not less than the fair value of the investments.

During the year 2022 an additional Management Incentive Plan was launched. Again, certain management
personnel were invited to participate in the new Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group’s Management Incentive
Plan (“KTS MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of TESCO Management S.C.A; an entity
which has a minority of TES LuxCo S.à r.l.. TES LuxCo S.à r.l. is the parent company of the Mangrove´s business
unit Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group. Similar to the first MIP (“Mangrove MIP”) launched in 2020, the
investment is structured in a way that the co-investors are taking a part ownership of a holding company via
an investment vehicle. In order to participate in the KTS MIP, in a first step the co-investors sold their
contribution in the Mangrove MIP at fair value to Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.. In the amount of this receivable
from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l., the co-investors received an investment in the new KTS MIP. The initial cash
related investment of the co-investors (receivable from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.) in KTS MIP was not less
than to the fair value of the investment in any case.

The nature of both schemes is such that co-investors’ investments will only be realised upon “exit” of the
Group’s current shareholders, with exception of specific events (for example co-investors leaving the
employment of the Group). It is anticipated that co-investors will participate in the MIPs until such exit is
achieved. The lead investor is permitted to issue further equity, and each co-investor has the explicit right
to participate further in the MIPs, such that their investment is not diluted.

In the context of IFRS 2, both MIPs are considered to be equity-settled share-based payment arrangements.

##### 9.6 Company bodies

The board members of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. are:

Matthew Crill

Joakim Lindström-Formicola

##### 9.7 Shareholder committees

The members of Kelvion's shareholder committee are:

-----

  - Claus von Hermann

##### 9.10 Correction of errors[1]

During 2023 Mangrove Group discovered that Deferred tax liability related to Agio from SSNs was
underestimated at December 31, 2021, and at December 31, 2022, with amount EUR 11,574 thousand.

On October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo III raised the SSN in the amount of EUR 356,294 thousand on the
capital market, considering a premium of EUR 46,372 thousand. The premium was passed to Mangrove
LuxCo IV via an Intercompany loan, and respected expenses were fully deducted in tax returns. Deferred
taxes on premium were not recognized in the IFRS consolidated financial statements either on the
temporary difference from the SSNs or on the tax loss carryforward.

This error has been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for prior

### 11.Events after the end of the reporting period

The German insolvency administrator of Galapagos S.A., Luxembourg (former 100 percent shareholder of

Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) brought a claim against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. in

Luxembourg alleging that the Restructuring (i.e. the refinancing of Galapagos Group and the sale of

Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove Group) involved a fraudulent exercise of a Luxembourg share pledge

and that it should, therefore, be unwound. In addition, the administrator brought a separate action in

Luxembourg challenging the 2021 restructuring of the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This action raised

similar allegations to those made in the separate claw back action in Germany. The German insolvency

administrator of Galapagos S.A. on January 19, 2024 filed withdrawals (Désistement d’action) in respect of

all Luxembourg proceedings previously initiated.

During Q1 2024, the group extended the Senior Guarantee Facility (SGF) as well as the Revolving Credit

Facility (RCF) to 2025, June 9[th].

###### REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE

 Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

 Opinion

 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

 Basis for opinion

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (the “Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

 Other information

 The Board of Managers is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” thereon.


-----

###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

 In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

 Responsibilities of the Board of Managers for the consolidated financial statements

 The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Managers determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Managers is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

 Responsibilities of the réviseur d’entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

 The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

 As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
 statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
 procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

 — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
 accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Managers.


-----

###### — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managers' use of the going concern basis
 of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
 statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
 entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

 We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

 Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

 The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of

## 1. General information

#### 1.1 Company information

Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l., Luxembourg, hereinafter also referred to as " Mangrove LuxCo III " or the

"company" is a public limited liability company (Société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the

laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office at 2, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540

Luxembourg, and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register (Registre de Commerce

et des Sociétés Luxembourg) with registration number B236258. Sole shareholder of the company is

Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l., Luxembourg, which itself is a direct subsidiary of Galapagos LuxCo I S.à r.l.,

Luxembourg. The Company was incorporated on July 11, 2019. The purpose of the Company is the

acquisition, holding and disposal of interests in Luxembourg and/or foreign companies and undertakings as

well as the administration, development and management of such interests.

#### 1.2 Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries and

 successful Refinancing on October 9, 2019

With an effective date October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., Luxembourg, a 100 percent subsidiary

of Mangrove LuxCo III, bought 100 percent of the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg and all its

subsidiaries (together “Galapagos BidCo Group”). Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg, was 100 percent

shareholder of the shares in Kelvion Finance GmbH, Germany including all of its subsidiaries (together

“Kelvion Group”) and in ENEXIO Management GmbH, Germany including all of its subsidiaries (together

“ENEXIO Group”) at the acquisition date. Before the acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group, the Company

did not have any operational activities.

The Acquisition was consummated in connection with the balance sheet restructuring transaction of the

Galapagos Group, the former shareholder of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., which has resulted in a major

recapitalization of the operating business of the Mangrove LuxCo III, Mangrove LuxCo IV and the newly

acquired subsidiaries (collectively, the “Mangrove Group”), a deleveraging of the Mangrove Group’s balance

sheet and access to new debt facilities and instruments with longer tenors (the “Restructuring”). In

"Mangrove Group" or “the Group”.


-----

#### 1.3 Description of the business

The Mangrove Group is a leading global manufacturer of heat exchangers and other cooling & heating

products. The Group is active in multiple end markets such as Refrigeration, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air

Conditioning), Data Center, Power, Heavy & Light Industry, Chemicals, Oil & Gas, Food & Beverage and

Marine. In those markets, the “new Group” services a broad, diversified and long-standing customer base

in more than 130 countries.

###### 1.3.1 Segment Reporting

Mangrove Group operates through the four Kelvion segments, “Kelvion Refrigeration Technologies” (“RT”),

“Kelvion Machine Cooling Systems” (“MCS”), “Kelvion Plate Heat Exchangers” (“PHE”) and “Kelvion Thermal

Solutions” (“KTS”). The former segment “ENEXIO” continues to be in the process of being wound down.

ENEXIO, manufacturer of power plant and industry cooling systems as well as wastewater treatment

solutions, consisted of three business units: Dry Cooling Systems (DCS), Service Solutions and Water

Technologies (WT). After the strategic decision was taken to exit the DCS business and to either sell or

integrate the Service and Water business into Kelvion Group, one part of the DCS business (DCS Heller) was

successfully sold at the end of 2020 and on October 20, 2021 closing in connection with the share purchase

and transfer agreement for the shares of ENEXIO companies comprising the Service business took place.

Furthermore, on January 3, 2022 the same was executed in connection with the shares of ENEXIO

companies comprising the Water business. On March 23, 2022 the Group signed an asset-/share purchase

agreement for certain parts of the DCS business (DCS Air Cooled Condenser) comprising the stake in an

Indian Joint Venture as well as certain assets (intellectual property in Germany and one production line in

China). After these transactions, only parts of the Dry Cooling business remain with the Group, until the

continuing wind-down of this activity has been completed. The declining importance of the ENEXIO Business

is also reflected in its decreasing volume, which represented in FY 2021 already less than 10 Percent and in

FY 2022 less than 1 Percent in terms of Mangrove Group. Overall, the contribution of the segment ENEXIO

to revenue and normalized EBITDA of the Group is no longer significant for the Group’s earnings position.

###### 1.3.2 The four segments of Mangrove Group

The four segments of Mangrove Group focus on distinct technologies and product portfolios:

- **Kelvion Refrigeration Technologies (RT) focuses on component business for refrigeration applications**

with significant growth potential in the data center industry. RT supplies a wide range of standard and

customized heat exchangers for cooling and removing heat from different types of data centers

(hyperscale, colocation, modular etc.) using both air and liquid cooling methods. The data center market

consists of cooling solutions such as air conditioning, chilling units, economizer systems, liquid cooling

systems, control systems and includes services such as consulting, installation & deployment and

maintenance and support. The heat exchanger solutions are also used in the refrigeration market in cold

chain warehouses, supermarkets, non-residential buildings, and industrial production. Product offering

includes air cooled condensers which reject heat from refrigeration systems and are often sold as part of

a package of equipment with air coolers. RT’s customized air coolers are design-to-order units for

industrial or OEM solutions for food processing and distribution facilities. Product offering includes also

customized radiators and dry coolers which are mainly used for power and industrial applications.

Improving the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment is essential for end

users looking to reduce carbon footprint and operating costs.


-----

- **Kelvion Machine Cooling Systems (MCS) is a leading player in heat exchangers for power and engine**

applications with substantial growth opportunities by leveraging its global installed base. MCS supplies

heat exchangers for power generation, power transmission, large engine applications (marine and off
highway) and green applications like biomass, green hydrogen, or renewable energies. The business is

mostly with OEM, e.g., for large engine manufacturers, but MCS also engages in smaller projects, like solar,

wind or solar photovoltaic. Product offering includes charge air coolers, which cool down combustion-air

coming from the turbocharger before entering the engine. MCS’ shell and tube double safety heat

exchangers assure the secure handling of safety-critical media. Product offering also includes box coolers

which are fitted in the sea chest of small and medium-sized vessels.

- **Kelvion Thermal Solutions (KTS), is Kelvion’s largest segment, focusing on project business for demanding**

applications in the Oil & Gas, Chemicals Industries and, like RT, with significant growth potential in high

tech data center business as well as green tech applications such as hydrogen and Carbon Capture and

Storage (CCS). KTS’ engineering expertise plays a key role in differentiation against competitors. High

degree of geographical diversification with sites in all key region, including Europe, NAFTA, Latin America,

China and MEA. Product offering includes air fin coolers typically used for very large cooling requirements

in different industries, e.g., Oil & Gas and Chemicals, as well as air dryers which are used to remove

humidity from an air stream in various process industries. KTS’ shell & tube heat exchangers are used to

heat, cool, or condense water and other media in different process industries. The focus of the BU has

shifted in the recent years from Oil & Gas and Petrochemicals to high and green tech business. KTS

represents mainly the former segment “Kelvion Thermal Engineered Solutions” (“TES”).

- **Kelvion Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) provides a broad range of plate heat exchangers for a wide variety**

of applications in terms of pressure and temperature demands for a wide range of customer industries,

ranging from HVAC and Refrigeration to Food & Beverages, Chemicals, Power, and Industrials. Product

offering includes fully welded plate heat exchangers which are used to save energy in demanding high

pressure and temperature applications, as well as brazed plate heat exchangers, often used for

environmentally friendly heat pump applications. PHE’s gasketed heat exchangers have the highest

efficiency and flexibility and are used in a variety of industries as well as for heat recovery applications.

In contrast to the project driven segment KTS, the three segments RT, MCS and PHE represent the

component type business of the Group and form together “Kelvion Products” (“KP”). All four segments hold

strong favorable market positions in their respective markets. MCS and PHE are among the TOP 3, RT

amongst the Top 5 and KTS is niche-market leader.

In addition to the above segments there is the fifth Service segment, which is a virtual segment, i.e., Service

is not separated from the four segments but managed globally and centrally across segments.

## 2. Reporting and Accounting principles

#### 2.1 Going-concern basis of accounting

###### Preparation of consolidated financial statements

With effective date December 21, 2022, the Group agreed with the lenders to reset the financial covenants,

to which the budget 2023 offers sufficient headroom. In the first three months of the year 2023 the Group

can report an order intake and a financial performance that exceeds previous year and budget 2023. Based

on the good start to the year, management of the Group expects the financial performance for the full year

to exceed budget. With current market conditions and business performance, the Group does not see any

current risk to complying with future covenant requirements and consequently the management does not

see any risk to the going concern of the Group. Based on actual planning the Group will be at every time and

in the upcoming year in the position to meet all its financial obligations.

Therefore, the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group have been prepared on a going
concern basis.

#### 2.2 Basis of presentation

The presented consolidated financial statements cover the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31,

2022 with the prior period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.

The consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group - which comprise the consolidated statement of

financial position, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive

income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated statement of changes in equity and the notes

to the consolidated financial statements - include Mangrove LuxCo III and its direct and indirect subsidiaries

(hereinafter referred to as “Mangrove Group” or the “Group”). The consolidated financial statements have

been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the

EU. All IFRS standards and interpretations in effect for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2022,

have been applied.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in euro (EUR), the functional currency of the group, and

presented in thousand of euros (EUR thousand) or in millions of euros (EUR million). Due to rounding, figures

presented may result in differences of EUR 1 thousand in certain cases.

To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated

income statement have been aggregated and are explained accordingly in the Notes. Assets and liabilities

are classified into current and non-current items. Current assets are expected to be realized within 12

months after the reporting period and current liabilities are due to be settled within 12 months after the

reporting period. The consolidated income statement is prepared using the cost of sales method.

The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method for cash flows from

operating activities and the direct method for cash flows from investing and financing activities.

The accounting and measurement principles are presented and explained in detail in Note 2.8. The

consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Managers on April 28, 2023.

#### 2.3 First-time adoption of new accounting pronouncements

The Group applied for the first time all standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods


-----

beginning on January 1, 2022. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group is not

significant. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendments that were

issued but are not yet effective.

###### 2.3.1 Accounting regulations applied for the first time in the year 2022

   - **Amendments to IFRS 16 (Effective April 1, 2021)**

IFRS 16 contains regulations regarding the recognition of changes in lease payments (including

rental concessions) by the lessee. In general, the lessee must assess for each lease whether the

lease concessions granted constitute changes to the lease and must remeasure the lease liability

as a result.

In response to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, IFRS 16 Leases was amended on

March 31, 2021 to provide a one-year extension of the practical expedient to assist lessees in

accounting for COVID-19-related lease concessions. The amendments extend the practical

expedient to lease concessions that reduce lease payments originally due on or before June 30,

2022. Previously, only lease concessions that reduce lease payments that are or were due on or

before June 30, 2021, were within the scope of the relief.

   - **Amendments to IAS 37 (Effective January 1, 2022)**

Clarification that the cost of fulfilling a contract includes all directly attributable costs. The cost of

fulfilling the contract includes both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (such as direct

wage and material costs) and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.

In addition, it is clarified that before a provision for an onerous contract is established, an entity

should recognize any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in (previously: dedicated

to) fulfilling the contract.

   - **Amendments to IFRS 3 (Effective January 1, 2022)**

In accordance to the amended framework, references to the framework in various standards,

including IFRS 3, have been adjusted. The rules for accounting for business combinations are not

changed in substance. The amendments are to be applied to business combinations for which the

acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2022. Earlier application is permitted.

   - **Improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 (Effective January 1, 2022)**

The Annual Improvements to IFRS amended the following standards:

`o` In IFRS 1, the option was opened for first-time adopters of IFRS 1.D16 (a) to measure

cumulative translation differences at the amounts recognized by the parent.
`o` The amendment to IFRS 9 clarifies which fees are to be included in the 10 percent test

(IFRS 9.B3.3.6) with regard to the assessment of whether a financial liability is

derecognized. Only fees paid or received between the entity as borrower and the lender

are included.
`o` In IFRS 16, the presentation of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements has been

removed in explanatory example 13 to IFRS 16.
`o` In IAS 41, the prohibition on including tax payments in the fair value measurement is

removed.

   - **Amendments to IAS 16 (Effective January 1, 2022)**

The amendment prohibits entities from deducting the cost of an item of property, plant and


-----

equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and

condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Clarification of the definition of the costs of testing. Revenue and cost that relate to items

produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities must be presented separately.

Disclosure of the line item in the statement of comprehensive item that includes such revenue.

###### 2.3.2 Accounting regulations not applied in advance of their effective date

The following standards and amendments to existing standards of possible relevance to the Group, which

were adopted into EU law (endorsement mechanism) but are not yet mandatory, have not been applied

early:

   - **IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (including Amendments) (Effective January 1, 2023)**

IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 and for the first time sets out standard requirements for the recognition,

measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and

investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Under the IFRS 17 measurement

model, groups of insurance contracts are measured based on the expected value of discounted

cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risks as well as a contractual service

margin that results in the recognition of profit in line with the provision of services.

The amendments add a transition option aimed to improve the usefulness of comparative

information presented on initial application of both IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 and introduce the option

of applying a "classification overlay approach". This option can be applied when IFRS 17 and IFRS

9 are applied simultaneously for the first time and no "restatement" of a financial asset with

regard to the comparative information of IFRS 9 in 2022 is made.

   - **Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

The amendment to IAS 1 requires that only "significant" accounting policies are presented in the

notes. To be material, the accounting policy must be related to significant transactions or other

events and there must be a reason for its presentation. A reason may be, for example, that the

method has been changed, it is an option, the method is complex or highly judgmental, or it has

been developed in accordance with IAS 8.10-11. The amendments to Practice Statement 2

accordingly indicate how the concept of materiality is applied to the disclosure of accounting

policies. Thus, in the future, company-specific disclosures are to be given priority over

standardized disclosures.

   - **Amendments to IAS 8 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

The amendment to IAS 8 clarifies how entities can better distinguish changes in accounting

policies from changes in estimates. For this purpose, it is defined that an accounting estimate

always relates to a measurement uncertainty of a financial figure in the financial statements. In

addition to input parameters, an entity also uses valuation techniques to determine an estimate.

Valuation techniques can be estimation techniques or valuation techniques.


-----

   - **Amendments to IAS 12 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

The amendments address previously existing uncertainties in the accounting for deferred taxes

in connection with leases and disposal or restoration obligations.

The amendments clarify the application of the already existing “initial recognition exemption”

(IAS 12.15) and result in the recognition of deferred taxes, e.g. on leases accounted for by the

lessee and on disposal or restoration obligations. This is therefore an exemption to the "initial

recognition exemption" for narrowly defined cases.

These new standards and amendments to existing standards will be applied by the Group starting in fiscal

2022 or later. No material impacts are expected.

#### 2.4 Accounting pronouncements not yet endorsed by the EU

In previous years, and in fiscal year 2022, the IASB issued the following standards and amendments to

existing standards of relevance to the Group, which still have to be adopted into EU law (endorsement

mechanism) before they become applicable:

   - **Amendments to IAS 1 (Effective January 1, 2023)**

The amendments to IAS 1 concern a limited adjustment to the assessment criteria for classifying

liabilities as current or non-current.

It is clarified that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the entity's rights at the

reporting date to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the end of the

reporting period: If such rights exist, the liability is classified as non-current. The right to defer

settlement of the liability must be substantial. If the entity has to meet certain conditions in order

to exercise such a right, these conditions must be met at the reporting date; otherwise, the

liability is classified as current.

For the classification of a liability, it is irrelevant whether management intends or expects that

the liability will actually be settled within twelve months after the balance sheet date. The only

decisive factor for classification is the right existing at the balance sheet date to defer settlement

of the liability for at least 12 months. This also applies in the event of settlement within the value

recovery period.

   - **Amendments to IFRS 16 (Effective January 1, 2024)**

The Amendments to IFRS 16 shall clarify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and

leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale. It

requires a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in a

way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it

retains. The new requirements do not prevent a seller-lessee from recognising in profit or loss

any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of a lease.

   - **Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28**

The amendments address a known inconsistency between the requirements of IFRS 10 and IAS

28 (2011) in the case of the disposal of assets to an associate or joint venture or the contribution

of assets to an associate or joint venture.


-----

IFRS 10 requires a parent to recognize the full amount of the gain or loss on disposal of a

subsidiary in profit or loss when control is lost. In contrast, the currently applicable IAS 28.28

requires that the gain or loss on disposal of a disposal transaction between an investor and an

investment accounted for using the equity method - whether an associate or a joint venture - be

recognized only to the extent of the other's interest in the entity.

In the future, the entire gain or loss on a transaction is to be recognized only if the assets sold or

contributed constitute a business as defined by IFRS 3. This applies regardless of whether the

transaction is structured as a share or asset deal. If, on the other hand, the assets do not

constitute a business, only pro rata income recognition is permitted.

The IASB has postponed the date of first-time application of the amendments indefinitely.

#### 2.5 Impact of the introduction of a global minimum tax rate by

 the OECD (Pillar Two)

To address concerns about the unequal distribution of profits and unequal tax levies of large multinational

corporations, various agreements have been reached at the global level, including an agreement by over

135 countries to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent. In December 2021, the OECD published

a draft legal framework, followed by detailed guidance in March 2022, to be used by individual countries

that are signatories to the agreement to amend their local tax laws. Once the changes in tax laws are in place

or will soon be in place in the countries where the Group operates, the Group may be subject to the

minimum tax.

At the date of authorization of the consolidated financial statements for issue, the tax legislation related to

the minimum tax is not applicable or soon to be applicable in any of the countries in which the Group

operates. The Board closely monitors the progress of the legislative process in each country in which the

Group operates. As of December 31, 2022, the Group did not have sufficient information to determine the

potential quantitative impact.

#### 2.6 Basis of consolidation

###### Consolidated entities

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Mangrove LuxCo III and its direct

and indirect subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are generally

prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, except of the Indian subsidiary, consistently

applying group IFRS accounting policies. The financial year ends due to local Indian commercial law on March

31, each year. This company was incorporated in the consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group

on the basis of interim financial statements.

All intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group

transactions, are eliminated.

The consolidated financial statements of Mangrove Group include Mangrove LuxCo III and all material

companies which Mangrove LuxCo III controls directly or indirectly. Companies are consolidated as of the

date on which control is obtained by Mangrove LuxCo III. They are deconsolidated as of the date on which

control is lost.

In addition to the ultimate parent company, 55 companies were consolidated.


-----

The scope of consolidation changed as follows:

**Number of companies** **2022** **2021**

**Consolidated Group as of January 1** **55** **61**

Acquisition 4 3

Merger 1 6

Liquidation 1 1

Deconsolidation 2 2

**Consolidated Group as of December 31** **55** **55**

Domestic companies Luxembourg 4 5

Foreign companies 51 50

A list of companies included in the consolidated financial statements and of all companies, in which

Mangrove LuxCo III has interests in, is provided in Note 13.

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control is assumed, when the following three criteria

are fulfilled: (1) the parent company holds decision-making power over the relevant activities of the

investee, (2) the company has rights to variable returns from the investee and (3) the parent company can

use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns. The fulfillment of these criteria is assessed

based on corporate governance and potential supplementary agreements.

Acquisitions include the following companies: ENEXIO ACC GmbH, Kelvion Management GmbH, Thermal

Solutions Germany GmbH and TESCO Management SCA .

The ongoing optimazition of the group structure reduced the number of subsiduaries to a minimum. In 2022,

one consolidated company (Mangrove HoldCo S.à r.l.) was **_liquidated. In addition one consolidated_**

company was merged. The Kelvion Thermal S.A.S. was merged into Kelvion Thermal Soutions S.A.S.

In 2022 the two consolidated companies ENEXIO Water Technologies GmbH and ENEXIO UK Ltd. were sold

and **_deconsolidated. For further details see Note 4. “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued_**

operations”.

Companies that are dormant or do not have significant impact on the financial position and results of

operation of the Group are not included in the consolidated financial statements.

A total of three (prior year: three) companies are not consolidated. The aggregate assets, equity, revenues

and earnings of these companies are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The subsidiaries

are recognised at cost as non-current other financial assets. Management deems the influence to the Group

as absolutely insignificant and hence, the disclosure required under IFRS has not been made due to

materiality reason. The disclosure of this information is not suitable to communicate additional information.

###### Control over subsidiary Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.

As described in more detail in section “9.3 Litigations”, the purported administrator of Galapagos S.A.

(“GSA”), Luxembourg (former 100 percent shareholder of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l., “GBG") brought a claim

in Luxembourg against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. (Mangrove) and GBG. An _ex parte order of the_

Luxembourg Court was granted on November 27, 2019 at the request of the purported administrator of

GSA placing the shares of GBG in escrow and appointing a Luxembourg based law firm as escrow trustee

(the Trustee). The Escrow Order has as its primary purpose the preservation of the GBG shares as an asset,

primarily by preventing an actual or de facto liquidation of GBG, pending separate determination of the

main proceedings brought by GSA (which contest the transfer of the shares in GBG under a Luxembourg


-----

pledge enforcement). This escrow order was successfully appealed and set aside by the Luxembourg Court.

This decision was then appealed by the purported administrator, but this appeal was rejected by the Court.

A further appeal has been lodged by the purported administrator to the Luxembourg Cour de cassation

which overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision. The matter was referred back to the Luxembourg Court of

Appeal to consider the position on the merits but was dismissed. The consequence of these various actions

is that there is no escrow order in place. Finally, the administrator has brought a separate action challenging

the 2021 restructuring of the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This action raises similar allegations to those

made in the claw back action. The Luxembourg Court has yet to order a timetable for Mangrove LuxCo IV

S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l’ to file their defence.

Following an application of the purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., the District Court of Düsseldorf,

Germany, has issued an injunction (einstweilige Verfügung) against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l., ordering an

escrow agent to hold the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This order was successfully appealed and,

consequently, the injunction was lifted in June 2021. Further, by the same plaintiff, a main proceeding

(Hauptsacheverfahren) has been initiated against inter alios Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. A first hearing took

place in February 2023 with a decision announced for May 2023 (reference is made to section “9.3

Litigations”).

The intention of the Escrow Order is not to interfere with the ordinary course of business of GBG or of the

Group and as such where matters are in the ordinary course of business and the Trustee is requested to

vote the GBG Shares to approve such actions. Therefore, the Company as the parent company holds (1)

decision-making power over the relevant activities of GBG, (2) has rights to variable returns from the

investee and (3) can use its decision-making power to affect the variable returns. Furthermore, the

imposition of the Escrow Order has been contested by Mangrove.

###### Interests in associated companies and joint ventures

Associated are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but no control or joint control,

over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joined

control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets

and obligations for its liabilities. Interests in associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using

the equity method and at cost in case the company is not material. They are initially recognised at cost,

which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements

include the Group's share of profit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees, until the date on which

significant influence or joint control ceases for those that are accounted at equity.

Two associated companies are accounted at cost since they are not material.

Management deems the influence of the associated companies to the financial position of the Group as

insignificant.


-----

#### 2.7 Currency translation

The Mangrove Group companies prepare their annual financial statements on the basis of their respective

functional currencies.

Foreign currency transactions entered into by companies included in the consolidated financial statements

are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary

assets and liabilities are translated at the applicable exchange rate at each reporting date. Exchange rate

gains and losses resulting from these items are generally reported in the income statement under other

income or expenses. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical acquisition or production cost in

a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transaction. Non-monetary

items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as of the date

when the fair value was determined.

All financial statements of companies whose functional currencies differ from the reporting currency are

translated into the reporting currency used in the consolidated financial statements. The assets and

liabilities of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are translated at the middle

rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income statements of these companies are translated at the

average rates for the period under review. If these average rates are not a reasonable approximation of the

actual transaction rates, the income statements are translated at the relevant transaction rates. Any

translation differences are recognised and subsequently adjusted in other comprehensive income.

The following material foreign exchange rates are used for the currency conversion:

#### 2.8 Significant accounting and valuation policies

###### Consolidation methods

Acquired companies are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration paid is measured

on the basis of the fair value of the assets received, the liabilities assumed from the seller, and the equity

instruments issued at the transaction date. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent

liabilities assumed in the business combination are recognised at their fair value at the transaction date,

irrespective of any non-controlling interests. Any contingent consideration agreed is recognised at fair value

at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

The excess of cost over the share of the fair value of the company’s net assets acquired is recognised as

goodwill. If, after a further examination, cost is lower than the share of the fair value of the subsidiary’s

acquired net assets measured at fair value, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.


-----

Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed within the period they occur.

Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets

at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control

are accounted for as equity transactions.

Where a subsidiary is disposed of, such that control is no longer held, the entity is removed from the

consolidation as at the date when control ceases.

If individual group companies have a different reporting date, they are included on the basis of interim

financial statements as of the respective reporting date.

**Goodwill**

**Determination of Goodwill**

Goodwill arising from business combinations in which a Mangrove Group company acts as the acquirer is

recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the

fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. It comprises

workforce, sustainability of the business, further evolutionary technology leadership and strategic premium.

**Impairment of Goodwill**

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the level of Mangrove Group’s segments, which have been identified

as cash-generating units. For the purposes of impairment testing, the goodwill arising from the recognition

of business combinations is allocated to the segments and segments that are expected to benefit from the

synergies generated by the business combination. If more than one segment (or business unit) profits from

an acquisition, the allocation is carried out using an appropriate allocation key.

Goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually and in situations of impairment indications. The

recoverable amount of a segment or business unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill.

The recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs of

disposal. Until the date this consolidated financial statement was prepared, there was no indication that the

goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amount of a segment or business unit is compared with its carrying amount including

goodwill. The recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs

of disposal and is calculated annually at the end of the fiscal year using a discounted cash flow method.

An impairment loss initially reduces the carrying amount of goodwill. Any amount exceeding goodwill is
allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non-current non-financial assets. These reductions in
the carrying amounts are treated as impairment losses in the profit and loss statement.

**Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets include both internally generated and purchased assets. Internally generated

intangible assets comprise capitalized development costs. In addition to contract-based rights, purchased

intangible assets mainly contain technologies, brand names, and customer relationships. Technologies,

brand names, and customer relationships are usually acquired in connection with acquisitions. Internally

generated and acquired intangible assets are recognised at cost. If the useful life of an intangible asset can

be determined, following its initial recognition, the asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful

life. Acquisition cost and conversion cost includes borrowing costs as long as the criteria are met. In financial

years 2021 and 2022 no borrowing costs have been capitalized.

The carrying amount of an intangible asset is reviewed in case it is likely to be impaired by events or changes

in circumstances. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least once a


-----

year. This requires the recoverable amount of the assets to be determined. The recoverable amount

corresponds to the higher of internal value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. If the carrying amount

is higher than the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired to the recoverable amount. Previously

recognised impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment no longer apply. Impairment

losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortized historical cost.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and any

impairment losses, plus reversals of impairment losses. Cost also includes borrowing costs as long as the

recognition criteria are met. In financial year 2022 no borrowing costs have been capitalized. Land is not

subject to scheduled depreciation. All other assets are depreciated over the expected useful life of the

assets.

Expenses for major regular maintenance are amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset concerned

or over the period to the next maintenance date.

The carrying amount of items of property, plant and equipment is reviewed in case it is likely to be impaired

by events or changes in circumstances. An impairment test is performed by comparing the asset’s carrying

amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of internal value in

use and fair value less costs to sell (net realizable value). Fair value is primarily determined on the basis of

the current local market price for used machinery or commercial real estate. If the carrying amount exceeds

the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized. To assess impairment, assets are grouped at the

lowest level for which separate cash flows can be identified. If the reason for the impairment subsequently

ceases to apply, the impairment loss is reversed up to a maximum of the amortized historical cost.

**Leases**

At inception of a contract, Mangrove Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract

is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period

of time in exchange for consideration.

**Leases as a lessee**

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, Mangrove Group

allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone

prices. However, for the leases of property the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components

and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group recognises a

right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially

measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments

made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs

to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is

located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the

straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers

ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use

asset reflects that Mangrove Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will

be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those

of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses,

if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured

at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using

the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental

borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.


-----

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external

financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset

leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

   - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

   - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate

as at the commencement date;

   - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and

   - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease

payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension

option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to

terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when

there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in

the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the

Mangrove Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination

option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying

amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use

asset has been reduced to zero.

**Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets**

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets

and short-term leases, including IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with

these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Leases as a lessor**

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, Mangrove Group allocates

the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices.

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or

an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially

all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease

is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain

indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease

separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising

from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which

the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the

consideration in the contract.

The Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the

lease. The Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the

gross investment in the lease.


-----

**Other financial assets**

Other financial assets include investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments,

other securities, financial receivables (except trade receivables), derivative financial instruments, bonds and

bank loans.

According to IFRS 9 Shares in unconsolidated subsidiaries are allocated to the “fair value through other

comprehensive income” (FVOCI) measurement category. A financial asset is measured at fair value through

OCI if the objective of the business model is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial

assets. Mangrove Group has opted to recognize future changes in their fair value through other

comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income and to continue to classify them as

equity upon the derecognition of the financial instrument. As for new instruments, Mangrove Group can

opt to make use of this option on an instrument-by-instrument basis upon recognition, but it must continue

to do so thereafter.

Financial assets included within the fair value through OCI category are initially recognised and subsequently

measured at fair value. Movements in the carrying amount should be recorded through OCI. The fair value

assessment of the the investements was insignificant.

According to IFRS 9 Financial receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest

method. The effective interest method has no effect as the financial receivables are short-term. According

to IFRS 9 the sold receivables need to be remeasured as Fair value through profit and loss. Due to the

recoverability of sold trade receivables the fair value is equal to the amortized costs.

Derivative financial instruments are used exclusively for hedging purposes, in particular to economically

hedge currency risk which arises mainly from sales and procurement transactions. Fair value changes are

carried at fair value through profit and loss. Hedge Accounting in the sence IFRS 9 is not applied.

Embedded financial derivatives are separated from their host contracts, which are not measured at fair

value through profit or loss, if the economic characteristics and the risk of the embedded derivative are not

closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Separable embedded

derivatives are measured at fair value at initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting date. The fair

value of the embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option price model. For the valuation, the

credit spread used is calibrated to make the model reproduce the current market price at the valuation date.

Following initial recognition, changes in fair value is recognised through profit or loss. Mangrove Group has

identified certain options embedded in the indentures and hence, separated it from the host contract.

Financial assets or groups of financial assets, which are not measured as amortized costs, are tested for

indications of impairment at each reporting date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income

statement. If one or more events occurred after initial recognition of the asset and there is objective

evidence that the expected future cash flows decline, financial assets are impaired. Objective evidence of

impairment may be, for example, significant financial difficulties of the debtor or payment default. In the

case of financial assets measured at amortized cost (e.g. unquoted equity instruments), the impairment loss

corresponds to the difference between the carrying amount of the financial instrument and the present

value of the future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.

Financial assets are recognised as soon as Mangrove Group receives a cash payment or has the right to

receive cash flows. In the case of regular sales of non-derivative financial assets, the settlement date (i.e.,

the delivery date of the financial assets) is decisive. Assets are derecognised as soon as the right to receive

cash payments or other financial assets expires as a result of payment, waiver, statutory limitation,

offsetting, or any other factor. The same applies if the right is transferred to another person, with the risks

passing in full to the acquirer. In the case of regular way sales of non-derivative financial assets, the


-----

settlement date is taken to be the date of derecognition, in line with the principle used for recognition.

If the reasons for impairment no longer apply, impairment losses on financial assets – with the exception of

equity instruments – are reversed to income up to the amount of the amortized cost / net realizable value

that would have applied if no impairment loss had been charged.

**Inventories**

Inventories are recognised at cost and measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Acquisition

cost is calculated at average cost or using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Production cost includes direct

costs plus materials and production overheads, depreciation, and production-related administrative costs.

Net realizable value is calculated as the estimated sale proceeds less costs incurred until completion and

selling expenses. Previously recognised impairment losses must be reversed if the reasons for the

impairment no longer apply. Impairment losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amortized historical

cost.

Acquisition cost and conversion cost include borrowing costs as long as the criteria are met. In financial years

2021 and 2022 no borrowing costs have been capitalized.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables include no interest component and are recognised with their principal amount less

appropriate allowances for bad debts. Trade receivables are measured as amortized costs. The gross

carrying amount is not calculated by the effective interest method as all of Group´s trade receivables are

short-term.

The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract

assets. Loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal

to lifetime expected credit losses. Exposures within each credit risk grade are segmented by geographic

region and the loss rate is calculated for each region based on actual credit loss experience over the past

three years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors (gdp growth rates) to reflect differences between

economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions

and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

Trade receivables sold to financial services companies under factoring agreements are derecognised once

the majority of risks and rewards have been transferred to the financial services company. According to IFRS

9 this amount has to be remeasured as fair value through profit and loss because these are no longer

categorized as hold-to-collect when sold. For factored receivables the principal is regularly paid earlier by

the factoring bank than cash would have been obtained from the customer. For factored receivables the

principal is regularly paid earlier by the factoring bank than cash would have been obtained from the

customer. Due to the recoverability of sold trade receivables the fair value is equal to the amortized costs.

The Group does not consider the risk profile of its trade and other receivables to have changed materially

as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and cash deposits with maturities of three months or less

from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in fair value.

**Obligations under pension plans**

Obligations under pension plans relate to post-employment benefit obligations. Defined benefit obligations

are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The present value of these obligations reflects

expected future salary and pension trends, since the entitlements earnable in the period up to the


-----

retirement age depend on those. The pension obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial reports by

independent actuaries.

In order to provide those pension benefits, financial assets are held in long-term funds outside Mangrove

Group and qualifying insurance policies. As long as as the entitlements are funded by such external assets

(plan assets), their fair value is offset against the present value of the defined benefit obligation. The

resulting net amount is reported under non-current employee benefit obligations or other non-current

financial assets (net carrying amount).

Actuarial gains and losses from the remeasurement of the net carrying amount are recognised in other

comprehensive income of the year in which they arise and are reported in other comprehensive income

after adjustment for tax effects. This also applies to the recognition of the difference between the actual

returns on plan assets and the expected return calculated using the discount rate. Net interest – comprising

interest income on plan assets and interest cost on the defined benefit obligation – on the net carrying

amount is recognised in interest expenses. Current and past service cost for the period as well as gains and

losses from settlements are recognised in the respective functional areas as cost.

**Other employee benefit obligations**

Other employee benefit obligations comprise other long-term benefits and all short-term benefits. The

short-term obligations from short-term employee benefits are expected to be paid in full not later than 12

months after completion of the rendered service. They include wages, salaries, social insurance

contributions, paid vacation, and profit-sharing schemes. They are recognised as an expense simultanously

as the work is performed. Any expenditure in excess of the payments already made is reported as a deferred

liability at the reporting date. Other long-term employee benefits, such as jubilee payments or partial

retirement arrangements, are recognised at the actuarial present value of the obligation at the reporting

date. Securities are pledged to the beneficiaries to protect vested partial retirement credits against the

employer’s insolvency. The fair value of these securities is offset against the corresponding liability.

**Provisions**

Provisions for uncertain liabilities are recognised in case of a legal or constructive obligation to a third party,

a future outflow of resources is likely, and if the expected settlement value can be estimated reliably. The

present value of the settlement amount is recognised if the time value of money is material. Amounts are

discounted at the market rates for the appropriate maturity and currency. The interest unwinding costs are

presented under interest expense.

**Warranty Provisions**

The cost of creating warranty provisions is included in the cost of sales when revenue is recognized. The

provision is measured on the basis of both the warranty cost actually incurred in the past and on the

evaluated overall risk inherent in the system or product. Provisions are also recognised if a claim is made

under a warranty and a loss is likely. Recourse claims against suppliers are capitalized if their services are

subject to a warranty and it is highly likely that the claim can be enforced. The group does not identify any

performance obligations on the sence of IFRS 15.

**Provisions for onerous contracts**

Provisions for expected losses from onerous contracts are recognised if the unavoidable costs of meeting

the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The

unavoidable costs also include the unavoidable overheads needed to meet the obligations.


-----

**Provisions for restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring

plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicity. Future operating losses

are not provided for.

**Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities in particular include derivatives, preferred equity certificates, bonds, liabilities to banks

and liabilities under finance leases. They are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. They are

subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Liabilities under finance

leases are initially measured at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of

minimum lease payments.

**Other liabilities**

The recognition and subsequent measurement of other liabilities is the same as for financial liabilities, with

the exception of advance payments and the gross amount due to customers for contract work. Advance

payments are stated at their principal amount. Please see the information provided on the recognition of

construction contracts for the measurement of the gross amount due to customers for contract work.

**Contract assets and liabilities**

Other contract assets are recognized if the contract costs incurred and the gains recognized exceed the

progress billings and advance payments received or due. Advance payments on orders and the gross amount

due to customers for contract work are carried under “contract liabilities”. Advance payments on orders are

statet at their nominal amount. If the advance payments received or due exceed the capitalized costs and

recognized gains, less the progress billings at the reporting date, they are reported as a liability under

contract liabilities.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables also include liabilities for goods received or services rendered that have not yet been

invoiced, as there is only slight uncertainty of the amount of the liability. Trade payables are recognised at

amortized costs. This corresponds to the settlement amount in the case of liabilities due within one year.

**Revenue Recognition**

The Mangrove Group reports revenue according to three revenue types, namely construction contracts,

sale of goods and services and service agreements:

   - Revenues from construction contracts are recognized over time in accordance with IFRS 15

(“percentage-of-completion method”) since the customer obtains control through their

specifications over the duration of the contract and because the Mangrove Group is entitled

to reimbursement of the costs incurred so far, plus an appropriate margin, if the customer

cancels a contract. The percentage-of-completion is determined using the cost-to-cost

method, which is derived from the ratio of contract costs incurred to the total estimated

contract costs as of the reporting date. Contract costs include direct costs plus materials and

construction overheads, depreciation, production-related administrative costs, and such

other costs that are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the contract.

Adjustments are made for variations in contract work, claims, and incentive payments insofar

as these will probably result in revenue that is capable of being reliably estimated. Changes

in estimates or differences between the estimated cost and the actual cost have a direct

impact on recognized earnings from construction contracts. In addition, estimation limits

must be observed. In line with this method, construction contracts are measured at the


-----

amount of the contract costs incurred as of the reporting date plus the profit attributable to

the proportion of work completed. The costs incurred and the related profits are reported

under contract assets, less progress billings and advance payments received or due. If, while

a performance obligation is being satisfied, the contract costs incurred are not proportionate

to the progress of the performance of said contract, revenues will be recognized only to the

extent of the contract costs incurred (“zero-profit-method”). A profit is only recognized when

the contract costs incurred are matched by corresponding progress of the performance of

the contract. Contract costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are

incurred. If it is foreseeable that total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the

expected loss is recognized as an impending loss according to IAS 37.

   - Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognized when such goods are transferred

to the customer, or when services were carried out, and the contractual performance

obligations are therefore met. Performance obligations are satisfied as the customer obtains

control over the goods sold to them, i.e. when they can direct the use of and obtain essentially

all the remaining benefits from the goods.

   - Revenue from service agreements is recognized over the period in which the service is

performed. If only the sale of spare parts is involved, revenue is recognized at a specific point

in time.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received. Customer

bonuses, discounts, or rebates reduce the amount of revenue recognized. Payments for differences in

the overall contract, claims, and premiums are included in the contract revenue as variable components.

The amount of such payments is calculated at contract inception using the “expected-value” method 
if there are several different possible amounts - or the “most likely amount” method - if there are just

two possible amounts. The effects of significant financing components can be ignored when

determining the amount of revenue to be recognized if the vendor expects, at contract inception, that

the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to the customer and the date of payment

will be one year or less. Discretion must be applied when judging whether revenues are to be recognized

“over time”, as well as with regard to the allocation of the transaction price to the performance

obligation. Where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, these are estimated.

The Group uses various input and output methods to ensure that revenues from contracts with

customers are faithfully represented. The portion of revenues which fall under the IFRS 15 requirements

with respect to revenue recognized over time is around 35% each year. Almost two thirds of revenue,

around 65% of sales of goods and services, is recognized at a point in time.

**Research and development**

Research expenditures are recognised immediately as an expense.

Development costs that are designed to significantly enhance a product or process are capitalized if

completion of the product or process is technically and economically feasible, the development is

marketable, the expenditures can be measured reliably, and adequate resources are available to complete

the development project.

Development expenditure is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measures reliably, the product or

process is technically feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has

sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.


-----

Development costs that are required under construction contracts are capitalized as part of the cost of the

asset.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at fair value provided that Mangrove Group meets the conditions

necessary to receive the grant. Government grants to cover expenses are recognised over the period in

which the costs for which the grants were awarded are incurred. Government grants for capital expenditure

are deducted from the cost of purchasing the corresponding asset.

**Income Tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent

that it relates to a business combination, or related items are recognised directly in equity or in other

comprehensive income (OCI).

**Current Tax**

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or tax receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year

and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured on the

reporting date using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the

reporting period. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.

**Deferred taxes**

Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets

and liabilities for financial reporting and the amount used for taxation purposes. Deferred taxes are not

recognised for:

   - Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not

a business combination and that effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

   - Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associated and joint arrangements

to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary

differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

   - Taxable differences arising on the initial recognition on goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary

differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they

can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it

is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Such reductions are reversed when the

probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it

has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when

they reverse, using the tax rate enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.

**Single assets held for sale, discontinued operations and disposal groups**

A single non-current asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally

through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The Group reports assets and liabilities as a

disposal group, that will be disposed of by sale or otherwise in a single transaction, which collectively meet

the held for sale criteria as specified in IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued


-----

Operations”. The Group reports the assets and liabilities of a disposal group separately in the balance sheet

line item “assets held for sale” and “liabilities held for sale”, respectively. Unless a disposal group qualifies

for discontinued operations reporting, the revenues and expenses of the disposal group remain within

continuing operations until the date of disposal. The Group reports the results of a disposal group that also

qualifies as a component of the Group as discontinued operations if it represents a separate major line of

business or geographical area of operations. The Group reports the results of discontinued operations in the

period in which they occur separately within the consolidated statement of income as “discontinued

operations (net of tax)”. In the consolidated statement of cash flows the cash flows resulting from

discontinued operations are presented separately from cash flows resulting from continuing operations;

prior year presentation has been adjusted accordingly. In order to present the proportion of income/loss

attributable to discontinued operations, net sales and expenses arising from intercompany transactions are

recognised provided that these transactions will not continue after the disposal of the discontinued

operations.

On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets are recognised at the lower of the carrying amount

and fair value less costs to sell and depreciation and amortization ceases. A disposal group is initially

measured in line with the respective IFRS standards to determine the carrying amount of the disposal group

which is then compared to the fair value less costs to sell of the group in order to recognize the disposal

group at the lower of both amounts. An impairment loss initially reduces the carrying amount of goodwill.

Any amount exceeding goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non-current non
financial assets. These reductions in the carrying amounts are treated as impairment losses in the in the

profit and loss statement.

#### 2.9 Estimates and management judgement

Judgement was applied in the determination of excluding subsidiaries from or including subsidiaries into

consolidation.

Preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates

that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and contingent

liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during

the period under report. While these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current

events and circumstances, actual results may ultimately differ from the estimates set forth. Estimates and

the underlying assumptions are subject to ongoing review. Revisions to estimates are recognised

prospectively.

Factors that may cause amounts to fall below estimates might include a deterioration in the global economy,

movements in exchange rates and interest rates, as well as material litigation and changes in environmental

or other legislation. Production errors, the loss of key customers, and rising borrowing costs may also

adversely affect the Group’s future performance.

The major areas subject to considerable estimating uncertainty, or to particular discretion in the application

of accounting and measurement methods, are presented in the following notes disclosure:

**Measurement of property plant and equipment, and intangible assets**

Measurement of property plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the use of estimates for

determining the fair value at the acquisition date, provided they were acquired in a business combination.

Furthermore, the expected useful lives of these assets must be estimated. The determination of the fair

values of assets as well as the useful lives of the assets is based on management's judgement.


-----

**Determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets**

The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets involves the use

of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing, and amount of the impairment.

Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions,

expectations of growth in the heat exchanger industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future

availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of services, current replacement costs,

prices paid in comparable transactions, and other changes in circumstances, which indicate that an

impairment exists. The identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows

and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) require management to make significant

judgements concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows,

applicable discount rates, useful lives, and residual values.

The carrying amounts of intangible assets, items of property, plant and equipment, and groups of cash
generating units with goodwill are reviewed if they are likely to have been impaired by events or changes in

circumstances. In addition, indefinite-lived intangible assets and cash-generating units with goodwill are

tested for impairment at least once a year. The impairment test compares the asset’s carrying amount

against its recoverable amount ( “impairment test”) . The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of

internal value in use and fair value less costs of disposal ( net realizable value) . An estimate of fair value less

costs to sell is only required if the value in use is less than the carrying amount. If the carrying amount

exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognized. In this

case, the impairment loss is first deducted from the goodwill of the cash- generating unit with goodwill. Any

amount exceeding goodwill is allocated proportionately to the carrying amounts of non- current non
financial assets. Fair value less costs of disposal is generally the benchmark for measuring the impairment

of segments classified as “held for sale”.

The valuations of other intangible assets, which were performed as part of the impairment test, are based

on management assumptions. Previously recognized impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the

impairment no longer apply, except in the case of goodwill. Impairment losses are reversed up to a

maximum of the amortized historical cost.

In total, impairments amounting to EUR 3,114 thousand for property, plant and equipment and intangible

assets were to be recorded in FY 2022 (prior year: EUR 1,543 thousand).

**Leases**

The Group uses estimates and judgements that affect the determination of the lease term – e.g. determining

the enforceable period and whether a lessee is reasonably certain either to exercise a renewal option or not

to exercise a termination option. The Mangrove group determines the lease term at the commencement

date. As a lessee, the group is required to reassess the lease term on the occurrence of a significant event

or change in circumstances that is within its control and directly affects whether it si reasonably certain to

exercise (or not to exercise) an option included in the original contract. Both lessees and lessors revise the

lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period. This requires ongoing monitoring and increases

financial statement volatility.

Lease payments are discountinued at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readibly be determined.

Otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate, which is

mainly applied, is based on the risk adjusted interst rates and detmined for the respective lease terms and

currencies.


-----

**Scope of consolidation**

Judgement was applied in the determination of excluding subsidiaries from consolidation on the basis of

materiality (see Note 2.6).

**Impairment**

The Group recognises loss allowances for ECLs on financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt

investments measured at FVOCI and contract assets. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount

equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the following, which are measured at 12-month (a) ECLs debt securities

that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; (b) and other debt securities and bank

balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial

instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables

(including lease receivables) and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial

recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that

is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative

information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment, that

includes forward-looking information. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has

increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when (a) the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit

obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is

held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt

securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that

have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence

that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: (a) significant financial

difficulty of the debtor or it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial

reorganization.

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying

amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is

recognised in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no

reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.

**Recognition and measurement on deferred tax assets and income tax uncertainties**

Mangrove Group operates in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to different tax

jurisdictions. Calculating tax liabilities requires management to make various estimates. Management

believes that it has made a reasonable estimate of tax uncertainties. However, no assurance can be given

that the actual outcome of these uncertainties will correspond to the estimates made. Any deviations may

have an impact on the level of tax liabilities or deferred taxes in the year of the decision.

When assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management judges the extent to which

realization of the deferred tax assets is sufficiently likely. The question of whether the deferred tax assets

can actually be realized depends on whether sufficient future taxable income can be generated against

which the temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards can be offset. Management therefore analyzes

the times at which the deferred tax liabilities reverse, and expected future taxable income. Management

forecasts whether deferred tax assets can be realized on the basis of expected future taxable income.

Deferred tax assets decline if the estimate of planned taxable income decreases, tax benefits available as a

result of tax strategies are reduced, or the amount or timing of future tax benefits is restricted by changes

in law (see Note 7.7).


-----

IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 when there is

uncertainty about the income tax treatment. For recognition and measurement, estimates and assumptions

must be made, e.g. whether an estimate is made separately or together with other uncertainties, a most

likely amount or expected amount for the uncertainty is used and whether changes have occurred

compared to the previous period. The risk of detection from tax authorities is irrelevant for the recognition

of uncertain balance sheet items. Accounting is based on the assumption that the tax authorities are

investigating the matter in question and that they have all relevant information at their disposal.

**Recognition and calculation of construction contracts**

Identification and definition of performance obligation, as well as timing of revenue recognition are based

on managements estimates. Further the recognition of construction contracts using the percentage of

completion method is based on management’s estimates of the cost to complete the contracts. Changes in

estimates or differences between the estimated cost and the actual cost to complete have a direct effect on

recognised earnings from construction contracts. The operating units continuously review the estimates and

adjust them if required.

**Obligations under pension plans**

The present value of pension obligations depends on actuarial assumptions. These assumptions comprise

discount rates, expected wage and salary increases, as well as the pension growth rate and mortality rates.

These assumptions can differ significantly from actual future outcomes as a result of changes in market and

economic conditions, and can therefore have a material effect on the level of the obligation and the related

expenses.

The discount rate of the net carrying amount is calculated at the end of each year. This is the rate used to

calculate the present value of future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the obligation. In order

to calculate the discount rate, Mangrove Group uses the interest rate on high-quality corporate bonds

denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are paid and whose terms to maturity correspond

to those of the pension obligations.

Other significant assumptions relating to pension obligations are based on market conditions (see Note

6.4.1).

**Litigation**

In some cases, Mangrove Group companies are parties to litigation. The outcome of this litigation could

have a material effect on Mangrove Group’s net assets, financial position, and results of operations.

Management regularly analyzes current information on these legal disputes and recognizes provisions for

probable obligations including legal costs. Both internal counsels and external lawyers make this

assessment. When deciding on the need to recognize provisions, management takes into account the

probability of an unfavorable outcome and its ability to estimate the amount of the obligation with sufficient

reliability. Material litigations described in Note 9.3.

**Determination of fair value of financial instruments**

The level of management judgement, required in establishing the fair value of financial instruments for

which there is a quoted price in an active market, is usually minimal. Similarly there is little subjectivity or

judgement required for instruments valued using valuation models which are standard across the industry

and where all input parameters are quoted in active markets (e.g. for foreign exchange rate derivatives).

The level of subjectivity and degree of management judgement required is more significant for those

instruments valued using models and techniques where some or all of the parameter inputs are less or not

observable. Management judgement is required in the selection and application of appropriate parameters,


-----

assumptions and modelling techniques. This applies especially in establishing the fair value of the embedded

derivatives.

## 3. Financial risk management

Mangrove Group applies guidelines and instruments, to manage and hence largely limit or hedge financial

risks throughout the Group.

The objectives with regard to protecting assets, eliminating gaps in security, and improving efficiency in

identifying and analyzing risks are clearly defined, as are the relevant organizational structures, powers, and

responsibilities. The guidelines are based on the principles of system security, separation of functions,

transparency, and immediate documentation.

Mangrove Group is exposed to currency, interest rate, commodity price, credit, and liquidity risk in the

course of its ordinary activities. Mangrove Group’s financial risk management aims to reduce this risk

through the appropriate use of derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments and avoids on principal

concentrations of risk.

**Currency risk**

The Mangrove Group has significant assets and liabilities outside the Eurozone, particularly in China, USA,

South Africa, Brazil, India, Poland, Czech Republic as well as Great Britain. These assets and liabilities are

denominated in local currency. When the net asset values are converted into euro, the currency fluctuations

result in period to period changes in those net asset values. The equity position of the Group reflects these

changes in net asset values.

The Mangrove Group also has transactional currency exposures which arise mostly from sales or purchases

in currencies other than the functional currency. In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate

fluctuations for the operating business, all companies are required to economically hedge foreign currency

items, as they arise in order to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates. Currency risks are economically

hedged for recognized assets and liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and highly probable

forecasted transactions, when denominated in another currency than the functional currency of the

company. The hedging periods are determined by the maturity of the economical hedged items and are

usually up to twelve months but may also exceed that period significantly in exceptional cases.

Hedge Accounting in the sense of IFRS 9 is not applied.

All economic hedging transactions - to the extent being legally permissible - are handled by Mangrove Group

Treasury. The group companies report their exposures to Group Treasury, which enters on behalf of the

respective companies into corresponding derivative transactions with banks. The economical hedging

transactions are closely monitored by Mangrove Group Treasury.

Besides the hedging requirement, currency fluctuations may affect business opportunities outside the

Eurozone.

**Interest rate risk**

The Mangrove Group is exposed to interest rate risks which mainly relate to debt obligations, as the Group

borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The interest rate risk is monitored by using the cash

flow sensitivity of the Group’s cash flows due to floating interest loans.

**Commodity price risk**

As part of its operating activities, Mangrove Group requires various raw materials, whose purchase prices


-----

can be subject to substantial fluctuations depending on the market situation. Long-term supply agreements

have been entered into with various suppliers in order to reduce commodity price risk.

**Credit risk**

The credit risk refers to the risk that counterparties may default on their contractual obligations resulting in

a financial loss to the Mangrove Group. In general Mangrove Group has adopted a policy of only dealing

with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral in form of advanced payments where

appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.

The Mangrove Group monitors the exposure and the credit ratings of its existing and potential

counterparties continuously. Companies active in the component business use credit limits to assess their

counterparty default risk, whereas a maximum risk limit is defined for each party. In most cases this limit is

derived from recognized credit rating agencies and credit default swaps if available. Appropriate action is

taken if the individual limit is exceeded. Companies active in the project business ascertain the financial

standing of potential customers on a case by case basis using all available financial information. Before a

project order is accepted the assessment is additionally reviewed in an internal risk board procedure.

An appropriate credit management, including a credit insurance, is also conducted to reduce credit risk. In

the case of export transactions, confirmed and unconfirmed letters of credit are used alongside sureties,

guarantees, and cover notes, including from export credit agencies.

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across different industries and regions.

Hence there is no concentration of risk. Valuation allowances take account of specific credit risks.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables

and contract assets as at 31 December 2022:

**Risk Cluster** **Gross carrying amount** **Weighted average loss rate** **Loss allowance kEUR**

Western Europe 52,306 0.53% 278

Asia Pacific 38,552 1.71% 660

North America 71,654 0.35% 247

Rest of World 22,114 0.84% 185

**Total** **184,626** **0.74%** **1,370**

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables and contract assets during

the year was as follows:

**(EUR million)** **12/31/22** **12/31/21**

Opening Balance 10.5 16.3

Additions 3.4 5.3

Utilization -3 -11.1

**Closing Balance** **10.9** **10.5**

Derivative financial instruments are concluded only with financial institutions with high credit-ratings

assigned by international credit-rating agencies so as to reduce the credit risk involved.

The Mangrove Group does not have any critical credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group

of counterparties having similar characteristics. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited

because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating

agencies and also typically are lenders to the Group. Therefore, credit quality of financial assets which are

neither past due nor impaired is assessed to be good. The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial

assets is the carrying amount.


-----

**Liquidity risk**

Mangrove Group is exposed to liquidity risk in a way that it may be unable to meet payment obligations

because it has insufficient cash funds at its disposal. To manage Mangrove Group’s short, medium and long
term funding and liquidity requirements the management has established an appropriate liquidity risk

control framework consisting inter alia of a multi-year financial plan and a rolling month-by-month cash

forecast. The Group manages the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities, and

reserve borrowing facilities as well as by monitoring forecasted cash flows at regular intervals.

The cash flow from operating activities is the most important source of liquidity. In order to optimize

borrowing and the use of cash funds within the Group, cash pools in various countries are established. The

cash pools automatically balance the accounts of the participating companies every day by crediting or

debiting a target account. This prevents separate cash investments and borrowings by these companies to

a large extent.

The following table shows the undiscounted contractually agreed interest and principal payments for
financial liabilities, including derivative financial instruments with negative fair values:

All financial liabilities outstanding as of December 31, 2022, are included in the above table on the basis of

expected contractual cash flows. Projected figures for future new liabilities are not taken into account.

Foreign currency amounts are translated at the closing rates. In the case of financial liabilities that can be

repaid at any time, it is assumed that they will be repaid within one year.

Despite the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related supply chain issues, the Group

considers that it has the ability to generate sufficient cash inflows, such that the liquidity risk of the Group

is low, as minimum operating cash requirements will not be breached. Forecast scenarios are updated

regularly and the Group has the ability to act to boost liquidity if necessary.

The payment comprises accrued interest and redemption.

Credit lines and guarantees are discussed in Note “9.2 Other financial obligations”.

**Foreign currency sensitivity analysis**

Mangrove Group companies are always exposed to foreign currency risk if their cash flows are denominated

in a currency other than their own functional currency. Foreign currency risk is economically hedged using

suitable instruments, thus largely offsetting fluctuations arising from the economical hedged item and the

economical hedging transaction over their term.

The foreign currency risk presented in the sensitivity analysis results from the following transactions:

- Currency derivatives that are terminated for hedging of previously unrecognized economical hedged

items, i.e., for contractually agreed or expected transactions. These hedging derivatives are affecting profit

or loss by exchange rate risk.

- Unsecured foreign currency transactions

- The translation of foreign currency receivables or liabilities at the closing rate has a direct effect on

earnings.

The major part of the foreign currency cash flows is settled in the currency pairs that are named in the

following table. The foreign currencies are included as relevant risk variables in the foreign currency

sensitivity analysis. The figures show the sensitivity of a 10 percent increase or decrease in the foreign

currency in relation to the base currency:

-----

The calculation has been performed on a nominal underlying of EUR 210,078 thousand (prior year: EUR

155,929 thousand).

The nominal amount relates to all contractually agreed foreign currency cash flows as of the reporting date

which are translated into euros at the closing rate.

The potential fluctuations in the profit or loss for the year result primarily from unhedged currency

**Interest rate sensitivity analysis**

An interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest

payments, and interest income and expenses. A sensitivity analyses is not done due to the following

assumptions and instruments:

- Non-derivative fixed-income financial instruments are only subject to balance-sheet interest rate risk

if they are measured at fair value. Mangrove Group measures such financial instruments at amortized

cost.

- Non-derivative variable rate financial instruments whose interest payments are not included as

hedged items in an economical hedging relationship that is recognized as a cash flow hedge are subject

to interest rate risk both in the income statement and in cash flow (cash flow interest rate risk and

interest rate risk recognized in profit or loss). The issued fixed rate senior secured bond is the only

material financial instrument. Thus, no interest rase rate sensitive analysis is applicable.

- Embedded derivatives that were separated from the bonds do not include material interest rate risk

due to a change in fair value which derives from various early redemption options.

- Currency derivatives are not subject to material interest rate risk and therefore have no effect on

interest rate sensitivity.

**Capital management**

Mangrove Group’s capital management covers both equity and liabilities. An objective is to maintain

sufficient and equal levels of working capital, current assets, and current liabilities. Due to the broad product

range and the activities on global markets, under normal economic conditions Mangrove Group generates

predictable and sustainable cash flows.

Resources are allocated within the Mangrove Group primarily on the basis of strategic and medium-term

planning. This provides the framework for preparing key decisions on core technologies, sales markets, and

other strategically important variables.

Acquisitions and expansion investments are assessed not only on the basis of key performance indicators

showing potential returns, but also in terms of their importance for achieving the Group’s strategic goals.

The key economic criterion for evaluating rationalization and expansion investments is the net present value

of future cash flows associated with these investments. The payback period (i.e. the time until the initial

cash out from the investment has been recovered) is also calculated as an additional benchmark for

assessing the risk arising from changing economic conditions.

Working capital is another key element of capital employed. Working capital management begins before an

order is accepted with the payment terms that are offered or negotiated.

The capital structure is monitored with various key financial indicators of which the total net leverage ratio

is one of the key financial indicators. The ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the

RCF, is an important financial ratio (debt ratio) used in the Mangrove Group, especially for the covenants

## 5. Consolidated statement of financial position disclosures: Assets

#### 5.1 Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired

in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the end of the fiscal year and

whenever there is any indication of a potential impairment. The units to which the goodwill is allocated

represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent of

cash flows from other (groups of) assets and the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is

monitored for internal management purposes.

In the Mangrove Group, the 4 CGU-segments are coming from four business units Refrigeration

Technologies, Machine Cooling Systems, Kelvion Thermal Solutions and Plate Heat Exchangers.

The goodwill arose from the acquisition of the Galapagos BidCo Group on October 9, 2019. Goodwill

primarily derives from future growth that is expected with new customers and new technological

developments. No goodwill was allocated to the former cash-generating unit ENEXIO, as the economic

situation does not justify a goodwill.

The following table shows the allocation of goodwill to the cash-generating units of the Mangrove Group:

**Kelvion** **Total**


**Kelvion**
**Thermal**
**Solutions**


**Refrigeration**
(EUR thousand)
**Technologies**


**Machine**

**Cooling**
**Systems**


**Plate Heat**
**Exchangers**


**Goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2021** 32,746 40,630 18,140 33,758 **125,275**

**Goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2022** 32,746 40,630 18,140 33,758 **125,275**

The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit of the Group as of December 31, 2022 is determined

by calculating an individual value in use by applying the discounted cash flow method taking into account

existing business developments as well as long-term expectations. The business plan consists of a detailed

planning for the year 2023 as well as a strategic planning for the years 2024 and 2025. This detailed planning

has been expanded by two years, of which the year 2026 is a transitional period and the year 2027 is used

as terminal value.

The business plan for the Mangrove Group is based on CGU-specific assumptions about the trend in key

macroeconomic parameters such as gross domestic product, market share, trends in labor costs, as well as

trends in the cost of raw materials and regulatory framework conditions. Based on this, plan key figures are

developed for each CGU for the three-year planning period, which are used to derive at net cash flows to

complete the planning process prepared by segment's key management and discussed in shareholder

committees.

In the base case scenario of the business plan no impairment incurred as shown in the table below.

**Kelvion** **Total**


**Kelvion**
**Thermal**
**Solutions**


**Refrigeration**
(EUR thousand)
**Technologies**


**Machine**

**Cooling**
**Systems**


**Plate Heat**
**Exchangers**


**Recoverable amount as of Dec. 31, 2022** 151,325 106,065 252,956 157,399 **667,745**

**Carrying amount as of Dec. 31, 2022** 97,387 94,085 57,101 156,618 **405,911**

**Headroom as of Dec. 31, 2022** 53,987 11,261 195,855 781 **261,834**


-----

Although the estimation of the discounted future cash flows is believed to be appropriate, changes in

assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis. The goodwill impairment test as of

December 31, 2022 leads to no impairment, as the recoverable amounts of the segments are higher than

the carrying amount of the respective segment assets.

The net cash inflows are discounted at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt

capital. To account for the different risk and return profiles of the Mangrove Group’s principal businesses,

the after-tax cost of capital is calculated separately for each unit and a specific capital structure is defined

by benchmarking against comparable companies in the same industry sector. The cost of equity corresponds

to the return expected by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the conditions on which

comparable companies can obtain long-term financing. Both components are derived from capital market

information.

The value in use is based on the following key assumptions: For the period beyond the detailed planning

horizon, cash flows are based on an extrapolation using a growth rate of 1.50 percent (FY 2021: 1.00

percent). The increase of 0.5 percent is mainly due to the fact that the assumption on the growth rate is

inflation driven growth. This underlying growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth for the

markets in which the segments operate. The CGU-specific total cost of capital assumed for discounting is

based on a risk-free long-term interest rate of 2 percent and a market risk premium of 7.5 percent.

Additionally, beta factors, a borrowing risk premium as well as capital structures were derived from a peer

group for each cash-generating unit. Also, unit-specific tax rates were applied.

The following table presents the applied sustainable growth rate and the cost of capital factors used to

discount the expected cash flows:


**Sustainable**
**Growth Rate**


**Weighted average**

**cost of capital**


**2022** **2022**

Refrigeration Technologies 1.50 % 10.55 %

Machine Cooling Systems 1.50 % 10.35 %

Kelvion Thermal Solutions 1.50 % 10.85 %

Plate Heat Exchangers 1.50 % 10.73 %

The Group carried out sensitivity analysis in line with IAS 36. The resulting recoverable amounts by varying

the sustainable EBIT Margin and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) simultaneously are presented

## 6. Consolidated statement of financial position: Equity
 and liabilities

#### 6.1 Equity

**Subscribed capital**

On July 11, 2019, the company has been founded with a registered share capital of EUR 12,000.00, by issuing

1,200,000 ordinary shares at a price of EUR 0.01. The subscribed capital is fully paid up. The entry in the

commercial register under the number B236258 was made on July 11, 2019.

**Legal reserve**

In accordance with relevant law, the Company is required to transfer a minimum of 5% of its net profit for

each financial year to a legal reserve. This requirement ceases to be necessary once the balance on the legal

reserve reaches 10% of the issued share capital. The legal reserve is not available for distribution to the

shareholders.

**Capital reserve**

Based on the shareholder resolution dated March 11, 2020, the sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à. r.l.

contributed EUR 140,000,000 into the capital contribution account (account 115 “apport en capitaux

propres non rémunéré par des titres“of the Luxembourg Standard Chart of Accounts) of the Company. With

Shareholder resolution as of December 22, 2020 the sole shareholder Mangrove LuxCo II S.à. r.l.

acknowledged to convert an aggregated amount of EUR 136,528,353 into tracking preferred equity

certificates (“TPECs”). The company issued 13,652,835,300 TPECs, having a value of EUR 0.01 each,

representing a total issue of EUR 136,528,353. The subscription of the TEPC´s was dated December 31, 2020.

Following the TPECs issuance and as security package in relation to certain facilities agreements entered

into by the Company (including a EUR 65 million revolving facility, a EUR 260 million facilities agreement and

a senior secured note indenture), the Company granted the TPECs pledge to the benefit of the Security

Agent and entered into the TPECs pledge agreement for the purpose thereof. The capital reserve as of

December 31, 2022 amounts to EUR 3,471,647.

the equity holder of the company. In 2022 KEUR 78 (prior year: KEUR 167) loss was attributable to the non
controlling interests. Non-controlling interest within EUR 0.2 million was increased in 2022. The major

changes are driven by increase in consolidation group within 1.5 mEUR. This Increase was partly netted with

EUR 0.9 million as dividends payuot . The remaining changes are driven by effects of foreign currency

fluctuations and income for the period.

#### 6.2 Tracking preferred equity certificates / Shareholder loan

**Provisions for guarantees and warranties**

Provisions for guarantees and warranties relate to warranty commitments for products and equipment, as

it is customary in the industry. The guarantees and warranties on which they are based are granted in

connection with certain performance criteria relating to products or equipment. Warranties usually have a

contractual term of between one and two years from the date on which the products or equipment are

accepted. In addition to warranties explicitly agreed under contract, product liability rules apply in many

countries and may also stipulate that the manufacturer is liable beyond the contractually defined term of

the warranty. In some cases, recourse claims exist in the form of insurance refunds or subcontractor

guarantees. The level of provisions is based on management’s best estimate.

**Litigation risks**

Provisions are recognized for risks arising from expected or pending litigation against Mangrove Group

companies if it is believed that there is likely to be an unfavorable outcome to the proceedings. Assessments

by counsel for the company or legal experts were used to determine the likelihood of such litigation. The

probable damages or sanctions have been recognized as a provision.

**Total employee benefit obligations** **59,243** **66,425**

###### 6.4.1 Defined benefit pension plans

Mangrove Group employees are offered various benefit options mainly in the form of defined benefit and

defined contribution pension plans. The defined benefit pension plan obligations mainly exist in Germany.

Mangrove Group grants old-age, disability, and survivors’ benefits to many of its employees. New

employees are generally only granted benefits that are partly funded by employee contributions.

As part of the general benefits provided all employees have the opportunity to voluntarily defer part of their

compensation. Under this arrangement an agreed amount of their salary plus an employer contribution of

up to 100 percent of the deferred amount is converted into a pension benefit. A corresponding collective

bargaining agreement was entered by the predecessors of the Group in 2002 and revised in 2008. The new

pension plan beginning in January 2019 does not only provide for pension payments, but also capital

payments and installment payments.

The post-retirement benefits are adjusted by minimum of 1 percent each year, according to the

occupational retirement act (§ 16 Betriebsrentengesetz). In 2022 post-retirement benefits are adjusted by

2.2 percent.

In addition to the currently open benefit schemes, there are a number of historical pension schemes in the

company. These schemes are generally closed to new employees but are maintained unchanged for


-----

employees who were members at the time the scheme was closed.

The pension liabilities are partly covered by reinsurance policies.

All liabilities were actuarially valued as of December 31, 2022.

Mangrove Group views granting pension benefits as an opportunity to foster employee loyalty and

engagement. It is therefore an integral part of the remuneration concept and has an appropriate employee

contribution component. In connection with this, Mangrove Group observes developments on the human

resources market and regularly checks that the benefits it grants are appropriate and in line with the market.

Mangrove Group does not believe that the pension liabilities pose any risks over and above the customary

extent and the general risks described above.

-----

**Actuarial assumptions**

As of the relevant reporting date, the following weighted actuarial assumptions were used to calculate the

present value of the defined benefit obligation relating to pension plans. These assumptions are used to

calculate the net pension expenses in the following year:

(Percent) **12/31/2022** **12/31/2021**

Discount factor 3.7 1.0

Inflation 2.2 1.8

derived: wage and salary increase rate 3.2 2.8

derived: pension increase rate 2.2 1.0

The actuarial measurement factors for German pension plans are established by Mangrove Group in

consultation with actuarial experts. The corresponding assumptions for the few pension plans outside

Germany are determined taking into account country-specific conditions. The discount rate is established

using a recognized method based on the return on high quality corporate bonds determined as of the

reporting date, taking into account the currency and maturities of the underlying liabilities.

All other assumptions correspond to the long-term expectations of Mangrove Group. The nominal rate of

wage and salary increases is calculated based on expected inflation and a real rate of increase. The rate of

pension increases in Germany is also determined based on inflation, provided that the pension adjustments

are determined in accordance with the rise in the cost of living. If a firm pension adjustment commitment

has been made, this is taken into account accordingly.

On 4 October 2018, Heubeck AG published new mortality tables (Heubeck mortality tables 2018G), for the

valuation of all German plans as at 31 December 2022, these tables are used. On this basis, the life

expectancy of a 65-year-old pensioner as of the reporting date is 21.63 years for men and 24.97 years for

women.

The sensitivities presented below were applied to the discount rate and inflation, which have been identified

as actuarial assumptions that have a significant influence on Mangrove Group’s benefit obligations. Since

the wage and salary increase rate and the pension increase rate are derived from inflation, sensitivity to

inflation was used to measure the sensitivity of these assumptions together. The same calculation methods

were used for sensitivities as for the recognized provisions. The ranges used to compute the sensitivities of

the assumptions are based on the changes that are deemed possible until the next reporting date, given

historical experience. The meaningfulness of historical experience for forecasts of future outcomes and

neglecting to update a number of assumptions simultaneously may represent limitations of these methods.

An increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate decreases the present value of the defined benefit

obligation by 5.56 percent. If the assumed inflation rate declines by 25 basis points, the present value of the

defined benefit obligation decreases by 0.17 percent.


-----

**Future cash flows**

The following benefit payments are expected to be made under the pension plans in the coming years:

(EUR thousand) **2023** **2024** **2025** **2026** **2027** **2028-2032**

Payments under pension plans 1.562 1.038 1.013 1.144 1.076 7.025

The average weighted duration of the pension obligations is:

(Years) **12/31/2022** **12/31/2021**

Duration 14.5 17.0

###### 6.4.2 Defined contribution pension plans

Various companies operate defined contribution pension plans. Under these plans, the obligation does not

lie with Mangrove Group, but with the respective pension funds. Contributions totaling EUR 2.627 thousand

(2021: EUR 3,031 thousand) were paid in the fiscal year 2022. Contributions of EUR 11,828 thousand (2021:

EUR 19,165 thousand) were paid to state pension insurance schemes. These contributions are recognized

as personnel expenses at the same time as the relevant service is rendered.

###### 6.4.3 Redundancy plan and severance payments

The provisions for redundancy plan liabilities and severance payments were mainly accrued for the

restructuring of ENEXIO´s Dry Cooling Business (announced in 2019) and for an overhead cost reduction

program in Kelvion that was communicated to the employees in late 2020. These restructuring and

optimization programs were proceeded mainly during 2020 and will be finalized in 2023.

In current financial year additional restructuring, due to relocation of Luvoproduction and K-Bloc Production

from Kelvion PHE GmbH to another sites, was announced. Social plan was announced in December 2022

and provision was created accordingly.

-----

As of December 31, 2022, the position Senior Secured Notes (SSNs) includes an Agio of EUR 22,273 thousand

(2021: EUR 29,933 thousand). The purchase price allocation recognized a contingent liability relating to the

SSNs which amounts to EUR 26,412 thousand (2021: EUR 34,165 thousand) as of December 31, 2022. The

agio and the contingent liability is amortized by using the effective interest rate method and recorded as an

additional interest expense in the interest result. Debt discount is being amortized in interest result using

the effective interest rate method. Accrued interests have been recognized as other current financial

liabilities.

**General remarks**

(“SSNs”) in connection with the acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group as described elsewhere in these notes

(e.g. in Sections 1. and 4.). The notes are due on the October 8, 2025 at which date the principal shall be

payable in full. The notes were issued under an indenture among, inter alia, the issuer, Mangrove LuxCo III

S.à r.l. as well as the issuer’s subsidiaries that guarantee the notes. Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and Kelvion

Finance GmbH, and GLAS Trustee Limited act as trustee.

**Interest on the notes and right to defer interest payments in cash in 2021 and 2022**

The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.775% per annum and will be payable in cash, semi-annually in arrears

on June 15 and December 15 of each year; provided that with respect to the interest periods ending June

15, 2021, December 15, 2021, June 15, 2022 and/or December 15, 2022, the Company may, in its sole

discretion, elect (if such election is necessary to ensure compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant

and clean-down provision as per the terms of the New RCF on the relevant interest payment date and the

twelve months following thereafter) to capitalize part of its interest payments for those periods, with the

remainder payable in cash (an “Interest Election”).

Following an Interest Election, interest due for the relevant interest period will be equal to an aggregate

amount of 9.00% and shall comprise the following elements: (i) 0.25% per annum cash-pay interest; and (ii)

8.75% per annum payment-in-kind interest (increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Notes or by

issuing additional New Notes, in each case, in a principal amount equal to an amount corresponding to an

interest rate of 8.75% per annum on 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes).

**Right to redeem the notes**

At any time prior to the second anniversary of the Restructuring Effective Time, the Issuer will be entitled,

at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal

amount of the Notes redeemed plus the applicable “make whole” premium described in the Notes

Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption. At any time prior

to the second anniversary of the Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo Group (i.e. October 9, 2023), the Company

will be entitled, at its option, during each calendar year, to redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal

amount of Notes at a redemption price equal to 103.8875% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued

and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption.

At any time on or after the second anniversary of the Restructuring Effective Time, the Company will be

entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price as described in the Notes

Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption. In the event of

certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes.

**Mandatory repayment upon request in case of change of control**

Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes will have the right

to require the Company to repurchase such holders’ Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate

principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption.

Following certain public equity offerings by the Parent or any Parent Entity (as defined in the Notes


-----

Indenture), the Company will be required to use the net cash proceeds of the relevant public equity offering

to make an offer to redeem the Notes at the redemption prices described in the Notes Indenture.

**Pledge agreements – securitization of the Notes**

In accordance with the notes indenture, various pledge agreements between the banks and selected Group

companies have been entered into under which all or a significant portion of the group’s assets and shares

of consolidated subsidiaries were granted as security for the payment of the Bonds. The assets that serve as

collateral are shown in the subsequent table:

(EUR thousand) **2022** **2021**

Shares pledged 932,530 868,171

Pursuant to the security agreements under the Mangrove Finance Agreements, securities will be enforced

by the lenders upon occurrence of a so-called acceleration event. An acceleration event requires the

existence of a material event of default, which cannot be remedied. Material events of default are for

example non-payment of interest or principal, financial covenant is not satisfied or insolvency of Mangrove

LuxCo III S.à r.l. As of the reporting date and until the release of this report, no material event of default has

been occurred.

#### 6.10 Financial instruments

The following tables provide an overview of the composition of financial instruments as of

December 31, 2022 by class within the meaning of IFRS 7 as well as by measurement category.

Trade receivables´ measurement in accordance with IFRS 15 (Trade receivables) include primarily

capitalized contract costs, PoC-gross profit earned to date and less progress billings. Other financial assets

measured in accordance with other IFRS consist mainly of VAT tax receivables, other receivables from

tax authorities and prepaid expenses to third party.

The following financial instruments fall under the amortized cost category as these are “hold” to collect

contractual cash flows: trade receivables (not tendered), cash, other financial assets (e.g. other operating

receivables). Other financial investments are both held-to-collect and for sale. The remeasurement of the

investments has not revealed any significant changes to the book value. Financial investments designated

as fair value through profit and loss are managed assets on a fair value basis and the business model is

neither held-to-collect nor held-to-collect and for sale. Collection of contractual cash flows is incidental to

the objective of this model. This category includes mainly derivatives and embedded derivatives.

Financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, or for which a fair value is disclosed in the

notes to the consolidated financial statements, are required to be categorized according to the fair value

hierarchy described in the following.

Categorization within the levels of the fair value hierarchy is based on the measurement of the underlying

inputs:

Level 1 inputs: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial assets and liabilities.

Level 2 inputs: quoted market prices that are observable as direct (prices) or indirect (derived from prices)

inputs used to measure fair value and that are not quoted prices as defined by Level 1.

Level 3 inputs: inputs that are not based on observable market data.

The following table shows the categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities into the three-level

fair value hierarchy.

**325,099** **-** **-** **325,099**

Trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and liabilities have short remaining

maturities in general. As a result, their fair values correspond to the carrying amounts.

Regarding Tracking preferred equity certificates / shareholder loan we refer to Note 6.2.

The carrying amount of the trade payables and other current liabilities that are subject to the measurement

rules of IFRS 9 corresponds to their fair value. The fair value of fixed-interest liabilities is the present value

of their expected future cash flows. They are discounted at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. The

carrying amount of variable-rate liabilities corresponds to their fair value.

The fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives are calculated using quoted exchange rates and yield

curves observable in the market. Accordingly, they are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of senior secured notes is categorized within Level 1. Fair Value is calculated according to its

quoted (unadjusted) price in active market.

The fair value of other financial assets of shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other equity

investments is measured on the basis of available financial information, such as transaction prices for

financing rounds or business plans to the extent that this information is reliable, or, as an approximation, as

cost, which is considered an appropriate estimate of fair value as no more suitable information is available.

A review is carried out on a quarterly basis using all information available on the equity investments to

establish whether cost is still representative of fair value. This would not be the case, for example, in the

event of a significant change in the market in which the equity investments are active. As cost is the sole

input factor for fair value, a percentage change in cost results in an equal change in fair value. The estimated

fair value would increase (decrease) with any increase (decrease) in cost. A 1% increase (decrease) would

not materially affect fair value. Accordingly, they are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The fair value of currency forwards at the reporting date is calculated on the basis of the spot exchange rate,

taking into account forward premiums and discounts corresponding to the relevant remaining maturities.

Forward premiums and discounts are derived from yield curves observable at the reporting date. The fair

value of currency options is calculated on the basis of recognized measurement models. Fair value is affected

by the remaining term of the option, the current exchange rate, the volatility of the exchange rate, and the

underlying yield curves.

Mangrove Group uses currency forwards as derivative financial instruments to hedge economically foreign

currency risk for existing or planned underlying transactions.

The following table presents the notional values and fair values of the derivative financial instruments in use

as of the reporting date. The notional value in foreign currency is translated at the closing rate.

The carrying amounts for the derivatives presented in the balance sheet are gross amounts.

Mangrove Group enters into derivative transactions under netting agreements with banks under the

German Master Agreement for Financial Derivatives Transactions. In general, under such agreements, the

amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same

currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other, in certain

circumstances – e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs - all outstanding transactions under the

agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in

settlement of all transactions. The potential offsetting volume is insignificant.

**Income and expenses**

The measurement effects from financial instruments have been recognized in profit or loss. The following

from construction contracts that had not been invoiced as of the reporting date. Amounts recognized

as contract assets are reclassified to trade receivables as the group obtains an unconditional right to the

payment.

Contract liabilities are essentially advance payments from customers for the construction of customer
specific plant and equipment for which revenues are realized over time.

amounting to EUR 12,521 thousand (2021: EUR 13,428 thousand). Impairment losses in 2022 amounting to

EUR 3,144 thousand (2021: EUR 1,543 thousand). For further details we refer to note 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

#### 7.6 Other interest income and interest expenses

**Interest income**

Interest and similar income are composed of the following items:

(EUR thousand) **2022** **2021**

**Interest income on receivables, cash investments, and marketable securities** **250** **6,546**

of which third parties 203 4,143

**Other interest income** **146** **111**

of which third parties **146** 111

**Total** **396** **6,657**

Interest income on receivables, cash investments, and marketable securities from third parties in 2021

mainly came as a result of the arbitration award of Kelvion’s Medupi project. Interest payments on all

amounts awarded by the tribunal of EUR 4,039 thousand had been received.

The following table shows the interest income on financial instruments broken down by the IFRS 9

measurement category “Debt instrument” (i.e. loan and receivables measured as amortized costs, excl.

factoring), along with the interest income on assets measured in accordance with other pronouncements:

thousand (2021: EUR 33,565 thousand), on PECs EUR 11,351 thousand (2021: EUR 11,351 thousand), on

liabilities to banks EUR 5,837 thousand (2021: EUR 6,956 thousand) and on the revolving credit facility EUR

2,254 thousand (2021: EUR 32 thousand). Interests on liabilities to banks mainly result from guarantee

commissions EUR 5,052 thousand (2021: EUR 6,085 thousand).

The following table shows the interest expenses on financial instruments broken down by the IFRS 9

measurement category “Debt instrument” (i.e. financial liabilities measured as amortized costs), along with

the interest expenses on liabilities measured in accordance with other pronouncements:

(EUR thousand) **2022** **2021**

**Total** **56,072** **58,384**

Interest expenses for financial liabilities not measured in accordance with IFRS 9 mainly refer to

compounding for provisions and pension obligations.

Interest income generated on advance payments and progress payments received reduces the cost of the

asset.

#### 7.7 Taxes on income

The income tax expense is calculated on the basis of Mangrove Group’s structure as of December 31, 2022.

The income tax expense referred to continuing operations is composed of the following items:

(EUR thousand) **2022** **2021**

**Current taxes** -11,019 -12,561

  - thereof: Luxembourg   - 606

  - thereof: Other countries -11,019 -13,167

Deferred taxes 23,586 -6,268

**Total** **12,567** **-18.829**

The expected tax expense for the entire Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. Group (including discontinued

operations) is calculated using the tax rate of 24.94 percent (2021: 24.94 percent) which is the applicable

corporate income tax rate in Luxembourg.


-----

The amount of deferred tax expense (income) relating to the origination and reversal of temporary

differences amounting to EUR 22,787 thousand.

In 2022, EUR 2,883 thousand deferred tax expense (2021: EUR 735 thousand deferred tax income) have

been recognized directly in other comprehensive income (OCI). The deferred taxes from OCI relate only to

pensions.

The following table shows a reconciliation from the expected income tax (by multiplying the earnings

before taxes with the nominal corporate income tax rate applicable in Luxembourg) to the effective

income taxes recognized in profit or loss:

**2022** **2021**

(EUR (EUR

**Income tax expense (-)/income (+) and effective tax rate** **12,567** **-25.88** **-18,829** **86.63**

Income tax income and effective tax rate on continuing operations 12,567 -25.88 -18,829 86.63

Non-tax-deductible expenses refer mainly to the non-deductible interest expense on the level of

Kelvion Finance GmbH and Mangrove GermanCo II GmbH.

The foreign tax rate differences are due to different tax rates outside Luxembourg, which vary from

between 0.00 percent (UAE) and 34.00 percent (Brazil) (2021: 0.00 percent (UAE) and 34.00 percent

(Brazil)).

The tax income driven by tax rate changes mainly relate to the increase of the tax rate for state tax of

an American legal entity which led to a higher DTA amount of EUR 3.899 thousand and the decrease

of the tax rate for Corporate Income Tax for a Chinese legal entity which led to reduction of DTA of EUR

1.068 thousand.

Taxes relating to other periods amounting to EUR 5,964 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,973 thousand)

comprise current taxes and deferred taxes for previous years. It mainly relates to America (EUR 1,486

thousand) and France (EUR 3,126 thousand).

The change in the valuation allowance of EUR 7,893 thousand (prior year: EUR -5,037 thousand) is

mainly based on a reassessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards.

Due to the positive forecast for future business development, it is assumed that the usability of tax loss

carryforwards will increase, particularly in the USA (EUR 5,049 thousand) and France (EUR 2,676

thousand).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets

against current tax liabilities and if the deferred taxes relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation

authority.

Deferred tax assets include an amount of EUR 9,498 thousand recognized at the US subsidiaries. Of this
amount, EUR 5,049 thousand relates to the utilization of deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards. In
addition, deferred tax assets of EUR 2,881 thousand were recognized at a French subsidiary, of which EUR
2,676 thousand relates to the utilization of deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards. Neither subsidiary
generated any tax losses in the financial year 2022.

In addition, deferred tax assets include an amount of EUR 5,515 thousand recognized for companies in the
fiscal unity of Mangrove GermanCo II GmbH. Of this amount, EUR 259 thousand relates to the utilization of
deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards. In the fiscal year 2022, the fiscal unity generated a tax loss.

In all cases mentioned, a positive business development is assumed in the future, so that the tax assets

recognized as of December 31, 2022 are realizable using the estimated future taxable income

The amount and the expiry period of corporate income tax losses (without discontinued operations) are

illustrated as follows:


-----

(EUR thousand) **2022** **2021**

Indefinite carryforward 650,922 668,206

**Total tax losses carried forward** **680,118** **709,803**

As of December 31, 2022, no deferred tax assets were recognized for corporate income tax loss

carryforwards in the amount of EUR 623,169 thousand (2021: EUR 691,638 thousand), thereof interest

carryforward in the amount of EUR 152,954 thousand (2021: EUR 100,462 thousand), as their utilization is

not sufficiently certain.

As of December 31, 2022, no deferred assets were recognized on deductible temporary differences in the
amount of 51,777 thousand Euro (2021: 29,428 thousand Euro).

## 8. Lease

A lease is an agreement that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a defined period

of time in return for a number of payments. The Group is a lessee mainly of land and buildings, machinery,

transportation and technical equipment.

**Lease accounting since October 9, 2019**

With the adoption of IFRS 16, the lessee is no longer required to differentiate between operating and finance

leases. As lessee, Mangrove now accounts for nearly all leases, recognizing right-of-use assets for leased

assets and liabilities for lease agreements. The following principles are considered:

    - Mangrove exercises the exemption for lease agreements with a maximum term of 12 months

from the date of provision and low-value assets. Low-value assets are generally defined as leased

with aggregated payments of EUR 20,000 or less.

    - Mangrove separates non-lease components, such as services, from lease payments.

    - Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments. Lease

payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readily be determined.

Otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate,

which is mainly applied, is based on risk-adjusted interest rates and determined for the respective

lease terms and currencies.

    - A right-of-use asset is initially recognized at the same amount as the lease liability. Differences

may arise from lease payments before commencement date and initial direct costs.

    - After capitalization at commencement date, the right-of use asset is measured at cost and

depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method.

    - Extension and termination options are part of a number of leases particularly of real estate.

Extension and termination options are taken into account on recognition of the lease liability only

if it is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future. When contract terms

are being determined, consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that offer an

economic incentive for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options.

Changes in lease terms arising from the exercise of an extension option or non-exercise of a


-----

termination option are only considered when determining lease terms if sufficient certainty

exists. Estimates and expectations which are asserted at the commencement date of the lease

liability and the right-of-use asset and pertain to future payments not yet determined on the date

of provision are assessed continuously during the lease term. If subsequently improved or

changed knowledge influences the expected payment profile over time, the lease liability is

remeasured.

The following right-of-use assets are recognized under other intangible assets:


**Carrying**
**amount Dec.**

## 9. Contingent liabilities, other financial obligations, and
 litigation

#### 9.1 Contingent liabilities

A Contingent liability is according to IAS 37.10 a “possible obligation that arises from past events and

whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain

future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or a present obligation that arises from past

events but is not recognized because:

###### (i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle

the obligation; or

###### (ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.”, i.e. uncertainties for

which the outcome has not been determined. If the occurrence is probable and the outcome can be

estimated reliable, a liability is recorded in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, Mangrove

Group has a recognized contingent liability relating to the SSNs which amounts to EUR 26,412 thousand

(2021: EUR 34,165 thousand) as of December 31, 2022. This contingent liability was recognized via

purchase price allocation..

Several companies of Mangrove Group have issued or instructed the issuance of bank guarantees in favor

of customers or lenders. These bank guarantees are not considered to be contingent liabilities because these

guarantees are linked to a performance obligation to be rendered by Mangrove Group.

#### 9.2 Other financial obligations

Other financial obligations as of December 31, 2022 related to purchase commitments and bank guarantees.

**Purchase commitments**

Purchase commitments as of December 31, 2022 can be broken down as follows:


**Purchase commitments**


(EUR thousand) **12/31/2022** **12/31/2021**

Inventories 129,717 167,477

Intangible assets 1,984 92

Tangible assets 3,661 6,904

**Group Total** 135,362 174,473

**Bank Guarantees**

Mangrove Holding Group companies utilized bank guarantees in the amount of EUR 157.7 million (as of

December 31, 2021: EUR 137.6 million). The major part of the lines is granted by a bank consortium (total

line EUR 190 million, thereof EUR 134.2 million utilized).

The obligation presented in the following table relates to contingent liabilities for which primary debtors in

the underlying transactions (e.g. deliveries) are non-consolidated Mangrove Group companies, and for

which bank guarantees were utilized in favor of customers.

**Group Total** **4,855** **3,975**

#### 9.3 Litigation

A number of claims have been brought arising out of the financial restructuring as described below (the

“Restructuring”). However, as with any dispute, the outcome of these proceedings cannot be guaranteed.

In the opinion of Management, the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims will not materially affect

the consolidated financial position of the Group, but it might be possible that the conclusion of such

proceedings may result in future income or expenses if the amounts that have been accrued for them are

higher or lower than required.

On October 9, 2019, Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. acquired the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. as described

elsewhere in these notes (e.g. chapter “1.2 Acquisition of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries and

successful Refinancing on October 9, 2019”), associated preferred equity certificates and any intercompany

payables owed by Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to its former parent company Galapagos S.A. The acquisition was

made in connection with the Restructuring, which was completed on October 9, 2019.

A number of sets of internationally recognized advisors were involved in the Restructuring and management

believes that the Restructuring was fully legally effective and complied with all obligations, including under

the applicable finance documents.

The following claims have been brought which arise out of the Restructuring:

   - Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. has commenced proceedings in England against inter alios the Security

Trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement which effected the Restructuring, the trustee which

held rights on behalf of the Galapagos Senior Notes and each of the plaintiffs in the New York,

German and Luxembourg proceedings described below, requesting that the English Court makes

a series of declarations inter alia that the Restructuring complied with the terms of the

Intercreditor Agreement. The English proceedings do not contain any claim for damages. A

challenge to the jurisdiction of the English Court to hear this claim was lodged by two of the

defendants in these proceedings and was heard in December 2020. This challenge was dismissed

by the English Court on 19 January 2021. The trial commenced on 9 March and concluded on 23

March. A judgment is expected before summer 2023.

   - A claim in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a beneficial holder of the Galapagos
Senior Notes (“NY Claimant”) against inter alios Galapagos Holding (former indirect parent of
Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) and certain of its subsidiaries (now being subsidiaries of Mangrove
Group) relating to the Restructuring. The plaintiff alleges that the Restructuring wrongly deprived
it of value by diverting assets away from the Group and releasing certain guarantees. The plaintiff
seeks: (i) damages; and (ii) a reversal of the steps taken to affect the Restructuring. In addition,
the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the release of liabilities under the Galapagos Senior Notes
Indenture pursuant to the provisions of the former Intercreditor Agreement applying to certain
liabilities of the Group was invalid (in other words, that this part of the Restructuring also be
reversed). The Supreme Court of the State of New York decided on 22 July 2020 to stay this action
pending a decision from the English Court as to its jurisdiction in these matters (as referred to


-----

above). The plaintiff indicated that it intended to appeal this decision, but no substantive appeal
was actually served. Following the decision by the English Court on 19 January 2021, the
proceedings in New York are still stayed.

   - On October 31, 2019 main insolvency proceedings were opened over the assets of Galapagos
S.A. in Düsseldorf, Germany. Two appeals were lodged at the German Federal Supreme Court on
the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf insolvency court. Following such appeals, on December 17,
2020, the German Federal Court of Justice referred certain legal questions concerning matters of
European insolvency law (and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the Düsseldorf court in such
insolvency proceedings) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for determination. The
Court of Justice of the European Union rendered its decision on 24 March 2022, which confirmed
that the German courts did not have authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019,
given that the European regime applied to the UK at this time. Following this decision, on 30 June
2022 the English insolvency court made a winding-up order with regard to Galapagos S.A., and
has therefore asserted its jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings (after it had stayed the
insolvency proceedings in England in August 2019 due to the court in Düsseldorf, Germany,
claiming its jurisdiction). The German Federal Court of Justice rendered its decision (based on the
Court of Justice of the European Union decision) on 8 December 2022, declaring that since the
English courts did not make their winding-up order prior to the Brexit transition period, i.e. 31
December 2020 such that the German courts are no longer bound by the EU Insolvency
regulation when considering proceedings opened in England, the German courts had
retrospective authority to appoint the administrator on 23 August 2019,. Thus, the German
insolvency proceedings remain in place, alongside the competing equivalent English proceedings.

   - The purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., Luxembourg (former 100 percent shareholder of
Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l.) has brought a claim against Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos
BidCo S.à r.l. in Luxembourg detailing his allegations that the Restructuring (i.e. the refinancing
of Galapagos Group and the sale of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. to Mangrove Group) involved a
fraudulent exercise of a Luxembourg share pledge and that it should, therefore, be unwound.
However, no steps have been taken by the administrator to progress this claw back action. In
addition to the main claim, following the administrator’s application the Luxembourg Court
granted an ex parte “preservation order” whereby a trustee was appointed to prevent an actual
or de facto liquidation of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This escrow order has been successfully
appealed and set aside by the Luxembourg Court. This decision was then appealed by the
administrator, but this appeal was rejected by the Court. A further appeal was then made by the
administrator to the Luxembourg Cour de cassation which overturned the Court of Appeal’s
decision to set aside the escrow order on the basis that share pledge enforcements cannot be
challenged under Luxembourg law. The matter was referred back to the Luxembourg Court to
consider the position on the merits. The Luxembourg Court of Appeal decided that the
administrator had not demonstrated that any fraudulent action took place and it therefore
dismissed the appeal. The consequence of these various actions is that there is no escrow order
in place. Finally, the administrator has brought a separate action challenging the 2021
restructuring of the assets of Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This action raises similar allegations to those
made in the claw back action. The Luxembourg Court has yet to order a timetable for Mangrove
LuxCo IV S.à r.l. and Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l’ to file their defence.

   - Following an application of the purported administrator of Galapagos S.A., the District Court of
Düsseldorf, Germany, had issued an injunction (einstweilige Verfügung) against Mangrove LuxCo
IV S.à r.l., ordering an escrow agent to hold the shares in Galapagos BidCo S.à r.l. This order was
successfully appealed and, consequently, the injunction was lifted in June 2021. Further, by the
same plaintiff, a main proceeding (Hauptsacheverfahren) has been initiated against inter alios
Mangrove LuxCo IV S.à r.l. A first hearing took place in February 2023 with a decision announced
for May 2023.

Based on legal advice of leading international law firms based in the UK, Luxembourg, Germany and the US


-----

(privilege in respect of which is not waived) Management assesses the risk from the above-mentioned

ongoing litigation as well as future litigation as follows: 1) The risk that the Restructuring would be unwound

is considered remote; and 2) The risk of having to pay damages to former holders of the Galapagos Senior

Notes or any other third party is considered unlikely.

In the unlikely event of successful damage claims against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the RCF

Facility Agreement, the SGF Facility Agreement, the Cash Cover Loan Facility Agreement and the Mangrove

Notes Indenture will permit the Group to incur up to EUR 100 million of new indebtedness only for these

purposes which will rank senior to the Mangrove Senior Notes. Therefore, Management is confident to be

able to fund such claims from new indebtedness and/or cash available.

## 10.Other disclosures

#### 10.1 Consolidated cash flow statement disclosures from

 continuing operations

**Cash flow from operating activities – continuing operations – increased from EUR 30.1 million in 2021 to**

EUR 80.2 million in fiscal year 2022. This cash-flow is driven by an EBITDA of EUR 64.5 million and a EUR 25.1

million lower trade working capital. These positive impacts are partially offset by tax payments of EUR 8.3

million.

**Cash flow from investing activities – continuing operations – increased from EUR -29.5 million in 2021 to**

EUR -33.5 million in 2022 which shows high investment activity on the level of 2021. The cash out in 2022

relates to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as to intangible assets of EUR -34.8

million. The proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets and assets held for sale amount to EUR 1.3

million.

**Cash flow from financing activities – continuing operations – decreased from EUR -22.2 million in 2021 to**

EUR -6.4 million. In the current year, the financing cash flow primarily consists of interest payments (EUR 
41.7 million, FY 2021: EUR -18.1 million), payments from finance lease (EUR -12.7 million, FY 2021: EUR 
20.0 million), as well as proceeds from revolving credit facility (EUR 50.0 million, FY 2021: EUR 15.0 million).

The higher interest payments in FY2022 relate to the deferral of the payment of interest on the Senior

Secured Notes in December 2021 (EUR 14.2 million) and lower interest on the Senior Guarantee Facility.

The reconciliation of movements of liabilities to cash flows arising from financing activities is presented in

The remuneration of the key operating management of Mangrove Group is composed of the following

components:

(EUR thousand) **2022** **2021**

Short term 2,509 2,280

Termination benefits  - 599

Post-employment benefits 58  
Share-based payments  -  
**Total** **2,567** **2,879**

The remuneration of former members of the key operating management amounts to EUR 0 thousand (2021:

EUR 0 thousand).

For more details regarding the share-based payments we refer to Note 10.5

#### 10.5 Share based payments

In 2020 certain management personnel (“co-investors”) were invited to participate in the Mangrove Group’s
Management Incentive Plan (“Mangrove MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of
Mangrove Management Invest S.C.A; an entity which has a part-ownership of Mangrove LuxCo II S.à r.l., the
parent company of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l.. In order to participate in the MIP, an initial cash investment
was required from the co-investors, which was at not less than the fair value of the investments.

During the year 2022 an additional Management Incentive Plan was launched. Again, certain management
personnel were invited to participate in the new Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group’s Management Incentive
Plan (“KTS MIP”). This investment takes the form of part-ownership of TESCO Management S.C.A; an entity
which has a minority of TES LuxCo S.à r.l.. TES LuxCo S.à r.l. is the parent company of the Mangrove´s business
unit Kelvion Thermal Solutions Group. Similar to the first MIP (“Mangrove MIP”) launched in 2020, the
investment is structured in a way that the co-investors are taking a part ownership of a holding company via
an investment vehicle. In order to participate in the KTS MIP, in a first step the co-investors sold their
contribution in the Mangrove MIP at fair value to Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.. In the amount of this receivable
from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l., the co-investors received an investment in the new KTS MIP. The initial cash
related investment of the co-investors (receivable from Mangrove LuxCo I S.à r.l.) in KTS MIP was not less
than to the fair value of the investment in any case.

The nature of both schemes is such that co-investors’ investments will only be realised upon “exit” of the
Group’s current shareholders, with exception of specific events (for example co-investors leaving the
employment of the Group). It is anticipated that co-investors will participate in the MIPs until such exit is
achieved. The lead investor is permitted to issue further equity, and each co-investor has the explicit right
to participate further in the MIPs, such that their investment is not diluted.

In the context of IFRS 2, both MIPs are considered to be equity-settled share-based payment arrangements.

#### 10.6 Company bodies

The board members of Mangrove LuxCo III S.à r.l. are:

Matthew Crill

Joakim Lindström-Formicola

#### 10.7 Shareholder committees

CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the
audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent
of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants,
including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards
Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial
statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**_Other information_**

The Board of Managers is responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises the information stated in the consolidated report including the consolidated
management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report
of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” thereon.


-----

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information
and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**_Responsibilities of the Board of Managers for the consolidated financial statements_**

The Board of Managers is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Managers determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Managers is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
Board of Managers either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.

**_Responsibilities of the réviseur d'entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated_**
**_financial statements_**

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.


-----

— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Managers.

— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Managers' use of the going concern basis
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
date of our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé”. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

**_Report on other legal and regulatory requirements_**

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements
and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
