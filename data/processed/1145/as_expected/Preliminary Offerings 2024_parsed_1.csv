Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 has been extracted from the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP; however, management believes that certain non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. These include certain operating measures such as AMPs. These also include certain financial measures such as EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA, Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA, Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin and Stakes. The primary non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are defined below: - “EBITDA” is defined as net loss before income taxes, interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization; - “EBITDA Margin” is defined as EBITDA divided by revenue for the relevant period; - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA before other (expense)/income, net, transaction fees and associated costs, restructuring and integration costs, legal settlements/(loss contingencies), gaming tax expenses and impairment; - “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the relevant period; - “Further Adjusted EBITDA” defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding share-based compensation charge; - “Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Further Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the relevant period; - “Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is our segment measure of profit or loss excluding share-based compensation charge; - “Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue; - “Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Group Adjusted EBITDA excluding US Segment Adjusted EBITDA; - “Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA excluding share-based compensation charge; ix ----- - **Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue; - “Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue; - “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” is defined as net cash provided by operating activities _excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities related to player deposits, investment and player deposit liabilities, cash paid for transaction fees and associated costs, restructuring fees and integration costs, legal settlement/loss contingencies and includes the cash impact of purchases of property and equipment, purchases of intangible assets and capitalized software; - “Net Debt” is defined as total debt, excluding premiums, discounts, and deferred financing expense, and the effect of foreign exchange that is economically hedged as a result of our cross-currency interest rate swaps reflecting the net cash outflow on maturity less cash and cash equivalents. - “Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin” is defined as revenue from our sportsbook operations divided by Stakes for the period; and - “Stakes” is defined as the total amount our players wagered in sportsbook during the period. We present these non-GAAP measures in this Offering Memorandum because we believe that they provide useful information regarding the Company’s ability to service and incur indebtedness and our management uses them as a measure of evaluating our operating performance. These non-GAAP measures are not measurements of operating performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operating activities or other profit and loss account or statement of cash flows information, or as a measure of profitability or liquidity, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements. Therefore, the non-GAAP measures presented in this Offering Memorandum should be viewed as supplementary to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor are they meant to be predictive of potential future results. Because all companies do not calculate such measures identically, the presentation may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such financial information. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and not rely on a single financial measure to evaluate our business. We also strongly urge you to review the reconciliations between our most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP measures and our non-GAAP measures set forth in “Summary—Summary Financial Information.” These non-GAAP measures have further limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes the Group may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s statements of cash flows; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - the further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are those that management consider not to be representative of the underlying operations of the Group and therefore are subjective in nature; and - other companies in the industry may calculate these measures differently than the Group does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. x ----- For a discussion of our financial information, see “Summary—Summary Financial Information,” “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Conditions and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this_ Offering Memorandum. We present in this Offering Memorandum certain as adjusted financial data which is based on our consolidated financial information as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on December 31, 2023 (in the case of consolidated balance sheet information), or January 1, 2023 (in the case of consolidated statement of comprehensive income information), including the application of proceeds from the offering of the Notes as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.” The as adjusted financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the related adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial data have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. Certain amounts and percentages set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information presented in billions, millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been rounded. Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column of a table may not exactly equal the total figure for that column. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other information set out in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations” are calculated using the unrounded numerical data in the financial statements or the tabular_ presentation of other information contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof. The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Our U.S. division saw its market share reach 37%, including an online sportsbook market share based on gross gaming revenue from online sportsbook of 43.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, or 53.4% based on net gaming revenue (based on data received from reporting states only). This leading market position was driven by efficient customer acquisition and retention, high-quality products and effective execution of our strategies, and it has enabled us to fully capitalize on our significant opportunity in the United States, as evidenced by our delivery of a positive US Adjusted EBITDA ($65 million) as well as positive US Further Adjusted EBITDA ($167 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Outside of the United States, we estimate that the total betting and gaming market was worth $384 billion in 2023, with 30% of this market occurring online. We also estimate that, of the $339 billion TAM outside of the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, $172 billion occurred in regulating or regulated markets, representing a significant opportunity for further growth internationally. We believe our scale and market leading positions in our online betting and gaming markets will enable us to (i) proactively prepare for new market openings and capture and consolidate market share, (ii) continue to benefit from the shift from in person to online betting and gaming and (iii) operate a resilient business model which we believe has allowed us to continue growing through regulatory changes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

We believe our scale provides us with a key advantage over competitors and has contributed to leading positions in our key markets. We held a leading 37% market share (including an online sportsbook market share of 43.2% and an iGaming market share of 25.7%) in the United States for the three months ended December 31, 2023, while our U.S. division revenue grew 40.7% between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.

In Australia, Sportsbet enjoyed a leading position, holding an estimated online market share of 45% based on gross gaming revenue from online sports betting and gaming in the year ended December 31, 2023. Throughout our International division, our brands held a range of top-three positions across various geographic markets for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our leading brands, which are among the most recognizable in their markets, include: FanDuel, Sky Betting & Gaming, Sportsbet, PokerStars, Paddy Power, Sisal, tombola, MaxBet, Betfair, TVG, Junglee Games and Adjarabet. The acquisition of Sisal in August 2022 has further improved our broad and geographically diverse offering, increasing our exposure in Italy, which is Europe’s largest regulated gaming market. Additionally, the acquisition of MaxBet in January 2024 added a local hero brand to our portfolio in Serbia, a fast growing regulated market. We believe the diversified nature of our brand portfolio, product mix and geographic footprint has historically delivered a resilient business model and positions us well to capitalize on future growth opportunities. 2 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

We believe that the availability of this company-wide expertise, as and when our brands need it, provides us with a distinctive set of advantages. We devote substantial resources to delivering the best products to our customers. We devote significant capital expenditures in developing and maintaining our proprietary technology as well as to the employment of approximately 7,000 technologists, including approximately 3,200 software engineers, around the Group to which our brands have access. The benefits of our multi-decade investment are available to all our brands, ensuring we are driving market trends and strengthening our compelling customer proposition across the Group, while delivering the benefits of our global scale across each of our local brands. We believe that the market-leading pricing and risk management capabilities underpinning our sportsbook product innovations for each of our sportsbook businesses showcase the benefits of our investment in technology. For example, we first launched the “Same Game Multi” product in Australia and subsequently launched it in other markets around the globe, including as “Same Game Parlay” in the United States. We believe that our investment in technology underlies our competitive advantage in gaming as well. Our four in-house studios provide access to proprietary gaming content which is delivered across the Group to our gaming brands. We have also successfully utilized innovation in our UKI business to drive player engagement, including daily prize mechanics such as Sky Betting & Gaming’s “Prize Machine” and Paddy Power’s “Wonder Wheel.” These innovations have helped to drive gaming momentum, and we have deployed these successes in our other businesses as well, as demonstrated by the launch of the PokerStars “Spin of the Day” mechanic in 2022 and FanDuel’s Reward Machine in 2023. We share access to people and talent across our Group, ensuring our businesses utilize the sector expertise we have built over decades across our diverse portfolio of brands and products. We are led by an experienced, entrepreneurial management team committed to realizing our Group strategy. Our management team is highly qualified and has a track record of navigating regulatory changes while continuing to grow our business. Our management team has demonstrated success with integrating mergers and acquisitions into the existing Group and in realizing synergies created by these acquisitions. The numerous significant mergers and acquisitions that our management team has led us through in our recent history include the acquisitions of Sisal, tombola, MaxBet, Adjarabet and Junglee.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

For example, by setting a clearly defined strategy for success in the United States and effectively executing that strategy, we have developed a profitable business model with revenue generated by existing players funding the cost of player acquisitions and operating expenses, leading to a US Adjusted EBITDA of $65 million and US Further Adjusted EBITDA of $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Group outside of the U.S. division experienced revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA growth. Revenue outside the United States grew 16%, Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.5% and Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA grew 10% year over year between December 31, 2022 and 2023, driven by the acquisition of Sisal, strong AMP growth, enhanced product and generosity initiatives. This was partly offset by lower Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA in Australia due to COVID-19 spend reversion, a softer racing market in Australia, and the annualized impact of increased point of consumption tax rate in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA growth over the same period was also driven by the “Consolidate and Invest” markets within our International division where we aim to build and maintain our leadership positions (including Italy, Spain, Georgia, Armenia, Brazil, India, and Turkey), where revenue grew 14% and Sisal online revenue grew 20% on a pro 3 ----- forma basis to include the Sisal acquisition as if Sisal had been acquired as of January 1, 2022. Group ExUS Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased by 1.7 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively, year over year between December 31, 2022 and 2023, primarily driven by the Australian trends noted above. We also believe that our financial profile showcases a commitment to a disciplined financial policy that is supported by a cash-generative model that we believe to be highly attractive. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated $937 million net cash provided by operating activities (2022: $1,163 million) and $938 million of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, 1.6 times our Adjusted Free Cash Flow generated in the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of strong EBITDA growth, positive working capital movements and, low capital intensity. Our U.S. business generated positive Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2023, and we believe the ongoing deleveraging impact of the growing U.S. business positions us well to achieve our medium-term leverage goals.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Devised and driven by our employees, our Positive Impact Plan creates a consistent global approach that aligns with our corporate strategy and gives our diverse portfolio of brands better access to the insights, skills and capabilities of the wider Group in order to develop and deliver local initiatives that create maximum impact. The plan focuses on three key areas of sustainability for the future, with clear long-term goals to: - Help customers Play Well: our goal is to increase the proportion of our online customers that use at least one of our safer gambling tools. As of December 31, 2023, 44.9% of our active online customers were already utilizing our safer gambling tools, increasing from 40.8% as of December 31, 2022. - Empower colleagues to Work Better: Our goal is for our teams to be representative of the places in which we live and work, through a comprehensive diversity and inclusion strategy. As of December 31, 2023, 35.7% of leadership roles at Flutter were held by women. - Work with communities to Do More: our goal is to improve the lives of millions of people through various community support initiatives by using the power of sport and play, the skills of our colleagues and the reach of our brands. While we are actively focused on our three key focus areas, we also recognize the important role we play as a large, multi-national operator to be an industry leader in promoting environmental responsibility. In support of our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint, our Positive Impact Plan also sets environmental goals that include following our roadmap to achieving our net zero ambitions via science-based carbon targets, developing and implementing a global e-waste policy across our divisions and suppliers in the near term and aiming to move all of our energy tariffs, where possible, to renewable energy tariffs over the medium term.

The first part of our U.S. strategy is to extend our number one position in online sportsbook. Since the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (“PASPA”) and the associated start of gambling market liberalization in the United States in 2018, FanDuel has generally been the number one brand in the U.S. market. FanDuel finished the year ended December 31, 2023 with a 43% online sports betting market share, while generating $4.4 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that we will be able to continue to deliver leadership in the U.S. market through the _FanDuel Advantage where we believe that FanDuel is (i) able to acquire players efficiently, (ii) retain players for longer and (iii) earn higher average revenue per player. The second component of our U.S. investment strategy is to utilize our portfolio of assets and our expertise to grow our gaming proposition.

By retaining our challenger mindset and continuing to invest in our brand and product propositions, we intend to extend our leadership position and grow our recreational customer base efficiently, leveraging local scale to unlock benefits across these markets. Our Australia and UKI divisions experienced strong recreational customer growth in the year ended December 31, 2023, with AMPs having increased a combined 9% between the two divisions compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe our scale will position us well to invest in our brand and product leadership to continue to deliver best-in-class experiences to our customers. To build upon the momentum we generated from previous market leading product innovations, such as our Sportsbet “Same Game Multi” and daily prize mechanics, such as the Sky Vegas “Prize Machine,” we intend to continue to invest in our products in order to deliver the next generation of product advantages. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our scale and product leadership enabled us to maintain our gold medal positions in our core markets, including a 2 percentage point increase in our UKI market share. For example, our UKI division launched “Live Casino” products and Sky Bet’s “AccaFreeze” during the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, the acquisition of Sisal in August 2022 has provided us with another gold medal position in Italy, one of the world’s largest regulated markets.

By utilizing these leadership advantages, we intend to extend our leadership positions internationally through building and buying businesses that occupy top-three market positions in regulated markets to maximize the network benefits of our products. We have identified four key areas to bolster our framework for future growth: - By deploying our resources and capital, we intend to consolidate our number-one positions in our largest markets, such as in Italy following our acquisition of Sisal, thereby driving profitable growth. - We intend to invest for leadership in fast-growing markets, such as India, Brazil, and Turkey, where we have been generating strong returns on incremental product and marketing investments. - We intend to optimize our returns from other regulated markets, mainly across Europe, based on our current market position or market growth outlook. 5 ----- - Maintain our presence in other regulated and regulating markets which are generating positive contribution and/or provide future growth optionality. - We also intend replicate the success we achieved with the acquisitions of Adjarabet and Junglee Games by identifying acquisition targets that are a strategic fit for us, establishing additional leadership positions among the top-three operators in attractive, fast-growing markets where organic growth is slower or more challenging to achieve. The acquisition of MaxBet, which holds a podium position in the attractive Serbian market, in January 2024, is the most recent example of this strategy in action. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to improve our revenue mix across both products and geographies.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement.”_ Security: ..................................** Pursuant to the Security Documents, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date, and in any event within 25 business days of the Issue Date, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors will, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, perfection requirements and any Permitted Liens, grant liens and security interests on an equal and ratable first-ranking basis, over the assets listed below: - the shares of the Issuer and in the case of any Guarantor incorporated or organized in any Security Jurisdiction outside of the United States, any shares or other ownership interests it owns in any other Guarantor and any shares or ownership interests it owns in a wholly owned Material Subsidiary (as defined herein) incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction (as defined herein); and - in the case of each Guarantor incorporated or organized in a state of the United States, all material assets located in the United States but excluding any real property, deposit accounts and any other bank accounts, any intercompany receivables arising directly or indirectly in connection with any cash management, cash pooling, treasury management, tax arrangements or any similar or equivalent arrangements, any ownership interests in a joint venture or other entity that is not a material subsidiary organized or incorporated in Alderney, Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Gibraltar, Ireland, Isle of Man, Malta, the Netherlands or incorporated in any state of the United States and certain other customary excluded property. 5 ----- (together, the “Collateral”). The security interests confirmed or supplemented under the Security Documents in relation to the Collateral in connection with this Offering of the Notes may be junior to the security interests created over the accessory Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents entered into prior to the Issue Date, under which prior security interests have also been granted in favor of, inter alios, the Security Agent for the benefit of the secured parties. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that such junior security interests will be treated as security interests ranking _pari passu with such prior security interests. However, if the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were voided or held to be unenforceable for any reason, Holders of the Notes would not benefit from such first-ranking treatment and would be subordinated, with respect to such security interests, to the prior security interests over the same Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” The Agreed Security Principles under the Credit Agreement require security to be granted over the shares of each of the companies that are obligors or wholly owned material subsidiaries incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction and otherwise require security on an equal and rateable basis with the Credit Facilities. A combination of these Agreed Security Principles will apply to the security granted in favor of the Notes. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of _Guarantees_ _and_ _Security_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law Considerations.”_ Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets will not be pledged (or the liens not perfected) and guarantees will not be required, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles as described under “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” The security over the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. The security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_ Intercreditor Agreement: ......** Each holder of a Note by accepting a Note will be deemed to have agreed to, and be bound by, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and the rights and benefits of the holders of the Notes will be limited accordingly and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement.”_ Optional Redemption: ...........** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after       , 2026, at the applicable redemption prices as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and 6 ----- additional amounts, if any, plus the relevant “make-whole” premium, as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to        % of the principal amount of the USD Notes and        % of the principal amount of the EUR Notes being redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, in each case, subject to conditions described under “Description of the Notes— _Optional Redemption.”_ At any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem during each 12-month period up to 10% of the aggregate principal outstanding amount of each series of Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” Withholding Taxes: ................** All payments in respect of the Notes or the Notes Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding tax is required by law in Ireland, any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or the Notes Guarantee is made or any other jurisdiction in which the Issuer or the Guarantors are incorporated or organized, resident or engaged in business for tax purposes or has a permanent establishment, in each case, including any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein in (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as appropriate, will pay additional amounts so that the net amount received will equal the amounts which would have received in the absence of such withholding. See “Description of the Notes— _Withholding Taxes.”_ Tax Redemption: ....................** If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable, the Issuer may redeem the Notes of any series in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.” Change of Control: ................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of all of the then outstanding Notes validly tender such Notes in the event of an offer following a change of control, and the Issuer, or any third party making such an offer purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option 7 ----- _of Holders—Change of Control.”_ Certain Covenants: ................** The Indenture will, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company, the Issuer and the other restricted subsidiaries of the Company to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or permit to exist certain liens; - merge or consolidate with other entities; and - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for so long as the Notes achieve investment grade ratings. See “Description of the _Notes—Certain_ _Covenants—Suspension_ _of_ _Covenants_ _on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” There can be no assurance_ that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

Economic recessions have had, and may continue to have, far reaching adverse consequences across many industries, including the global entertainment, betting and gaming industries, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, inflation has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure. The recent significant inflationary trends have had an adverse effect on our cost of labor expenditure, as well as other operating expenses. Moreover, our business is particularly sensitive to reductions from time to time in discretionary consumer spending, which is driven by socioeconomic factors beyond our control. Demand for entertainment and leisure activities, including betting and iGaming, can be affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes, both of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdowns, sustained high levels of unemployment and rising prices or the perception by consumers of weak or weakening economic conditions, may reduce our customers’ disposable income or result in fewer individuals engaging in entertainment and leisure activities, such as betting, iGaming or daily fantasy sports. As a result, we cannot ensure that the demand for our product offerings will remain consistent. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, including a general tightening of credit availability, decreased liquidity in certain financial markets, inflation, increased interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, increased energy costs, acts of war or terrorism, cyber-attacks, transportation disruptions, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, power loss, declining consumer confidence, sustained high levels of unemployment or significant declines in stock markets, as well as pandemics, epidemics, public health emergencies and the spread of contagious diseases, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19, could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on entertainment and leisure activities, such as betting and iGaming, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,Our business is exposed to competitive pressures given the international nature of competition in online betting and iGaming.,"If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers and we may not be able to attract new customers. The online betting and iGaming market is increasingly competitive. This competition takes place on an international level and operators around the world leverage that scale to attract customers to their websites, with the implication that the barriers to a customer switching between competing operators are low. We may be unable to respond quickly or adequately to changes in the industry brought on by new products and technologies, the availability of products on other technology platforms and marketing channels, and the introduction of new features and functionality or new marketing and promotional efforts by our existing competitors or new competitors and new technology. Such competitors may spend more money and time on developing and testing products and services, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing or promotional policies or otherwise develop more commercially successful products or services than ours, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our competitors may also develop products, features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance. 16 ----- In addition, we are also subject to the risk of further consolidation in the betting and gaming industry, which might result in the formation of a very large or successful competitor to whom we might lose market share. Other competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources than us in certain jurisdictions or markets in which we operate and they may be able to secure greater liquidity than us. A loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, betting and gaming faces competition from other entertainment and leisure activities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase or maintain our share of customers’ discretionary spending against such other entertainment and leisure activities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

A number of other online betting and iGaming companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active customer bases or levels of engagement decline. Our strategy is to increase customer engagement and retention, but there is no guarantee that we will not experience an erosion of our AMP base or engagement levels among customers in the future. Our customer engagement patterns have changed over time, and customer engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as customers continue to engage increasingly via mobile devices and as we introduce new and different product offerings. Any number of factors could negatively affect customer retention, growth and engagement, including if: - customers increasingly engage with our competitors’ products or services; - we fail to introduce, or delay the introduction of, new products or services (whether developed internally, licensed or otherwise obtained or developed in conjunction with third parties) that users find engaging or that work with a variety of operating systems or networks, or if we introduce new products or services, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience, or changes to our existing products or services, that are not favorably received by customers; - customers have difficulty installing, updating or otherwise accessing our products on desktops or mobile devices as a result of our actions or the actions of the third parties we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services; - there are decreases in customer sentiment about the quality of our products or concerns related to privacy, safety, security or other factors; - new industry standards are adopted or customers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, may not be featured or otherwise available, or may otherwise be rendered obsolete and unmarketable; - there are adverse changes in our products that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements; - we do not obtain applicable regulatory or other approvals or renewals of such approvals to offer, directly or indirectly, our products in new or existing jurisdictions; - technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the customer experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content; - we adopt policies or procedures related to areas such as customer data and information that are perceived negatively by our customers or the general public; - we elect to focus our customer growth and engagement efforts more on longer-term initiatives, or if initiatives designed to attract and retain customers and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of our actions or the actions of third parties or otherwise; 17 ----- - we fail to price our product offerings competitively or provide adequate customer service; - we or other companies in the online betting and iGaming industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity; or - we fail to effectively anticipate or respond to customers’ continuously changing and dynamic needs, demands and preferences, such as new casino games or poker variants, or innovative types of sports betting or betting related to new or popular sporting events, as well as emerging technological trends, or where our competitors more effectively anticipate or respond to the same. If we are unable to maintain or increase our customer base or engagement, or effectively monetize our customer base’s use of our products and product offerings, our revenue may be adversely affected. Any decrease in customer retention, growth or engagement, including player liquidity, could render our products less attractive to customers, which is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, if we fail to make the right investment decisions in our product offerings and technology, we may not attract and retain customers and our revenue and results of operations may decline.","The industries in which we operate are subject to rapid and frequent changes in standards, technologies, products and services, as well as in customer demands, expectations and regulations. We must continuously make decisions regarding which product offerings and technology we should invest in to meet customer demand in compliance with evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements, and must continually introduce and successfully market new and innovative technologies, product offerings and enhancements to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand, acceptance and engagement. Our ability to engage, retain and increase our customer base and to increase our revenue will depend heavily on our ability to successfully create new product offerings, both independently and together with third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing technology and product offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven products and services, with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. The process of developing new product offerings and systems is inherently complex and uncertain, and new product offerings may not be well received by customers, even if well-reviewed and of high quality. If we are unable to develop technology and product offerings that address customers’ needs or enhance and improve our existing technology and product offerings in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we intend to continue investing in our research and development efforts, if new or enhanced product offerings fail to engage our customers or partners, we may fail to attract or retain customers or generate sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments, any of which may seriously harm our business. In addition, management may not properly ascertain or assess the risks of new initiatives, and subsequent events may alter the risks that were evaluated at the time we decided to execute any new initiative. Developing and creating additional product offerings can also divert management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. Even if our new product offerings attain market acceptance, those new product offerings have in certain cases cannibalized, and in the future, could continue to cannibalize, the market share of our existing product offerings or share of our customers’ discretionary spending in a manner that could negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, such expansion of our business increases the complexity of our business and places an additional burden on our management, operations, technical systems and financial resources, and we may not recover the often-substantial up-front costs of developing and marketing new product offerings, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other potential new product offerings. In the event of continued growth of our operations, product offerings or in the number of thirdparty relationships, we may not have adequate resources, operationally, technologically or otherwise, to support such growth, and the quality of our technology, product offerings or our relationships with third parties could suffer. In addition, failure to effectively identify, pursue and execute new business initiatives, or to efficiently adapt our processes and infrastructure to meet the needs of our innovations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any new product offerings may also require our customers to utilize new skills to use our product offerings. This could create a lag in adoption of new product offerings and new customer additions related to any new product offerings. Further, we may develop new product offerings that increase customer engagement and 18 ----- costs without increasing revenue. Additionally, we may make bad or unprofitable decisions regarding these investments. If new or existing competitors offer more attractive product offerings, we may lose customers or customers may decrease their spending on our products. New customer demands, superior product offerings by competitors, new industry standards or changes in the regulatory environment could render our existing product offerings unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete, and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our technology or business model.

Adverse changes in laws, regulations or enforcement policies in any jurisdiction may make the provision of key services to us unlawful or otherwise problematic in such jurisdictions. To the extent that third-party suppliers are unwilling or unable to provide us with services, this may have a material adverse effect on our licenses and impact our ability to generate revenue from offering our products and services to customers. See “—Risks Relating to Information Technology Systems _and Intellectual Property—We depend on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of products (including data and content) and services that are important to our business.

Certain third-party service providers may determine that an association with us could result, directly or indirectly, in adverse consequences for their business and so they may be unwilling to provide their services to us and/or prohibit or restrict our customers from using such third-party service provider’s technology, business or services for the purposes of interacting with and/or doing business with us. For example, certain software and/or hardware companies may refuse to make their devices or software compatible with our betting and iGaming applications or other online product offerings to customers and/or they may restrict access to our betting and iGaming applications through such third party’s platforms. There have been cases of internet service providers blocking iGaming websites in certain of the European jurisdictions in which we operate without a local, territory or point of consumption license because those jurisdictions do not have such a licensing framework in place, and further instances could potentially reduce our market share of iGaming in such countries. In addition, banks and/or other payment processors may prohibit or restrict customers’ ability to process payments relating to online betting and iGaming websites or applications on a mandatory basis or at the request of a customer. Should such restrictions and rejections become more prevalent, betting and iGaming activity by our customers or the conversion of registered customers into AMPs could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 19 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of sports bet or game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. Although each game or sports bet generally performs within a defined statistical range of outcomes, actual outcomes may vary for any given period. In addition to the element of chance, win rates may also be affected by factors that are beyond our control, such as a customer’s experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of customers, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time spent engaging with our product offerings. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates on our games and sports bets may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our iGaming or sportsbook customers exceeding those anticipated. This variability has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In our iGaming product offerings, operator losses are limited per stake to a maximum payout. When looking at bets across a period of time, however, these losses can potentially be significant. Our quarterly financial results may also fluctuate based on whether we pay out any jackpots to our iGaming customers during the relevant fiscal quarter. As part of our iGaming product offerings, we may offer progressive jackpot games. Each time a progressive jackpot game is played, a portion of the amount wagered by the customer is contributed to the jackpot for that specific game or group of games. Once a jackpot is won, the progressive jackpot is reset with a predetermined base amount. While we maintain a provision for these progressive jackpots in the event we choose to offer them, the cost of the progressive jackpot payout would be a cash outflow for our business in the period in which it is won with a potentially significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Winning is underpinned by a random mechanism, thus we cannot predict with absolute certainty when a jackpot will be won. Our success also depends in part on our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer preferences in a timely manner. As we will operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing industry and legal standards, our products will be subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty.

A material reduction in the number of our customers who have access to live sporting events could have an impact on the number of customers accessing our sports betting services and products which could in turn materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, our sports betting operations are subject to the seasonal variations dictated by the sporting calendar and are affected by the scheduling and live broadcasting of major sporting events.

Russia’s military action against Ukraine has led to an unprecedented expansion of economic sanctions programs imposed by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the socalled Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic.

Our ability to provide uninterrupted services is dependent on these systems. While we have certain incident and disaster recovery plans, business contingency plans and back-up procedures in place designed to minimize, mitigate, manage and recover from the risk of an interruption or failure of our critical IT systems, there 26 ----- is no guarantee that such plans and procedures will be able to adequately anticipate or plan for all such risks and we cannot eliminate the risk of a system failure, interruption or disruption occurring. Such failures may arise for a wide variety of reasons such as software malfunctions, insufficient capacity, including network bandwidth in particular during peak activity times, as well as hardware and software malfunctions or defects, or complications experienced in connection with the operation of such systems, including system upgrades. If our technology and/or IT systems suffer from major or repeated failures, this could interrupt or disrupt our trading, clearing, settlement, index, analytics, data information or risk management services and undermine confidence in our platforms and services, cause reputational damage and impact operating results. We rely, to some extent, on IT systems, cloud-based services or other networks that are provided, managed or hosted by third parties. We cannot guarantee that the measures such third parties put in place will be sufficient to prevent issues with their IT systems, and coordination with such third parties will be required to resolve any issues with IT systems, which may mean they take longer to resolve than if they were managed or hosted by us alone. To compete effectively, we must be able to anticipate and respond, in a timely and effective manner, to the need for new and enhanced technology. This may include new software applications or related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, or robotics. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent enhancements to existing products and services, the introduction of new services and products and changing customer demands. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective or better-functioning technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs. There can also be no assurance that our current systems will be able to support any new or emerging technologies, industry standards or enhanced products or services, or be able to accommodate a significant increase in online traffic, increased customer numbers, or modified usage patterns arising as a result of any such technologies, standards or products or services. If our systems are unable to expand to meet increased demand, are disrupted or otherwise fail to perform, or the adoption of new technologies requires greater investment than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could increase our operating expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate artificial intelligence in a similar or different manner, and may do so more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. At the same time, the use of artificial intelligence has recently become the source of significant media attention and political debate. If our use of artificial intelligence becomes controversial, we may experience brand, reputational or competitive harm. In addition, the introduction of these technologies, particularly generative artificial intelligence, into new or existing offerings may also result in new or expanded risks and liabilities, including due to enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, compliance issues, ethical concerns, confidentiality or security risks, as well as other factors that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial results. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, including with respect to compliance with existing and potential government regulation of such technology, may also require significant resources, including to develop, test and maintain platforms, offerings, services, and features to help us implement artificial intelligence in accordance with applicable law, and to minimize other adverse effects on our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or other cybersecurity incidents could result in: unauthorized access to our websites, networks or systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of customer information, including customers’ personal data or other confidential or proprietary information of Flutter, employees, customers or other third parties; unauthorized dissemination of proprietary or confidential information, including personal data, viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware or other malware attacking, or being spread through our websites, networks or systems; deletion or modification of content or the display of unauthorized content on our websites; interruption, disruption or malfunction of operations; costs relating to breach remediation, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, response to governmental investigations; media inquiries and coverage; engagement of third-party experts and consultants; litigation, regulatory action; and other potential liabilities. The secure collection, maintenance, processing and transmission of confidential and sensitive information, including personal data, is a critical element of our operations. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit certain confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our information technology and other systems, and those of our third-party service providers, that collect, maintain, process and transmit customer, employee, service provider and business partner information are susceptible to increasing threats of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. For example, we have received notice that certain of our customer and employee data was involved in the global incident involving the MOVEit file transfer software, which began when the third-party provider who administers the software announced that it had identified a previously unknown vulnerability in the application that is used by businesses across the world to share data and manage file transfers. Once we discovered this, we promptly undertook responsive measures, including restricting access to the affected application, launching an internal investigation in partnership with outside independent cybersecurity forensic experts and notifying the relevant regulators and law enforcement agencies, as well as our employees and customers, impacted by the incident. Based on this investigation and information currently known at this time, we do not expect that this incident will have a material impact on our operations or financial results. However, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenses related to this incident, and we have become subject to claims in relation thereto; accordingly, we remain subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of this incident. Moreover, these types of risks may increase over time as the complexity and number of technical systems and applications we use also increases. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the whole or partial failure of this technology to protect transaction data or other confidential and sensitive information from being breached or compromised. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our customers’ data. Third parties may attempt to create false or undesirable user accounts and advertisements or take other actions on our platform for objectionable ends, and compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing and credential stuffing, may be used to attack our websites and may result in an interruption, disruption or malfunction of our websites or IT systems, or the loss or compromise of data. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to breach our IT systems or data. Distributed denial-of-service (“DDoS”) attacks, “Trojan horse” attacks, computer malware, ransomware, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches, general hacking or other attacks and similar disruptions may jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity and security of information stored in, processed or transmitted by our websites, networks and systems, or that we or such third parties otherwise maintain, including payment card systems, which may subject us to fines or higher transaction fees or limit or terminate our access to certain payment methods. Further, sensitive, personal or other regulated data and information may be lost, disclosed, accessed, altered or taken without appropriate consent, which could subject us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that recovery protocols and backup systems will be sufficient to prevent data loss. Further, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will be successful, that we will be able to anticipate or detect all cyber-attacks or other breaches, that we will be able to react to cyberattacks or other breaches in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. In the past, we and 28 ----- our third-party vendors have experienced social engineering, phishing, malware and similar attacks and threats of DDoS attacks and such attacks could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these breaches of security should occur and be material, our reputation and brand could be damaged, our business may suffer, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remediate problems caused by such breaches and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and other liability. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage thirdparty experts and consultants. While our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experience a significant security incident, we could be subject to liability or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage and we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate applicable privacy, data protection, data security, network and IT systems security and other laws and regulations. Further, such laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing practices, which may require us to modify our practices and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. We may also incur significant reputational, legal and financial exposure, including legal claims, higher transaction fees and regulatory fines and penalties as a result of any compromise or breach of our systems or data security, or the systems and data security of our third-party providers and any personal data stored or processed therein. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches and may need to further devote significant resources in the future to address problems caused by breaches, including notifying affected subscribers and responding to any resulting litigation, which in turn, diverts resources from the growth and expansion of our business.

When we or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards. In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party’s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that our customers would be impacted by such a breach. To the extent our customers are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party, they would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions. It is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected customers and, even if we could, some customers’ new credit card information may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our customers are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal data generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant cost or customer effort. Additionally, if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card-related costs and substantial remediation costs or refusal by credit card processors to continue to process payments on our behalf, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

This requires us to comply with strict, numerous, and rapidly evolving data protection and privacy laws in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Brazil, Canada and many other jurisdictions regarding privacy and the collection, receipt, storage, processing, handling, maintenance, transfer, disclosure and protection of such personal and other data, which may require us to provide individuals with certain notices and rights with respect to such individuals’ personal data, maintain reasonable and appropriate data security standards and to provide timely notice to individuals and/or regulators in the event that such personal data is compromised. The scope of such laws are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between states or countries. We are also subject to various industry privacy standards, the terms of our own privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. For example, the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation) (the “GDPR”) which went into effect on May 25, 2018 has resulted in, and will continue to result in, significant compliance burdens and costs for companies with customers and/or operations in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR and national implementing legislation in EEA member states impose a strict data protection compliance regime including obligations concerning the rights of data subjects, the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area, security breach notifications and safeguarding the security and confidentiality of personal data. Under the GDPR, fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues, whichever is greater, can be imposed for violations. Data protection supervisory authorities also have extensive powers under the GDPR, including the power to impose a temporary or definitive ban on processing activity. The GDPR also includes a right to compensation for data subjects who have suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of the GDPR and in certain cases, civil litigation can be brought by non-profit privacy advocacy groups. In addition, EU Directive 2020/1828 on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers (the Directive on Representative Actions) applied from June 25, 2023, and it is expected to increase “class action”-type cases being brought by qualified entities in respect of certain GDPR infringements. Liability can attach to us not only for our own non-compliance, but also due to the acts, errors or omissions of those who process personal data in the course of providing services for us, as the GDPR includes joint and several liability provisions in certain cases. Regulatory guidance, case law and enforcement activity concerning data protection regulatory standards in the European Economic Area are increasing and further changes are likely to occur that will further enhance the data protection rights of individuals and have a commensurate impact upon our ability to process personal data in a manner that maximizes its commercial value. For example, while the European Commission recently issued an adequacy decision regarding transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area to the United States pursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, there remains complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions, which could lead to additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results. Further, the UK GDPR came into effect on January 1, 2021, and, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”). The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR (up to £17.5 million or 4% of the annual global revenues, whichever is greater). The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains uncertain, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium-to-longer term and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Compliance with the GDPR and the UK GDPR may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance-related costs and expenses and these changes may lead to other additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. Many jurisdictions outside of the United Kingdom and the European Union are enacting more robust data protection laws, in many cases following similar principles to those set out in the GDPR. For example, in the United States, our largest and fastest growing market, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several U.S. territories have some form of data breach notification laws, while individual states have introduced broader consumer privacy legislation. For example, in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was further expanded by the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, or CPRA, which took effect in most 30 ----- material respects on January 1, 2023 (with application to data collected beginning on January 1, 2022) (the “CCPA”) established a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours. The CCPA also provides for regulatory penalties for violations, as well as a private cause of action for data breaches, and the CPRA imposed even stricter obligations on companies and established a state regulatory agency to enforce those requirements. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. At least twelve additional U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy legislation. Most of these statutes impose less stringent obligations than the CCPA but generally align to the same principles. These laws may require substantial modifications to covered companies’ data processing practices and policies, impose compliance-related costs and expenses to provide updated notices to employees and customers, and we may be required to negotiate or renegotiate contractual obligations with third-party service providers. Such laws will restrict processing activities, likely limiting our ability to market to customers and/or increasing operational and compliance costs. The introduction of new or further data protection laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we currently operate, including in Canada, modify our data processing activities and/or increase our operational and compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The myriad international and U.S. privacy and data breach laws are not consistent, and states frequently amend existing laws or promulgate new privacy regulations under existing statutory authority, requiring attention to changing regulatory requirements. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose self-regulatory standards from time to time. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards. We cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For instance, in addition to the variety of existing laws and regulations governing our use of personal data, there are a wide variety of other laws which are currently being enacted or under development and which may have a material impact on whether, and how, we can operate our online services in certain jurisdictions. For example, EU Regulation 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (the “Digital Services Act”) came into full effect in the European Union in February 2024, resulting in changes to the regulation of online content that is deemed to be illegal or harmful. Similarly, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act (the “AI Act”), will likely have implications for how AI technology is used in our business and across the industry generally. Although we make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable data protection and digital services laws and regulations, our interpretations and such measures may have been or may prove to be insufficient or incorrect. If we fail to adhere to applicable data protection, privacy and digital services laws, we may be subject to enforcement action, investigations, fines, regulatory proceedings and/or civil litigation. Any fines, investigations, regulatory proceedings, civil litigation or license revocations or refusals arising from a breach of applicable data protection, data security, privacy or digital services laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are held directly responsible for a data security breach, or if we are deemed to be jointly responsible for a data security or other data protection breach by one of our service providers, then the resultant losses suffered by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recoup such losses, whether in whole or in part, from our service providers or insurers. Additionally, breaches of the GDPR, the CCPA or other applicable data protection or digital services laws could also result in reputational damage to our brands, resulting in the loss of the goodwill of customers and the potential to deter new and existing customers, or could result in our brands being subject to the revocation of existing licenses and/or the refusal of new applications for licenses. Furthermore, we or our third-party service providers could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products and services to comply with existing and future data privacy and digital services laws and regulations, which could be costly, time-consuming and have an adverse effect on our or our third-party service providers’ business, results of operations or financial condition.

Third parties may assert claims against us, or our third-party licensors, alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, the outcome of litigation is uncertain and third parties asserting claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief against us, which could require us to redesign or reengineer our product offerings, and/or effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market our products. In addition, even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit, the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.

Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of third party patents may be unsuccessful. If we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards.

Where blocking obligations are currently imposed by governmental licensing requirements, there is a risk that the relevant regulators could require us to block customers resident in specific additional jurisdictions in the future. Where this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the technical systems and controls that we have adopted could fail or otherwise be found to be inadequate, either currently, as a result of future technological developments or as a result of customers in restricted jurisdictions seeking workarounds to the relevant systems and controls.

Our business model depends upon the continued compatibility and interoperability between our applications and the major mobile operating systems. Third parties with whom we do not have any formal relationships control the design of mobile devices and operating systems. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones, either of which may require us to make significant changes to our product offerings in order to ensure compatibility. Network carriers may also impact the ability to download applications or access specified content on mobile devices, and there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will start or continue to support or feature our product offerings. In addition, we rely upon third-party platforms for distribution of our product offerings. Our online product offerings are delivered as free applications through third-party platforms and are also accessible via mobile and traditional websites. Third-party application distribution platforms are the main distribution channels for our applications. As such, the promotion, distribution and operation of our applications are subject to the distribution platforms’ respective standard terms and policies for application developers, which are very broad and subject to frequent changes and interpretation, and may not always permit our applications to be offered through their stores. Furthermore, the distribution platforms may not enforce their standard terms and policies for application developers consistently and uniformly across all applications and with all publishers. We are dependent on the interoperability of our platforms with popular mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control, and any technical or other issues in such systems, or any changes in applicable law or regulations, our relationships with mobile manufacturers and carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our product offerings’ functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our product offerings, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver high-quality product offerings, or impose fees or other charges related to delivering our product offerings, could materially and adversely affect our product usage and monetization on mobile devices. Moreover, if any of the third-party platforms used for distribution of our product offerings were to limit or disable advertising on their platforms, either because of technological constraints or because the owner of these distribution platforms wished to impair our ability to publish advertisements on them, our ability to grow and retain our customer-base and generate revenue could be harmed. Also, technologies have been, and may continue to be, developed by companies, such as Apple and Google, that, among other things, block or limit the display of our advertisements and some or all third-party cookies on mobile and desktop devices, limit cross-site and crossdevice attribution, prevent measurement outside a narrowly-defined attribution window and prevent advertisement re-targeting and optimization. These developments could require us to make changes to how we collect information on, and track the actions of, our customers and impact our marketing activities. These changes could materially impact the way we do business, and if we or our advertising partners are unable to quickly and effectively adjust to new changes, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our products require high-bandwidth data capabilities in order to place time-sensitive bets. If the growth of high-bandwidth capabilities, particularly for mobile devices, is slower than we expect, our customer growth, retention and engagement may be seriously harmed. Additionally, to deliver high-quality content over mobile cellular networks, our product offerings must work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems and networks, and comply with regulations and standards, that we do not control. In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws governing Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products and increase our cost of doing business. Specifically, any laws that would allow mobile providers to impede access to content, or otherwise discriminate against content providers like us, including by providing for faster or better access to our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, we may not successfully cultivate relationships with key industry participants or develop product offerings that operate effectively with these technologies, systems and networks, or that comply with regulations or standards. If it becomes more difficult for our customers to access and use our platform on their mobile devices, if our customers choose not to access or use our platform on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose to use mobile products that do not offer access to our platform, then our customer growth, retention and engagement could be seriously harmed. 34 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Open source software is licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, which in some instances may subject us to certain unfavorable conditions, including requirements that we offer our products that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make publicly available all or part of the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. While we try to ensure that open source licensed code is not used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source license agreement, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful, that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in our platform, that our developers have not incorporated open source software into our products that we are unaware of or that they will not do so in the future. Furthermore, there are an increasing number of open source software license types, almost none of which have been interpreted by courts, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. As a result, there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or provide our products and services. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement claims or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our product offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, if at all, to reengineer all or a portion of our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our product offerings if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code. Further, in addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software carries greater technical and legal risks than those associated with the use of third-party commercial software. For example, open source software is generally provided without any support or warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement or the quality of the code, including the existence of security vulnerabilities. To the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of open source software, any undetected errors or defects in open source software that we use could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our systems and injure our reputation. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform and IT systems.

We are generally subject to laws and regulations relating to betting and iGaming in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business or, in some circumstances, of those jurisdictions in which our services are offered or available, as well as the general laws and regulations that apply to all e-commerce businesses, such as those related to privacy and personal data, tax and consumer protection. These laws and regulations vary from one jurisdiction to another and are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Future legislative and regulatory action, court decisions or other governmental action, which may be affected by, among other things, political pressures, attitudes and climates, as well as personal biases, may have a material impact on our operations and financial results. For example, after an extensive review of the Gambling Act of 2005, the legislation (as amended) that regulates gambling in Great Britain (the “UK Gambling Act”), the UK government recently introduced new proposals for changes to the gambling regulations in Great Britain. See “The UK government’s ongoing review _of the UK Gambling Act may result in more onerous regulation of the betting and iGaming industry in Great_ 35 ----- _Britain, part of our second-largest market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” Additionally, in December 2022, the Irish government published the first_ draft of the Gambling Regulation Bill which proposes major reform and consolidation of gambling laws in Ireland, including the creation of a Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland, which will have broad powers to publish further guidance and codes of conduct. The Gambling Regulation Bill seeks to (1) modernize the licensing system; (2) introduce robust enforcement measures, including suspension and revocation of licenses, financial penalties (up to the greater of 10% of the licensee’s annual turnover or €20,000,000) and imprisonment; and (3) protect vulnerable persons, including children and those experiencing gambling addiction, through prohibiting licensees from accepting credit cards for the purposes of gambling and the creation of National Gambling Exclusion Register and Social Impact Fund. Furthermore, in January 2019, legal counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a legal opinion on the Interstate Wire Act of 1961, as amended (“Wire Act”), which stated that the Wire Act bans any form of iGaming if it crosses state lines and reversed a 2011 DOJ legal opinion that stated that the Wire Act only applied to interstate sports betting. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in January 2021 that the Wire Act does not apply to iGaming. The U.S. federal courts’ stance on the applicability of the Wire Act with respect to interstate iGaming may be subject to potential changes in the future, and any such changes may be detrimental to our business operations. If the Wire Act is ultimately determined by courts to be applicable to iGaming and we are required to restrict our iGaming transactions in each state in which we operate to within such state, our costs will increase and it will become more difficult for us to scale our operations in the United States. Any adverse changes to the regulation of online betting and iGaming, the interpretation of these laws, regulations and licensing requirements by relevant regulators, or the revocation of operating licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our operations and generate revenue in the relevant jurisdiction. Governments may from time to time seek to restrict access to our products from their jurisdictions entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their jurisdictions for an extended period of time or indefinitely. In addition, government authorities in certain jurisdictions may seek to restrict customer access to our products if they consider us to be a threat to public safety or for other reasons. Changes to existing forms of regulation may also include the introduction of punitive tax regimes, larger financial guarantees, limitations on product offerings, requirements for ring-fenced liquidity, requirements to obtain licenses and/or caps on the number of licensees, restrictions on permitted marketing activities or restrictions on third-party service providers to online betting and iGaming operators. See also “—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry— _Uncertainty as to the legality of online betting and iGaming or adverse public sentiment towards online betting and iGaming may deter third-party suppliers from dealing with us.” In the event that access to our products is_ restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more jurisdictions, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, it may become commercially undesirable or impractical for us to provide online betting and iGaming services in these jurisdictions, our returns from such jurisdictions may be reduced and a reduction of the scope of our services to certain jurisdictions or withdrawing from certain jurisdictions entirely may result, with a consequent financial loss arising from the need to block access by customers located in the relevant jurisdictions. Failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations or licensing requirements may lead to penalties, sanctions or, ultimately, the revocation of relevant operating licenses and may have an impact on licenses in other jurisdictions. In addition, the compliance costs associated with these evolving and increasingly complex laws, regulations and licensing requirements may be significant. If we were to infringe the domestic regulatory regimes of any of the jurisdictions and markets where we operate, or may wish to operate in the future (even if inadvertent), or if changes to those regulatory regimes occur, it may result in additional compliance and litigation costs for us, or could restrict the range of products and services we offer and the value of our assets and/or require changes to certain of our business practices in some or all of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

These factors include: - the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction; - the terms of our betting and gaming licenses; 36 ----- - the approach by regulatory and other authorities to the application or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including the approach of such authorities to the extraterritorial application and enforcement of such laws; - state, federal or supranational law, including EU law, if applicable; and - any changes to these factors. The regulation and legality of online betting and iGaming and approaches to enforcement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (from open licensing regimes to regimes that impose sanctions or prohibitions) and is subject to uncertainties. In certain jurisdictions, there is no legislation which is directly applicable to our business. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we derived approximately 2.5% of our revenue from jurisdictions where we do not have a local, territory-specific or point of consumption license because those jurisdictions do not have such a framework in place. Furthermore, the legality of the supply of online betting and iGaming services in certain jurisdictions is not clear or is open to interpretation. In many jurisdictions, there are conflicting laws and/or regulations, conflicting interpretations, divergent approaches by enforcement agencies and/or inconsistent enforcement policies and, therefore, some or all forms of online betting and iGaming could be determined to be illegal in some of these jurisdictions, either when operated within the jurisdiction and/or when accessed by persons located in that jurisdiction. Moreover, the legality of online betting and iGaming is subject to uncertainties arising from differing approaches among jurisdictions as to the determination of where online betting and iGaming activities take place and which authorities have jurisdiction over such activities and/or those who participate in or facilitate them. Changes in regulation in a given jurisdiction could result in it being reassessed as a restricted territory without the potential to generate revenues on an ongoing basis. For example, due to a change in government regulations, we were forced to cease offering paid and free DFS contests in Ontario, Canada, in April 2022. In addition, in certain states in which we operate, including Texas and Florida, the applicable office of the Attorney General has issued an adverse legal opinion regarding DFS in the past. In the event that one of those Attorneys General decides to take action on the opinion from their office, we may have to withdraw our operations from such state, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our inability to operate in a large betting or iGaming market in the future or a number of smaller betting or iGaming markets which collectively are material, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is a risk that regulators or prosecutors in jurisdictions where we provide online betting or iGaming services to customers without a local license or pursuant to a multi-jurisdictional license, may take legal action in respect of our operations in that jurisdiction and any defense we raise to such actions may not be successful. Actions that may be taken may include criminal sanctions and penalties, as well as civil and administrative enforcement actions, fines, excessive taxation, funds and asset seizures, authorities seeking to seize funds generated from the allegedly illegal activity, as well as payment blocks and ISP blacklisting, some of which may be more readily enforceable within an economic area such as the European Economic Area. Even if such claims could be successfully defended, the process may result in a loss of reputation, potential loss of revenue and diversion of management resources and time. There is a significant risk that our assessment of the factors referred to above may not always accurately predict the likelihood of one or more jurisdictions taking enforcement or other adverse action against us, our customers or our third-party suppliers, which could lead to fines, criminal sanctions and/or the termination of our operations in such jurisdiction or jurisdictions, and, ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Certain jurisdictions in which laws currently prohibit or restrict online betting and iGaming or the marketing of those services, or protect monopoly providers of betting and iGaming 37 ----- services, may implement changes to open their markets through the adoption of competitive licensing and regulatory frameworks. We intend to expand our provision of online betting and iGaming services into certain new and existing jurisdictions and markets where the regulatory status of the provision of such services has been clarified or liberalized, including within North America, Europe and elsewhere internationally. In particular, in May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (“PASPA”) down as unconstitutional. This decision had the effect of lifting federal restrictions on sports betting and thus allowed U.S. states to determine the legality of sports betting for themselves. Since the overturn of PASPA, a number of U.S. states (as well as Washington D.C.) have legalized retail and/or online sports betting. Our ability to further expand our sports betting and online operations in the United States is dependent on the adoption of state statutes permitting such activities, as well as our ability to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in U.S. jurisdictions where such games are legalized. The failure of state legislators to implement a regulatory framework for providing sports betting and iGaming services in their jurisdictions in a timely manner, or at all, may prevent, restrict or delay our accessing such markets. For example, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, sports betting has not been legalized in the state of California. Given that California has 40 million inhabitants, attracts over 250 million annual tourists and boasts more professional sports teams than any other state in the United States, the legalization of online sports betting in California in the near future would open up a large and significant market to us. Even where licensing regimes are introduced in certain markets, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining a license to operate in such markets. See, for example, “—In some jurisdictions our key _executives, certain employees or other individuals related to the business will be subject to licensing or compliance requirements. Failure by such individuals to obtain the necessary licenses or comply with individual regulatory obligations could cause our business to be non-compliant with our obligations or imperil our ability to obtain or maintain licenses necessary for the conduct of our business. In some cases, the remedy to such situation may require the removal of a key executive or employee and the mandatory redemption or transfer of such person’s equity securities that he, she or it holds in us, if any.” In particular, under some jurisdictions’ sports_ betting and iGaming laws, particularly in certain U.S. states, online sports betting and/or iGaming licenses are tethered to a finite number of specifically defined businesses that are deemed eligible for an iGaming or sports betting license, such as land-based casinos, tribes, professional sports franchises and arenas and horse racing tracks, each of which is entitled to a skin or multiple skins under that state’s law. As such, the skin provides a market access opportunity for mobile operators to operate in the jurisdiction pending licensure and other required approvals by the state’s regulator. The entities that control those skins, and the numbers of skins available, are typically determined by a state’s sports betting or iGaming law. In certain U.S. states, we currently rely on skins tethered to land-based casinos, tribes, professional sports franchises and arenas and horse racing tracks in order to access a number of markets through a skin. In other markets, we may obtain a license to offer online sports betting and/or iGaming through a direct license offered by the jurisdiction, which in some cases may be subject to a competitive application process for a limited number of licenses. Furthermore, our partnership with Boyd and contractual relationships with other identified license holders provide us with primarily first skin access for sports betting in states where such access is required. Because the number of skins or direct licenses offered by a jurisdiction may be limited, if we cannot establish, renew or manage our market access relationships in the jurisdictions in which they are required or successfully obtain licenses through the competitive direct license process in other jurisdictions, we would not be allowed to operate in those jurisdictions until we enter into new relationships, which could be at a significantly higher cost if at all. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, even if we are successful in obtaining a license, any such license may be subject to onerous licensing requirements, together with sanctions for breach thereof and/or taxation liabilities that may make the market unattractive to us or impose restrictions that limit our ability to offer certain of our key products or services or to market our products in the way we want to. See, for example, “—Risks Relating to Our Business and _Industry—Our success may be impacted by our ongoing ability to market to our customers in certain jurisdictions.” In addition, a license may require us to offer our products in partnership or cooperation with a local_ market participant, thereby exposing us to the risk of poor or non-performance by such market participant of its applicable obligations, which could in turn disrupt or restrict our ability to effectively compete and offer one or more of our products in the relevant market. Finally, the complexity arising as a result of multiple state/regional regulatory regimes, in particular within the United States where gaming is largely regulated at the state level, may result in operational, legal and administrative costs for us, particularly in the short term. Moreover, our competitors, or their partners, may already be established in a jurisdiction or market prior to our entry (e.g., in certain U.S. states). If regulation is liberalized or clarified in such jurisdictions or markets, then we may face increased competition from other providers and competition from those providers may increase 38 ----- the overall competitiveness of the online betting and iGaming industry. We may face difficulty in competing with providers that take a more aggressive approach to regulation than we do and are consequently able to generate revenues in markets from which we do not accept customers or in which we will not advertise. See “—Risks _Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our business is exposed to competitive pressures given the international nature of competition in online betting and iGaming.” Additionally, we may face operational difficulties in_ successfully entering new markets, even where regulatory issues do not materially restrict such entry. See “— _Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our operational efforts to expand our customer base in existing and new geographic markets, particularly with respect to our U.S. business, which is critical to our long-term ambitions, including our efforts to cross-sell to existing customers, may not be successful.”_ While clarification and liberalization of the regulation of online betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions and markets, particularly in the United States, may provide us with growth opportunities, successful expansion into each potential new jurisdiction or market will present us with its own complexities and challenges and is dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control. Efforts to access a new jurisdiction or market may require us to incur significant costs, such as capital, marketing, legal and other costs, as well as the commitment of significant senior management time and resources. Furthermore, notwithstanding our efforts to access a new jurisdiction or market, our ability to successfully enter such jurisdictions or markets may be affected by future developments in state/regional, national and/or supranational policy and regulation, limitations on market access, competition from third parties and other factors that we are unable to predict and which are beyond our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding the provision of online betting and/or iGaming services into such jurisdictions or markets or that our service and product offerings in such jurisdictions or markets will grow at expected rates or be successful in the long term.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations or enact new laws and regulations regarding these matters. As a result, these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules. Non-compliance with any such law or regulations could expose us to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business. Fines have previously been levied against us, particularly in the United Kingdom and United States, including a significant fine by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (“UKGC”) and certain other fines by relevant U.S. regulators, and it is likely that such enforcement initiatives will not only continue but could also potentially increase in frequency and scope. For example, one of our competitors was recently fined a record £19.2 million by the UK government for failures to comply with the Gambling Act, particularly regarding social responsibility and anti-money laundering rules. See also “—The UK government’s ongoing review of the UK Gambling Act may result in more onerous regulation of _the betting and gaming industry in Great Britain, part of our second-largest market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ In addition to fines and other financial penalties, the consequences of such enforcement action could include a revocation of the relevant entity’s license, a suspension of that license and/or the imposition of certain adverse licensing conditions. The loss of a gaming license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a gaming license or affect our eligibility for such a license in another jurisdiction, and any of such losses, or potential for such loss, could cause us to cease offering some or all of our services or products in the relevant jurisdictions. See also “—We face the risk of loss, revocation, non-renewal or change in the terms of our betting and gaming _licenses.”_ If regulatory enforcement proceedings are brought against us, there is an increased risk that third parties, including but not limited to customers and third-party service providers, could commence litigation against us, particularly where such regulatory enforcement proceedings have been successful, resulting in reputational 39 ----- damage to our brands. The loss of the goodwill may deter new and existing customers and/or third-party service providers and negatively impact our operating results. Certain jurisdictions also license key management on an individual basis, and, to the extent that any compliance shortcomings are evident and ultimately pursued through enforcement actions, there is a risk that certain regulatory sanctions could be imposed against our key management. If members of our key management become subject to regulatory sanctions in certain jurisdictions, we may face difficulties in maintaining or renewing existing licenses in other regulated jurisdictions in which we operate or in obtaining new licenses in jurisdictions into which we wish to expand.

See “Business—Our Licenses—United Kingdom and _Ireland—United Kingdom.”_ The UK government’s review of the UK Gambling Act is extensive in scope. Key areas under review include: - the effectiveness of the existing online protections in preventing gambling harm and an evidencebased consideration of, by way of example, imposing greater control on online product design such as stake, speed and prize limits and the introduction of deposit, loss and spend limits; - the benefits or harms caused by allowing licensed gambling operators to advertise and make promotional offers and the positive or negative impact of gambling sponsorship arrangements across sports, e-sports and other areas; - the effectiveness of the regulatory system currently in place, including consideration of whether the UKGC has sufficient investigative, enforcement and sanctioning powers both to regulate the licensed market and address the unlicensed market; - the availability and suitability of redress arrangements in place for an individual consumer who considers it may have been treated unfairly by a gambling operator, including consideration of the introduction of other routes for consumer redress, such as a gambling ombudsman; and - the effectiveness of current measures to prevent illegal underage gambling and consideration of what extra protections may be needed for young adults in the 18−25 age bracket. The call for evidence in connection with the review concluded in March 2021. On April 27, 2023, the UK government issued a white paper, which included proposals to: - hold a consultation to determine the maximum staking limit for online slot gaming products of between £2 and £15 per spin, with options of a £2 limit per stake, £4 limit per stake or an approach based on individual risk for 18-24 year-old players; - hold a consultation to determine whether to make player-set deposit limits mandatory or opt-out rather than opt-in; 40 ----- - introduce a statutory levy (as a percentage of revenue) requiring all licensed operators to make contributions to help fund research, education and treatment of gambling harms; and - hold a consultation on imposing new obligations on licensed operators to conduct: - enhanced spending checks if a player loses £1,000 within one day or £2,000 within 90 days, with such thresholds halved for 18-24 year-old players; and - financial vulnerability checks if a player loses more than £125 within one month or £500 within one year. This review is in addition to recent reforms introduced by the UKGC. For example, in 2020, the UKGC introduced a ban on the use of credit cards to place bets (for additional information about this ban and its effects on our business, see “—Financial and Banking Risks Relating to Our Operations—We depend on the ongoing _support of payment processors and international multi-currency transfer systems”) and issued industry guidance_ regarding high-value customer schemes (often referred to as VIP programs), which include, among other measures, a requirement for licensed operators to undertake checks to establish that a high-value customer’s spending is affordable and sustainable, whether there is any evidence of gambling-related harm or heightened risk linked to vulnerability, and that the operator has in place up-to-date evidence relating to the individual’s identity, occupation and source of funds. Further, in February 2021, the UKGC also announced a number of measures that have impacted the design and offer of online slots games, including the banning of the following features with effect from October 31, 2021: (i) features that speed-up play or give the illusion of control over the outcome; (ii) slot spin speeds faster than 2.5 seconds; (iii) auto-play, which can lead to players losing track of their play; and (iv) sounds or imagery which give the illusion of a win when the return is in fact equal to or below a stake. Further, in September 2021, Public Health England, which was at the time an executive agency of the UK Department of Health, issued a report dealing with the costs of gambling-related harm, in response to which Public Health England has urged the UK government to treat gambling-related harm as a public health issue. The UKI division is our second-largest division and generated 25.8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Although we seek to meet or exceed best practices in operations and customer protection with an emphasis on fair and responsible gaming, changes to regulation arising from the UK government’s review of the UK Gambling Act, or recent or further measures introduced by the UKGC or other bodies, could impede our ability to generate revenue in Great Britain and attract or retain new and existing customers in Great Britain, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In line with our strategy to take a leadership role in responsible betting and gaming, we have implemented a broad range of player protections over the last three years during the pendency of the UK government’s review of the UK Gambling Act. We estimate that these changes have resulted in a loss of £150 million in annual revenue from our UKI business and that the incremental revenue impact from the proposed measures announced in the white paper could be between £50 million and £100 million, resulting in a total cumulative revenue impact of between £200 million and £250 million of annual UKI revenue. The review of the UK Gambling Act could also result in changes to taxation policy applied to the betting and gaming industry. In the event His Majesty’s Treasury observes a reduction in the total taxes collected due to lower operator revenue within the new regulatory environment, this could cause His Majesty’s Treasury to attempt to remedy this reduction in total taxes by increasing tax rates and/or making other tax policy changes related to the betting and gaming industry. In November 2023, the UK government announced that it will consult shortly on proposals to bring remote gambling into a single tax, rather than taxing it through a three-tax structure.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The criteria used by gaming authorities to make determinations as to who requires a finding of suitability or the suitability of an applicant to conduct gaming operations varies among jurisdictions, but generally requires extensive and detailed application disclosures followed by a thorough investigation. Gaming authorities typically have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be found suitable to conduct operations within a given jurisdiction.

Although the choice of law clauses in end-user terms and conditions stipulate that betting and gaming transactions take place in the location of the operator (rather than in the location of the customer), there is a risk that customers located in these markets could later demand to recover the funds that they have wagered on an online betting and iGaming site from the operators of the site. Player claims have materialized on an industry-wide basis in Austria and Germany for refunds of historic losses based on the assertion that, under applicable local law, the iGaming offering under a Maltese remote multi-jurisdictional license is contrary to local law. Last year we were granted a local gaming license in Germany with respect to the products upon which such claims are generally based and no longer operate with respect to those products in Germany under our Maltese remote license. However, we continue to operate under our Maltese remote license in Austria, where there is no available local regulatory framework. Generally, local courts have been ruling in favor of players in Germany and Austria, though a limited number of German courts have ruled in favor of operators. Certain claimants that have been successful in adjudicating final claims in Austria have sought enforcement of the resulting judgments in Malta. In June 2023, Malta enacted legislation which prohibits the enforcement of foreign judgments against authorized Maltese licensed operators who are acting lawfully in accordance with Maltese law, which enshrined into law long-standing Maltese public policy. To date, there has been no final decision in Maltese courts with respect to the enforcement of any player claim in Malta. If a material proportion of player claims were successfully enforced either in Malta or any other jurisdiction, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

In addition to the direct and indirect taxes that apply generally to businesses operating in relevant jurisdictions, we will be subject to specific taxes, duties and levies on the provision of betting and gaming services and related activities in a number of jurisdictions. By way of illustration, over recent years the gaming industry has seen additional taxation levied by the legislatures of various countries including the following: - in Ireland, the duty on sports-betting stakes was doubled from 1% to 2% with effect from January 1, 2019; 47 ----- - in the United Kingdom, the UK remote gaming duty payable on a gaming provider’s profits from remote gaming with UK persons was increased from 15% to 21% on April 1, 2019; - in Germany, the German government introduced a gaming tax of 5.3% in 2021, which is applied on the stakes we receive from our poker and slots products, giving rise to a materially higher tax cost for our business; - in Australia, the point-of-consumption-tax imposed on online and land-based operators was increased in 2022 across a number of Australian states: in New South Wales from 10% to 15%, in the Australian Capital Territory from 15% to 20% (and a further increase from 20% to 25% on July 1, 2023) and in Queensland from 15% to 20%, together with a widening of the tax base to include tax on free bet stakes; - in India, Parliament confirmed an increase in the goods and services tax rate from 18% to 28% and determined the tax base should be customer deposits rather than gross gaming revenue with effect from October 1, 2023; and - in Ohio, the sports wagering tax rate imposed on online and land-based operators was increased from 10% to 20% as of July 1, 2023. The betting and gaming industry has been, and may continue to be, the object of sporadic taxations in the future. If the rates of such taxes, duties or levies were to be increased or if the tax base of such taxes, duties or levies were to be widened (e.g., as a result of changes to the treatment of free bets, free plays, bonus credits or non-stake amounts received by operators such as account management fees, a move from a gross profits basis of taxation to a turnover basis, a move from a place of supply basis to a place of consumption basis or the imposition of new or increased withholding obligations), then this may have a material adverse effect on the overall tax burden that we bear. Tax changes are not limited to markets in which the provision of betting and gaming services is regulated at the local, national or federal level, as we pay Value-Added Tax, Goods and Services Tax, or other similar taxes (collectively, “VAT”) or other betting and gaming taxes in some markets in which the provision of betting and gaming services are not regulated at the local, national or federal level. We currently pay VAT in territories where we have determined that it is applicable but we do not pay VAT in territories where we have determined that it is not applicable to our business. Due to the uncertainty of the application of VAT law to our services, there could be additional territories where local authorities consider that the interpretation that VAT does not apply to some or all of our respective businesses is incorrect, and that VAT does apply, which could have a material adverse impact on our tax burden. Our customers are located worldwide. If jurisdictions where betting and gaming winnings are currently not subject to income tax, or are taxed at low rates, were to begin to levy taxes or increase the existing tax rates on winnings, betting and gaming might become less attractive for customers in those jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,"Risks Relating to Regulation, Licensing, Litigation and Taxation",13.5.19,Risk of disproportionate liability following changes in taxation law relating to our operations.,"We are subject to a number of different tax regimes across the jurisdictions in which we operate. From time to time, these tax regimes change, often driven by new regulations or policies applicable to online betting and iGaming in the relevant jurisdictions. In certain circumstances, the effect of such changes could have a disproportionate effect on some of our operations. In this regard, heightened attention has been given at national and supranational levels, including through the G20/Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project, as well as in other public forums and the media, with regard to matters of cross-border taxation, and in particular, to taxation of the digital economy. For example, the United Kingdom implemented the offshore receipts in respect of intangible property rules imposing UK tax on the receipt of royalties by offshore companies deriving from business activity in the United Kingdom. Ireland, Gibraltar and Malta transposed the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive into domestic law, including changes with respect to exit tax, General Anti-Abuse Rules and Controlled Foreign Corporation rules. Due to pressure from the European Union, many offshore jurisdictions have introduced “substance” requirements including with regard to intangible property companies. The likelihood of scrutiny of tax practices by tax authorities in relevant jurisdictions and the aggressiveness of tax authorities 48 ----- remains high. In this context, we expect to be subject to increased reporting requirements regarding our international tax structure. With respect to the OECD’s BEPS 2.0 project in December 2021, the OECD published the BEPS 2.0 Pillar Two model rules for domestic implementation of a 15% global minimum tax, and the European Union followed suit shortly thereafter. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s Pillar Two global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on consolidated groups with revenues of at least €750 million, which would go into effect from 2024. Ireland has implemented the EU directive implementing this minimum tax rate for accounting periods commencing on or after January 1, 2024. The Pillar Two model rules propose both an income inclusion rule, as well as an undertaxed payment rule. The income inclusion rule proposes a minimum tax rate concept applied by the tax authority of the jurisdiction of tax residence of a parent company (or an intermediate holding company in certain circumstances) to the profits of the Group. This is combined with the undertaxed payments rule which seeks to tax (e.g., by denying deductions for, payments to entities in low tax jurisdictions to the extent the income is not subject to tax under an income inclusion rule). We have active subsidiaries in a number of lower tax countries, and the introduction of any such measures could have an adverse effect on the overall tax burden borne by us. The technicalities of how the OECD Pillar Two model rules and the EU directive are transposed into domestic legislation by each jurisdiction are still to be determined and consultation on a number of areas remains ongoing. We will continue to monitor developments closely, though we expect this could lead to an increase in the Group’s effective tax rate from 2024 onwards. The OECD’s BEPS 2.0 project has also proposed a new basis for taxing profits attributable to intangible assets under Pillar One, including new rules for defining a taxable presence for businesses which operate in a market without a physical presence by using a concept of “significant economic presence” or “significant digital presence” and seeking to apply a formulary approach using attribution factors that give greater weight to the user or consumer market location once the threshold for triggering sufficient “nexus” in that market has been reached. Such changes could result in us being treated as having a taxable presence, and becoming subject to tax, in jurisdictions in which we are not currently taxable but in which we will have a “digital” presence and/or in our profits being allocated or attributed between the various jurisdictions in which we operate on a revised basis. It was originally proposed that changes under Pillar One would take effect from 2023 but consensus on the rules has been delayed; however, the OECD’s Outcome Statement of July 11, 2023 indicates that substantial progress has now been made, with multi-lateral conventions on key aspects of the proposal expected to be open for signature in 2023 and expected to come into force from 2025. Additionally, the OECD announced on July 11, 2023 that agreement had been reached between 138 countries not to impose unilateral digital services taxes (“DSTs”) from January 1, 2024 until the earlier of December 31, 2024 and the entry into force of the Pillar One multi-lateral convention. Nevertheless, there remains a risk that other jurisdictions may seek to take unilateral action through DST regimes intended to capture the value generated from users/consumers located in the taxing jurisdiction by certain digital business models such as search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces —either before or after January 1, 2024. Until January 1, 2024, certain jurisdictions may continue to impose DSTs and in those jurisdictions tax authorities could seek to apply DSTs to our revenues, in particular Betfair Exchange and online poker revenues, depending on the terms of the applicable legislation. While some guidance has been released in relation to the application of these taxes, there is no certainty on the application of the rules to betting and gaming businesses. For example, we currently pay DST in Italy on these revenue streams, but there is a lack of clarity on how similar laws in other European countries such as France should be applied to the industry. Canada (in particular) proposes to implement a DST with effect from January 1, 2024, notwithstanding the OECD consensus. It is currently unclear how any additional tax payable in those other jurisdictions will impact on the tax payable in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, on similar taxable income. In the United States, state legislatures, as well as tax authorities, review the tax positions of companies from time to time. The federal government and individual states may consider changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in the jurisdictions where we do business. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. Potential tax increases cannot be predicted with certainty and could materially impact our business. Many questions remain about the enactment, form and application of these digital services taxes. The interpretation and implementation of the various digital services taxes (especially if there is inconsistency in the application of these taxes across tax jurisdictions) could have a materially adverse impact on our business, 49 ----- financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if the U.S. tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, tax authorities may impose indirect taxes on Internet-related commercial activity based on existing statutes and regulations which, in some cases, were established prior to the advent of the Internet. Tax authorities may interpret laws originally enacted for mature industries and apply it to newer industries, such as DFS, sports betting, iGaming or online horse racing wagering. The application of such laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the Office of the Chief Counsel of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) issued on August 7, 2020, a Generic Legal Advice Memorandum (“GLAM”) expressing the view that an organization involved in the operation of fantasy sports is liable for the excise tax on wagers under IRC § 4401 because fantasy sports entry fees are wagers. If the effects of the IRS Office of the Chief Counsel’s memorandum were to be applied, fantasy sports entry fees would no longer be considered non-taxable entry fees into games of skill and would become subject to an excise tax ranging from 0.25% to 2% per entry fee, depending on whether or not the entry fee is authorized under the law of the state in which such entry fee was accepted. Additionally, instead of delivering IRS form 1099 to certain winning customers, we would be required to deliver IRS form W-2G more regularly, which would require significant operational process changes. Consistent with the GLAM, the IRS subsequently assessed the federal wagering excise tax, at the 0.25% rate, on DFS entry fees received from 20152021. FanDuel disputes the assessment and has challenged it administratively. If necessary, FanDuel intends to challenge the assessment in court since, consistent with the interpretation in over twenty states, we consider DFS to be a game of skill and, therefore, not gambling, and, by extension, not “wagering.” Further, we and others that operate in the fantasy sports industry, including through the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association, are engaged in the process of seeking to have the effects of the IRS Office of the Chief Counsel’s memorandum disapplied to us. The past and continuing efforts to seek such dis-application include participating in meetings (through outside legal counsel that represent us and others in the industry) with representatives of the IRS from time to time to further explain and discuss our industry’s operations and position and seeking further non-regulatory guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury. To date, the U.S. Department of Treasury has not issued such guidance, and the IRS Office of the Chief Counsel has not issued a subsequent memorandum on the subject nor has it agreed to dis-apply the memo to us. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance as to the success of these efforts or an expected timeline for when a final decision will be made by the IRS or any subsequent dispute resolution processes or court proceedings. If fantasy sports entry fees become subject to the excise tax, fantasy sports platforms are forced to deliver to the IRS form W-2G for certain winning customers, or the IRS should issue further assessments and penalties for past treatment of DFS contests as non-wagering games of skill, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, on October 1, 2023, the Indian Parliament confirmed an increase in the goods and services tax (“GST”) rate from 18% to 28% on online gaming and determined that the tax base should be player deposits. Furthermore, India’s Goods and Services Tax Council (the “GST Tax Authorities”) are currently investigating the historical characterization of services for taxation and therefore the GST rate applicable to products such as rummy, fantasy games and poker offered by online gaming businesses. Industry precedent for products characterized as “games of skill” has been to subject them to a tax of 18% on commission charged from players. The GST Tax Authorities are asserting that these products should have been characterized as “games of chance” and subject to a higher tax rate of 28% on the amount staked by players. There have been tax demand notices issued to several online gaming businesses in connection with this investigation and the cases are currently being appealed and remain unresolved. The lead case (The Directorate General of GST Intelligence vs. Gameskraft Technologies Private Limited) was ruled in favor of Gameskraft, the taxpayer, at the Karnataka High Court in May 2023, who found the taxes had been paid in accordance with the law, but the case is now being appealed at the Indian Supreme Court. On January 8, 2024, the Indian Supreme Court also issued a notice to the Directorate General of GST Intelligence in response to petitions filed by the E-Gaming Federation, Games24x7 and Head Digital Works challenging the government’s decision to retrospectively impose 28% GST on amounts staked by players and directed the government and the GST department to file their response. The case remains unresolved at the time of issue of the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s operations in India (Junglee and Sachiko) have received requests from the GST Authorities for information but have not yet received a tax demand notice. Any unfavorable developments with respect to this Indian GST matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to periodic review and audit by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken or that we will take, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we 50 ----- believe that our tax provisions, positions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are subject to tax audits in certain jurisdictions, including Italy, the United States and Australia. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements included herein and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. For example, in December 2022, the Italian Tax Police initiated an investigation of the operations conducted by our PokerStars business in Italy (“PS Italy”), alleging that the PS Italy’s server infrastructure located in Italy amounts to an Italian permanent establishment for corporate tax purposes. We are fully cooperating with the Italian tax authorities during this initial stage and have not yet been notified of a formal assessment. Taking the discussion above into account, any changes in the rules regarding cross-border taxation or the revised interpretation of existing tax rules, could increase our tax liability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Additionally, following an initial transition period, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

In order to remediate the identified deficiencies, management has developed a comprehensive remediation plan which principally includes: (i) deploying additional resources with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and SEC reporting experience to implement or operate the newly designed controls and providing additional training, (ii) deploying revised risk assessment processes for the scoping of key controls designed to prevent and detect material misstatements, (iii) enhancing and expanding across the organization the implementation of the general IT processes and controls, (iv) improving the evidencing of the operation of controls, (v) developing controls over the completeness and accuracy of reports used in the operation of controls, (vi) formalizing the processes around management review controls and controls related to complex accounting areas and (vii) enhancing the monitoring of the system of internal control to timely identify and communicate internal control deficiencies to those parties responsible for taking corrective action. While implementation of the remediation plan remains ongoing, to date we have: (i) engaged external consultants with extensive expertise in internal controls, accounting and SEC matters to assist management in enhancing its overall internal control framework; (ii) upgraded our risk assessment; (iii) performed a control gap analysis and are in the process of designing enhanced business and IT processes and controls to the standards required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (iv) enhanced the IT processes and controls in relation to the user access management; (v) provided additional trainings to all relevant personnel focusing on the documentation and evidencing of operation of controls; and (vi) enhanced our internal control monitoring plans.

Anything that could interfere with our relationships with payment service providers would have a material adverse effect on our business. The introduction of legislation or regulations restricting financial transactions with online betting and iGaming operators or prohibiting the use of credit cards and other banking instruments for online betting and iGaming transactions, or any other increase in the stringency of regulation of financial transactions, whether in general or in relation to the online betting and iGaming industry in particular, may restrict our ability to accept payment from our customers or facilitate withdrawals by them. For example, in January 2020 the UKGC announced that, with effect from April 14, 2020, betting and gaming operators will not be permitted to accept credit card payments from UK based customers, resulting in our loss of revenue. For additional information about this ban, see “— _Risks Relating to Regulation, Licensing, Litigation and Taxation—The UK government’s ongoing review of the UK Gambling Act may result in more onerous regulation of the betting and gaming industry in Great Britain, part of our second-largest market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” Since the implementation of UK’s ban on the use of credit cards to place bets online, we_ have suffered an estimated annualized loss of revenue of approximately $40 million-$45 million. Certain governments may seek to impede the online betting and iGaming industry by introducing legislation or through enforcement measures designed to prevent customers or financial institutions, based in their jurisdictions, from transferring money to online betting and iGaming operations. They may seek to impose embargoes on currency use, wherever transactions are taking place. For example, since June 2010, Norway has enacted several pieces of legislation aiming to prevent the remittance of monies from Norwegian bank accounts to gaming operators. This may result in the providers of payment systems for a particular market deciding to cease providing their services for such a market. This in turn would lead to an increased risk that payments due to us are misappropriated, frozen or diverted by banks and credit card companies. There may be a limited availability of alternative systems, in particular in light of recent consolidation in the financial services industry. As a result, payment systems providers may increase their charges to us or our customers, and/or we may be required to source new payment systems providers of lesser quality and reliability than those providers previously used to service a particular market, which would also enhance the risk of default or delayed payments in circumstances where it would be too time consuming and challenging to sue for recovery. The likelihood of any such legislation or enforcement measures is greater in certain markets that seek to protect their state betting and gaming monopolies and/or that have foreign currency or exchange control restrictions. 53 ----- The tightening, or other modifications to, or changes in interpretation of anti-money laundering regulations may also affect the speed and convenience of payment processing systems, resulting in added inconvenience to customers. Card issuers and acquirers may dictate how transactions and products need to be coded and treated which may also impact on acceptance rates. Certain card issuers, acquirers, payment processors and banks may also cease to process transactions relating to the online betting and iGaming industry as a whole or certain operators (including us) for reputational and/or regulatory reasons or in light of increased compliance standards of such third parties that seek to limit their business relationships with certain industry sectors considered as “high risk” sectors. A number of issuing banks or credit card companies may, from time to time, reject payments to us that are attempted to be made by customers. Should such restrictions and rejections become more prevalent, or any other restriction on payment processing be introduced, iGaming activity by our customers or the conversion of registered customers into AMPs could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if any relevant regulator were to challenge our payment arrangements, and we were unable to withstand such challenge, we would have to reorganize the way in which we receive payments from our customers.

We have previously received confirmation from the FCA that the acceptance by the relevant entity of such payments does not constitute “deposit taking” and that therefore we do not require authorization under applicable financial services legislation in the United Kingdom. If this position were to change, or if our UKbased business were found to be subject to any proposed changes to the FCA’s Licensing, Compliance and Enforcement Policy, we may have to either reorganize the way in which we receive payments from our customers or seek to obtain relevant authorizations. Such a reorganization of payment systems could disrupt our operations and result in our incurring unforeseen costs and expenses. In addition, any failure to obtain a necessary authorization may prevent us from continuing to provide our products in the same way as we currently do which may impose additional costs on the provision of such products or prevent us from providing some or all of our products to certain customers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Chargebacks are a cost of most retail-based businesses and do not relate only to online betting and iGaming. Cardholders are supposedly able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. Customers occasionally seek to reverse their real money losses through chargebacks. We place emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks, including tracking customers that have previously charged back and by providing our customers with a variety of alternative payment processing methods such as e-wallets and pre-paid cards to reduce the risk of chargebacks. We expect that a proportion of our customers will continue to reverse payments made by card and other payment methods through the use of chargebacks, and if this is not controlled, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The Exchange Act requires us to file annual and other 54 ----- reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting beginning with our next annual report with the SEC. Compliance with these requirements places additional demands on our legal, accounting, finance and investor relations staff and on our accounting, financial and information systems, and will increase our legal and accounting compliance costs as well as our associated compensation expense. As a U.S.-listed company, we may also need to enhance our investor relations and corporate communications functions. These additional efforts may strain our resources and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We expect to incur additional incremental ongoing and one-time expenses in connection with our transition to becoming a U.S.-listed company. The actual amount of the incremental expenses we will incur may be higher, perhaps significantly, from our current estimates for a number of reasons, and there may be additional costs we may incur that we have not currently anticipated. We currently anticipate that we will be required to comply with the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by the end of 2024. At that time, our management will be required to conduct an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and include a report on these internal controls in the annual reports we will file with the SEC, and our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls. This process will require significant documentation of policies, procedures and systems, review of that documentation by our internal auditing and accounting staff and our outside independent registered public accounting firm and testing of our internal control over financial reporting by our internal auditing and accounting staff and our outside independent registered public accounting firm. This will involve considerable time and attention, may strain our internal resources and will increase our operating costs. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses and outside auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for U.S. public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due.

In particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by Russia’s actions in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have had an adverse impact on certain of our operations which, in turn, adversely affected our ability to generate cash flows from operations. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

Following the Transactions, the Issuer will be dependent upon the direct or indirect cash flow from the operating entities within the Group in the form of intercompany loans, dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Given the Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to the Group’s results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. Group entities, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream, downstream or crossstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these entities to move cash within the Restricted Group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some Group subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Group's subsidiaries to pay dividends to their respective shareholders will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due.

Certain of the Guarantors are organized or incorporated under the laws of Alderney, Australia, Delaware, England and Wales, Gibraltar, Ireland, Isle of Man, Malta and the Netherlands. Enforcement of the obligations under a Notes Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Notes Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Notes Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Notes Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Notes Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Notes Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amount of its obligations and upon applicable laws. This could lead to a situation in which such Notes Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. The Notes would therefore be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Guarantors to the extent that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of 57 ----- Notes that can be guaranteed or secured by such Guarantors. Future Notes Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-ranking priority of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures that may be introduced in response to any pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Collateral. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Company or its subsidiaries during such period, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor or security agent subject to the Intercreditor Agreement will be applied in accordance with the order of priority outlined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” As a result, holders of the Notes will share the proceeds of the enforcement sale of such Collateral with holders of other secured indebtedness of the Restricted Group that is secured on a _pari passu basis with the Notes, which may be significant.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee who (subject to the provisions of the Indenture 59 ----- and the Intercreditor Agreement) will provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Security Agent will act with respect to the Collateral only at the direction of an “instructing group” (as defined under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement”). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a senior or pari passu basis with_ the Notes, the voting interest of the holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the applicable Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not (explicitly) been tested in the courts of these jurisdictions and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent.

The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Many of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. 61 ----- The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties, may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. The Collateral consists of a substantial portion of the total value of the Collateral, which will limit the security of holders of Notes during the period following the Issue Date, until the accession of the Guarantors that will provide the Collateral. The Issuer and the Guarantors may not be successful in procuring such Notes Guarantees within the time periods specified and the Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain agreed security principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or other subsidiaries of the obligation to grant security interests in shares or intercompany loan receivables otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral or the obligation to provide a Notes Guarantee, the failure of which would result in an “event of default” under the Indenture which could have a material adverse effect on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Credit Facilities and otherwise as set forth under “Limitations _on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,”_ which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee or 62 ----- security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws.

The liens on the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or we are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Security Agent will not monitor (and we may not comply with our obligations to inform the Security Agent of) any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action may not be taken by us to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights.

The Indenture also permits the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. 64 ----- The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so in accordance with the provisions described in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions until it has been indemnified and/or secured that it may in its discretion require for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. If the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of any of the Company’s subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released.

Each Notes Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, certain of the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. However, the Indenture will provide that each Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor and each security interest granted by it under a Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by the relevant Guarantor or security provider without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee or Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, related third party transactions, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. 65 ----- Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Notes Guarantee against any Guarantor. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could (i) subordinate or avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the obligations under any Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor or the security interest granted by it under the Security Documents, (ii) if payment had already been made under a Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, if the court found, inter alia, that: - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; - the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantee or security interest has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; - the grant of the Notes Guarantee or security interest is, having regard to the risk accepted by the holders of the Notes, on terms which are, or were, such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether conditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the subscription for the Notes or otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider was (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity (and subject, in most cases, to the Notes Guarantee or security interest having been granted within the applicable “hardening period”); - the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest was not validly established or authorized or otherwise contravenes the relevant Guarantor or security provider’s articles of association; or - the relevant Notes Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objectives of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security grantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security grantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security grantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued or security granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent conveyance or 66 ----- improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Notes Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

See “Description of the Notes—Change of control.” If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations, would allow us to make such required repurchases. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors, which may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Revenue and stakes increased due to (i) the expansion of our online footprint to three new states in the year ended December 31, 2023 (Ohio, Massachusetts and Kentucky), including successful conversion of a high proportion of our DFS player base in these states to sportsbook products; (ii) a full year’s contribution from the five states opened in the year ended December 31, 2022; and (iii) continued strong online growth in pre-2022 state launches with revenue growth of 24.8%. Sportsbook AMPs were 53.1% higher at 2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin increased to 7.5% in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 7.3% in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to improvements in our pricing and risk management capabilities and product proposition, partially offset by an increase in new player incentives and customer friendly sports results. The impact of sports results, calculated as the difference between our expected net revenue margin and actual net revenue margin during 2023, was 50 basis points of adverse impact in 2023 compared with 10 basis points of favorable impact in 2022. iGaming revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 47.3% driven by both player growth and higher levels of engagement. Our focus on a broadened product portfolio and investing in the FanDuel Casino brand to acquire direct casino players led to a 41.8% increase in AMPs to 624 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other revenue for 2023 decreased by 9.2% driven by a decline in DFS where a portion of our DFS player base have migrated some or all of their play to our sportsbook product. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. was $65 million and $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a $412 million and $430 million increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin improved to 1.4% and 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from (10.9)% and (8.3)% in the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. This improvement was driven by operating leverage in (i) sales and marketing expenses which reduced as a percentage of revenue by 11.2 percentage points to 26.4% in the year ended December 31, 2023 and (ii) general and administrative expenses. The improvement was partially offset by higher technology, research and developments costs to ensure we continue to deliver new products for our customers. _Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021_ Total revenue for our U.S. segment grew 66.4% to $3,186 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflecting AMPs growth of 48.9%. Sportsbook revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 114.1% while amounts staked grew by 87.6% to $29,029 million. These increases were due to (i) the successful conversion of a significant portion of our DFS player base to our sportsbook product; (ii) expansion of our online footprint to five new states in the year ended December 31, 2022 (New York, Louisiana, Wyoming, Kansas and Maryland); and (iii) continued strong growth in states launched before the year ended December 31, 2021. Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin increased to 7.3% in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 6.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to improvements in our pricing and risk management capabilities and product proposition, partially offset by an increase in new player incentives in new states and in states where we have an existing presence. iGaming revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022 was 34.0% higher than the year ended December 31, 2021. This was driven by player growth and higher levels of engagement. Our focus on acquiring direct casino players, our broadened product portfolio and the new FanDuel Casino brand led to an increase of AMPs by 46.4% to 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 12.7%, driven by a decline in both DFS products and TVG horse racing. The DFS decline was due to the expansion of online sportsbook to more US states, which led to a decrease in DFS spend as a portion of our DFS player base migrated to our sportsbook product. Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. was $(347) million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a $364 million increase compared to $(711) million Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA 89 ----- Margin improved to (10.9)% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from (37.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2021. This improvement was driven by (i) a greater proportion of our revenue coming from states where we have an existing presence where the proportionate levels of marketing spend are lower, as well as expansion of our footprint across the U.S., which enabled us to benefit from the efficiencies of national advertising and (ii) economies of scale driven by expansion into new states. The improvement was partially offset primarily by higher gaming taxes as a percentage of revenue driven by the launch of operations in New York during the first quarter of 2022 and a significant incremental share-based payment charge in 2021 following a modification of the VCP in the U.S. division. Further Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. was $26 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2022 at $(263) million and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin improved 6.8 percentage points to (8.3)%. This reflects all the items noted above but excludes the impact of the lower share-based payment charge, including a significant incremental share-based payment charge in the year ended December 31, 2021 following a modification of the VCP in the U.S. division.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

This was despite a 1.9% increase in AMPs to 1.11 million, as we continue to retain customers at a high rate. The decrease in sportsbook revenue was driven by a 13.4% decline in amounts staked to $12,051 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which was driven by a softer racing market in 2023, when compared to 2022, which benefited from higher levels of customer engagement during COVID-related restrictions in the early part of that year. This was partly offset by an 80 basis points increase in Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin to 12.0%. The increase in net revenue margin was driven by improvements in our pricing and risk management capabilities. The impact of sports results, calculated as the difference between our expected net revenue margin and actual net revenue margin during the year ended December 31, 2023, was 60 and 50 basis points of favorable impact in the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 650 and 660 basis points to 24.0% and 24.7%, respectively. The decrease in margin was primarily driven by (i) lower revenue; (ii) point of consumption tax rate increases introduced during the second half of 2022; (iii) higher technology, research and development costs to enable more customer facing content; and (iv) inflationary cost pressures resulted in higher general and administrative expenses. We believe that the challenging market, along with increased regulatory and compliance costs, will reduce Australian profitability further in the year ending December 31, 2024. _Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021_ Australia revenue declined 12.6% to $1,558 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 despite an 8.2% increase in AMPs to 1.1 million as a result of strong execution against our retention strategy. The decrease in sportsbook revenue was mainly driven by a 13.4% decrease in amounts staked to $13,908 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. As society fully opened during the second half of 2022, with consumer entertainment and travel options restored, we saw a reduction in spend per player while a proportion of players also returned to the retail sports betting market. The year ended December 31, 2022 was also impacted by a highly-competitive trading environment, with new brands entering the market, alongside sporting cancellations and disruptions due to weather conditions. Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin remained broadly in line year over year. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA for Australia was $477 million and $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a $122 million and $120 million decrease compared the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 300 and 280 basis points to 30.6% and 31.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily driven by (i) a decrease in revenues; (ii) an increase in point of consumption tax rates, which became effective during the second half of 2022; and (iii) increased sales and marketing expenses, particularly in the second half of 2022 due to increased competition within the Australian market and FIFA World Cup marketing campaigns. 93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

This primarily reflects the addition of Sisal and growth in our “Consolidate and Invest” markets above.

The increase in margin was primarily driven by a reduction in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue of 570 basis points to 15.0%. This was due to continued execution on our strategy of focused investment in our “Consolidate and _Invest” markets such as Turkey and India, while optimizing our spend in our “Optimize and Maintain” markets._ This more than offset an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue due to the consolidation of Sisal, which has a higher cost of sales and investment an increase in general and administration expenses during the year. _Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021_ Total revenue for our International segment increased by 16.0% to $2,055 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflecting a 28.7% increase in AMPs. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Sisal in August 2022, which contributed $465 million of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022. Junglee Games, acquired in January 2021, contributed $123 million in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases were partially offset by market exits from the Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine and the unwind of the prior year COVID-19-related increase in revenue. Sportsbook revenue increased by 71.6% to $326 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and iGaming revenue increased by 10.2% to $1,622 million. Growth across both sports and iGaming was primarily due to the acquisition of Sisal and growth in our “Consolidate and Invest” markets. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 2.7% to $107 million largely driven by an increase in Betfair Exchange revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA for International was $395 million and $416 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a 7.3% and 6.1%, increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 150 and 190 basis points to 19.2% and 20.2%, respectively.

The impact of sports results, calculated as the difference between our expected net revenue margin and actual net revenue margin during the year ended December 31, 2023, was broadly in line with the prior year with 20 basis points of adverse impact in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with 20 basis points of adverse impact in the year ended December 31, 2022. - iGaming revenue increased by 19.1% to $1,284 million driven by AMP growth of 11.8% through consistent delivery of product improvements and refreshed content across all of our brands. - Other revenue grew by 18.4%, to $180 million driven by the Betfair Exchange. UKI retail revenue increased by 11.0% to $374 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 driven by a strong performance across both sportsbook and iGaming. Retail sportsbook revenue grew 12.4% and retail iGaming revenue grew 8.1% as our shops benefited from product enhancements introduced during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA for UKI was $889 million and $911 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, a 17.4% and 17.4% increase, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 reflecting the online and retail performances described above. Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin both improved by 80 basis points to 29.2% and 29.9%, respectively. The improvement in margin was driven by efficiencies delivered within sales and marketing expenses, which reduced as a percentage of revenue by 90 basis points to 19.4%. _Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021_ Total revenue for our UKI segment decreased by 6.2% to $2,664 million reflecting growth in retail due to the opening of shops throughout the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with closures in the year ended December 31, 2021, which was offset by declines in our online revenue. UKI online revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $274 million, or 10.5%, to $2,372 million from $2,601 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was as a result of the following: - Online sportsbook revenue decreased by $303 million, or 21.6%, to $1,097 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $1,400 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of (i) a peak in online player engagement in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to pandemic-related 91 ----- shutdowns and (ii) the full-year impact in the year ended December 31, 2022 of our proactive safer gambling measures introduced during the year ended December 31, 2021. Online Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin was 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in online Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin was due to improvements in our pricing and risk management capabilities and an increase in the adoption of higher margin products due to the launch of our Bet Builder product proposition. These increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of more favorable sports results in the year ended December 31, 2021 than in the year ended December 31, 2022. - Online iGaming revenue increased $85 million, or 8.6%, to $1,078 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $993 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was mainly driven by the acquisition of tombola in January in 2022, which contributed $216 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and stronger player momentum throughout the year and consistent delivery of product improvements across all our brands. - Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $56 million, or 26.9%, to $152 million from $208 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was driven by a decline in Betfair Exchange net revenue. UKI retail revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $99 million, or 41.6%, to $337 million from $238 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was as a result of the following: - Retail sportsbook revenue increased by $70 million, or 44.9%, to $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $156 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of retail locations opening throughout 2022, compared to partial opening in 2021 as a result of COVID-19 restrictions when stores were closed from January to April in the United Kingdom and to May in Ireland. - Retail iGaming revenue increased $29 million, or 35.4%, to $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of UK retail locations opening throughout the year ended December 31, 2022, as described above. Adjusted EBITDA for UKI was $757 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a $24 million, or 3.1%, decrease compared to the $781 million Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the online and retail performances described above. Further Adjusted EBITDA was $776 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a $23 million, or 2.9%, decrease compared to the $799 million Further Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decreases in both Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA reflect the online and retail performances described above. Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin improved to 28.4% and 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 27.5% and 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The improvement in margin in the year ended December 31, 2022 was a result of (i) increase in our UKI retail revenues; (ii) lower employee performance related costs and (iii) realization of efficiencies in our marketing spend. These improvements in margin were largely offset by (i) higher transaction processing fees, streaming, data and employee fixed pay costs due to inflationary cost pressures and (ii) an increase in operating costs related to our retail locations as a result of such retail locations opening throughout the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to partial opening in the year ended December 31, 2021 on account of COVID-19 restrictions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2339,U.S.,2339.24,Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures,2339.24.1,,"Adjusted EBITDA is defined on a Group basis as net profit (loss) before income taxes; other (expense)/ income, net; interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; transaction fees and associated costs; restructuring and integration costs; legal settlements (loss contingencies) and gaming taxes expenses. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Further Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding share-based compensation charge. Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Further Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Segment Adjusted EBITDA excluding share-based compensation charge. Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures and should not be viewed as measures of overall operating performance, indicators of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as alternatives to operating profit/(loss) or net profit/(loss) measures, or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity, or as alternatives to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are presented solely as supplemental disclosures to reported GAAP measures because we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results and these measures are widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as measures of performance. Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, 95 ----- Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin when evaluating operating performance because we believe that they provide additional perspective on the financial performance of our core business. In presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, the Group excludes certain items as explained below: - Transaction fees and associated costs and restructuring and integration costs, which include charges for discrete projects or transactions that significantly change our operations, are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. - Legal settlements/loss contingencies and gaming tax disputes, which include charges for specific investigations and litigations, are excluded due to the difficulty in predicting their timing and scope and because they are considered by management to be outside the normal course of business. - Other (expense)/income, net is excluded because it is not indicative of our core operating performance. - Share-based compensation expense is excluded as this could vary widely among companies due to different plans in place resulting in companies using share-based compensation awards differently, both in type and quantity of awards granted. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are unaudited and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net profit/(loss) as indicators of our operating performance. In addition, other companies in the betting and gaming industry that report Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner and such differences may be material. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements. Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin have further limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect the Group’s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group’s working capital needs; - they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Group’s debt; - Further Adjusted EBITDA excludes share-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s statements of cash flows; and - the further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are those that management consider not to be representative of the underlying operations of the Group and therefore are subjective in nature.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service our long-term debt, and otherwise as described below under “—Obligations.” We believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements in the short term and long term by using available cash, internally generated funds and borrowing under committed credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1,497 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $440 million was held in pound sterling (“GBP”), $291 million was held in euro (“EUR”), $590 million was held in U.S. dollar (“USD”), and $176 million was held in other currencies, and outstanding long-term debt of $7,056 million. We experience a largely predictable degree of seasonal cash flows as our sports betting operations are subject to a seasonal variation dictated by the sporting calendar and are affected by the scheduling and live broadcasting of major sporting events. In some instances, the scheduling of major sporting events occurs seasonally (e.g., horse racing, the Premier League, the UEFA Champions League, the NBA, the NFL, MLB and the NCAA) or at regular but infrequent intervals (e.g., the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Football Championship).

In December 2021, we amended and restated the Term Loan A Agreement under which all of the lenders consented to an upsize of £100 million ($135 million) across the GBP First Lien Term Loan A and the GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 resulting in aggregate total commitments of £1.5 billion ($2 billion) consisting of GBP First Lien Term Loan A commitments of £1.02 billion ($1.4 billion) and a GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 commitment of £0.5 billion ($0.6 billion). In September 2022, as part of the refinancing of the incremental Term Loan B Facility of €2.0 billion ($2.0 billion) incurred to fund the acquisition of Sisal (as discussed below), we further amended and restated the Term Loan A Agreement under which the lenders named therein (including new lenders) agreed to an upsize of £267 million ($297 million) to the GBP Revolving Credit Facility (total revolving credit facility of £749 million ($834 million)) and a EUR First Lien Term Loan A of €549 million ($538 million) and a USD First Lien Term Loan A 2026 of $200 million. In November 2023, as part of a wider refinancing, we entered into the Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to refinance (by way of cashless roll) the entire Term Loan A Agreement comprising of GBP First Lien Term Loan A 2025 of £1,018 million ($1,292 million), which would have matured in May 2025, EUR First Lien Term Loan A 2026 of €549 million ($602 million), which would have matured in July 2026, and USD First Lien Term Loan A 2026 of $200 million, which would have matured in July 2026.

The EUR First Lien Term Loan A 2026 had an interest rate of Euro InterBank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus a margin of 2.75% with a EURIBOR floor of 0%. The USD First Lien Term Loan A 2026 had an interest rate of daily compound Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus CAS plus a margin of 2.75%.

Facilities drawn down could be prepaid at any time in whole or in part on five business days’ (in the case of a Term Rate Loan) or five RFR banking days (in the case of a compounded rate loan) (or such shorter period as the majority lenders may agree) prior notice (but, if in part, by a minimum of £5.0 million or its currency equivalent). The GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 could be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issuance of letters of credit and/or the establishment of ancillary facilities with lenders on a bilateral basis. Each cash advance under the GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 was to be repaid at the end of its interest period or in full on the maturity date being May 2025. Amounts repaid could be re-borrowed (with automatic netting in the case of any rollover of all or any part of a cash advance and in each case subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025). A commitment fee of 35% of the margin then applicable on the available undrawn commitment was payable quarterly in arrears during the availability period, or on the last day of the availability period, which was one month prior to the maturity date. A utilization fee was also payable in the range of 0.10% to 0.40% per annum based on the proportion of revolving credit facility loans to the total GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 commitments. The utilization fee accrues from day to day and was payable in arrears on the last day of each successive period of three months that ends during the availability period. As of November 30, 2023, there is no debt outstanding under the Term Loan A Agreement. The Term Loan A Facilities and the GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 were secured by a first ranking security over (i) the shares in all material subsidiaries as defined therein in the Term Loan A Agreement and, to the extent not a material subsidiary, each obligor (other than Flutter Entertainment plc) to the extent that the shares are owned by a member of the Group and (ii) such other assets of the obligors as required to be granted as security for the facilities under the Term Loan B Agreement. All of the facilities under the Term Loan A Agreement and the Term Loan B Agreement were secured by the same collateral. The Term Loan A Agreement required us to ensure that the ratio of consolidated net borrowings to consolidated EBITDA as defined therein (the net total leverage ratio) is not greater than 5.10:1 on a bi-annual basis.

In June 2020, we amended and restated the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement under which, among others, all the covenants and restrictions therein bind the combined Flutter and TSG allowing it to operate and integrate as such and the reporting obligations under the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement are synchronized with reporting of the consolidated financial results of the Group to other of the Group’s stakeholders. In July 2021, the Group entered into a second amendment to the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement under which the Group refinanced all existing term loans then outstanding under the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement to Dollar Term B Loans with an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, Euro Term B Loans with an aggregate principal amount of €507 million ($598 million) and a new incremental Term B Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (together the “2021 Term Loans”). In addition to refinancing the then-existing term loans, the proceeds from the 2021 Term Loans were used to settle the thenoutstanding senior unsecured notes, certain hedging liabilities, pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the refinancing and for other general corporate purposes. In July 2022, the Group entered into the third amendment to the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement under which the Group obtained an incremental term loan of €2.0 billion ($2.0 billion) to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Sisal. In September 2022, the Group refinanced the incremental term loan of €2.0 billion ($2.0 billion) by incurring new incremental term loans of $1.2 billion and the EUR First Lien Term Loan A and the USD First Lien Term Loan A as discussed above. In November 2023, as part of a wider refinancing, we entered into the Credit Agreement, as discussed below. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to refinance the entire USD First Lien Term Loan B 2026 (being the repayment of the outstanding principal of $2,880 million). As part of this transaction, $720 million of the principal of the 2028 USD Term Loan B Facility was also refinanced. The USD First Lien Term Loan B 2026 had an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% with a LIBOR floor of 0.00%. The 2028 USD Term Loan B Facility had an interest rate of SOFR plus a CAS plus a margin of 3.25% with a SOFR floor of 0.5% with a maturity date of July 2028. The Existing Term Loan B Facility has an interest rate of EURIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% with a EURIBOR floor of 0.00% with a maturity date of July 2026. Interest is payable on is payable on the last day of each interest period. An amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of USD First Lien Term Loan B outstanding immediately after the second amendment amounting to $2.9 billion and the new incremental term loan amounting to $1.3 billion incurred as part of the September 2022 refinancing was repayable in quarterly installments with the balance due on maturity. The entire principal of Existing Term Loan B Facility and the principal are due at maturity. We have the right to prepay the Term B loans in whole or in part, without premium or penalty in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of $0.5 million or €0.5 million, in each case as such amount corresponds to the denomination of the applicable Term B loan and not less than $1 million or €1 million, in each case as such amount corresponds to the denomination of the applicable Term B loans or, if less, the amount outstanding. The Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement also provides for mandatory prepayments, including a customary excess cash flow sweep if certain conditions as prescribed in the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement therein are met. As of December 31, 2023, the Existing Term Loan B Facility has an aggregate principal amount of €507 million ($560 million) outstanding (the “TLB Stub”).

Morgan SE as the administrative agent and Lloyds Bank plc, acting as the collateral agent, and the lenders named therein for Term Loan A Facilities, Term Loan B Facilities and a multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of £1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2023, we have an outstanding balance of: (i) $1.3 billion (£1.03 billion) under our GBP Term Loan A Facility, which matures in July 2028 (subject to an automatic maturity extension to November 2028 following the repayment of the TLB Stub in full); (ii) $419 million (€380 million) under our EUR Term Loan A Facility, which matures in July 2028 (subject to an automatic maturity extension to November 2028 following the repayment of the TLB Stub in full); (iii) $166 million under our USD Term Loan A Facility, which matures in July 2028 (subject to an automatic maturity extension to November 2028 following the repayment of the TLB Stub in full) and (iv) $3.4 billion under our Term Loan B Facility which matures in November 2030. In March 2024, we entered into the Assumption Agreement under which we obtained a fungible incremental term loan which increased the aggregate principal amount of Term Loan B Facility by $514 million. The incremental term loan was used to refinance the 2028 USD Term Loan B Facility incurred by us pursuant to the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement. An amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount of Term Loan B Facility outstanding on November 30, 2023 amounting to $3.4 billion and the Incremental TLB Facility outstanding on March 14, 2024 amounting to $514 million is repayable in quarterly installments with the balance due on maturity. The entire principal of the Term Loan A Facilities and the principal are repayable at maturity. The GBP Term Loan A Facility has an interest rate of SONIA plus a margin of 1.75% with a SONIA floor of 0%. The EUR Term Loan A Facility has an interest rate of EURIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% with a EURIBOR floor of 0%. The USD Term Loan A Facility has an interest rate of daily compound SOFR plus 0.10% plus a margin of 1.75% with a SOFR floor of 0%. The Term Loan B Facility has an interest rate of (x) ABR (provided that in no event shall such ABR rate with respect to the First Incremental Term B Loans be less than 1.00% per annum) plus an applicable margin equal to 1.25% (or 1.00% upon the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio decreasing to 2.55:1 or below) or (y) Adjusted Term SOFR (provided that in no event shall such Adjusted Term SOFR rate with respect to the First Incremental Term B Loans be less than 0.50%) plus an applicable margin equal to 2.25% (or 2.00% upon the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio decreasing to 2.55:1 or below). Interest on each of the facilities is payable on the last day of each interest period. Facilities drawn down may be prepaid at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty on three business days’ (or such shorter period as the administrative agent may agree) prior notice (but, if in part, by a minimum of $1 million or its currency equivalent). The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issuance of letters of credit and/or the establishment of ancillary facilities with lenders on a bilateral basis. Each cash advance under the Revolving Credit Facility is to be repaid in full on the maturity date being July 2028 (subject to an automatic maturity extension to November 2028 following the repayment of the TLB Stub in full). Amounts repaid may be re-borrowed. A commitment fee of 35% of the margin then applicable on the available undrawn commitment is payable quarterly in arrears during the availability period, or on the last day of the availability period, which is one month prior to the maturity date. A utilization fee is also payable in the range of 0.00% to 0.30% per annum based on the proportion of revolving credit facility loans to the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments. The utilization fee accrues from day to day and is payable in arrears on the last day of each successive period of three months that ends during the availability period. For the period ending December 31, 2023, we had an outstanding 101 ----- principal amount of $736 million (£578 million).

Such price is subject to a 5% annual compounding carrying value adjustment. Fox has until December 2030 to exercise the Fox Option. Cash payment is required at the time of exercise and the Fox Option can only be exercised in full. Exercise of the Fox Option requires Fox to be licensed and should Fox not exercise within this timeframe, the Fox Option shall lapse. The Fox Option is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Fox Option amounts to $400 million and $220 million, respectively, which was determined using an option pricing model. Our use of the option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility of the price of investor units in FanDuel, the discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”), the discount for lack of control (“DLOC”), and the probability of a market participant getting licensed. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management’s best estimates. Changes in assumptions, each in isolation, may change the fair value of the Fox Option. Generally, a decrease in the equity value of the investor units, volatility and the probability of FOX getting licensed and an increase in DLOM and DLOC may result in a decrease in the fair value of the Fox Option. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of the Fox Option Liability, the fair value of the Fox Option Liability may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Fox Option Liability may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for FanDuel. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the Fox Option may cause the losses ultimately realized on the Fox Option to be different than the unrealized losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. Please see “Note 20. Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. The range in fair value as of December 31, 2023, is $100 million to $1,125 million, assuming a 10 percent increase/decrease in the equity value of the investor units and using the upper and lower end of the ranges of volatility, DLOC and DLOM, as disclosed in note 20 to the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2339,U.S.,2339.46,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,2339.46.2,Valuation of Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination,"The accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for an acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to identifiable assets, including intangible assets. Valuations are performed by independent valuation specialists under management’s supervision. We use various recognized valuation methods including present value modelling. Significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired trademarks, technology, customer relationships, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets, including expected revenue growth rates, estimated royalty rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates. The fair value of the acquired trade name and technology is generally estimated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name and technology. Assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the trade name and technology to estimate the royalty savings. The fair value of customer relationships is estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as trade name, technology and working capital that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. The resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the primary asset acquired, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. The fair value of licenses (lottery gaming and betting concessions) was estimated using the replacement cost method. The replacement cost is based on estimates of current cost of renewing the existing concessions and is compared to amounts paid for similar assets in market transactions for consistency. Please see “Note 12. Business Combinations and Disposals” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. We believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that a marketplace participant would use. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, 104 ----- we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2339,U.S.,2339.46,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,2339.46.3,Goodwill,"We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Our four reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. We may first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis of determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test or unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The qualitative assessment includes, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, our financial performances and other events, such as changes in our management and strategy. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Under the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we measure the fair value of the reporting units. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the valuation of the respective reporting unit is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model that requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry- specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. Within the discounted cash flow models, we use a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. We also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization. Depending upon the results of that measurement, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value may be required to be recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill will be written down to fair value. In the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023, based on the qualitative goodwill impairment test performed for the year ended December 31, 2023, we have determined that the goodwill of U.S., UKI and Australia were not impaired. For International, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The result of this test indicated its fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value, with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value as a percentage being 22%. We continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting unit’s fair value as appropriate.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2339,U.S.,2339.46,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,2339.46.4,Impairment of PokerStars Acquired Intangible Assets,"In the fourth quarter of 2023, PokerStars undertook a strategy and operational model assessment aimed at maximizing the value of PokerStars’ proprietary poker assets, by efficiently leveraging the existing technology solutions and marketing resources across the Group and unlocking synergies with other Flutter brands in their existing markets to deliver sustainable growth consistent with our International segment strategy to combine global scale with local presence. A decision was made in December 2023 to move away from the existing capital intensive PokerStars technology in order to improve efficiency and performance of the business by leveraging technology and marketing resources across the Group, thereby unlocking synergies with other Flutter brands. This decision led the Group to revaluate its asset grouping of PokerStars’ acquired intangible assets. In determining the asset grouping, we assessed the revenue dependency and level of shared costs between assets. As a result of the change in strategy and operational model, we concluded that the acquired intangible assets representing customer relations should now be allocated to four distinct asset groups. Prior to the change in strategy and operational model, the acquired intangibles were included in a single asset group. The PokerStars trademark was not allocated to any of the four distinct asset groups as it is able to generate identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities under the new strategy and operational model. We performed a qualitative assessment on the four asset groups and PokerStars trademark, considering historical performance, market outlook and updates to future operating plans, to determine if there was any 105 ----- triggering event for impairment testing arising from the change in the strategy and operational model. Based on this assessment, we concluded that there were triggering events for impairment testing for both the trademark and the customer relationships allocated to an asset group comprising global shared poker liquidity markets. After performing a recoverability test, we concluded that the carrying amount of this asset group is recoverable with the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group exceeding its carrying amount by 94% as of December 31, 2023. The carrying amount of the PokerStars trademark was determined to be not recoverable as it exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use, which reflected the impact of lower projected royalty revenue consequent to the decision to change the strategy and operational model, and therefore an impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the PokerStars trademark exceeded its fair value. In measuring the impairment loss of PokerStars trademark, we utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value. Assumptions inherent in estimating the fair value include revenue forecast, royalty rate of 5.0%, income tax rate of 12.5%, and discount rate of 12.5%. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates. Financial forecasts beyond the period covered by the plans were estimated by extrapolating the projections based on the plans using a steady growth in line with the long-term average growth for the countries in which the trademark is used. As detailed in “Note 11. Intangible Assets, Net” of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum, we recorded an impairment loss of $725 million related to PokerStars trademark. We considered the royalty rate and discount rate used to estimate the fair value of PokerStars trademark are most material assumptions. The range in fair value as of December 31, 2023, is $337 million to $533 million, assuming a 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and 250-basis-point increase in the royalty rate.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

A change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of functional currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction. That increase or decrease in expected functional currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss and is included in determining net loss for the period in which the exchange rate changes. To minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s results, the Group looks to match foreign currency denominated liabilities with foreign currency denominated assets where possible. For the Group’s material currencies and where cost effective to do so, we seek to mitigate the impact of changes in currency rates by borrowing centrally in foreign currency denominated debt (after considering the impact of hedging arrangements) in the same proportion as the cash flow earned by our foreign operations in those currencies, thus ensuring the foreign currency denominated debt is repaid with receipts from foreign currency earnings. Subject to operating within limits stipulated in our treasury policies, and, above these limits, with the Treasury Committee approval, we may use forward contracts and other derivative instruments as permitted by our treasury policies to reduce foreign currency exposure. Surplus net foreign currency inflows are predominantly sold at spot rates. We are also exposed to the net investment in our foreign operations which are primarily in EUR, AUD and USD. Such an exposure is a result of the translation of the net investment into the parent’s functional currency. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the GBP, will negatively affect our revenue gross and operating profits as expressed in GBP.

As of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, the Company had outstanding floating rate long term debt with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $3,185 million and $4,628 million, respectively. We may in the future enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument.

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Our Business,17.1.1,,"Flutter is the world’s largest online sports betting and iGaming operator based on revenue. Our ambition is to change our industry for the better and deliver long-term growth while also achieving a positive, sustainable future for all our stakeholders. We are well-placed to do so through the global competitive advantages of the _Flutter Edge, which provides our brands with access to group-wide benefits to stay ahead of the competition,_ while maintaining a clear vision for sustainability through our Positive Impact Plan. We are the industry leader by size with 12.3 million AMPs and $11,790 million of revenue globally for the year ended December 31, 2023. See “—Key Operational Metrics” below for additional information regarding how we calculate AMPs data, including a discussion regarding duplication of players that exists in such data. We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the future long-term growth of the markets we operate in, through our financial growth engine. This is built on: - **Sustainable revenue growth: We seek to expand the Group’s player base and grow player value through product innovation and efficient generosity spend. We believe that there are significant revenue growth opportunities for both our U.S. and ex-U.S. businesses. As more U.S. states have legalized sports betting and iGaming, our U.S. business has grown revenue by 134.2%, from $1,915 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $4,484 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding the U.S. business, we have grown revenue by 14.3%, from $6,393 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $7,306 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the benefit of acquisitions during that period, and we believe that our International “Consolidate and _Invest” markets, which include Italy, Spain, Georgia, Armenia, Brazil, India and Turkey, provide_ the platform for continued high levels of future growth. - **Margin benefits:** We seek to increase the efficiency of our marketing investment and operating leverage to deliver high net income margins and Adjusted EBITDA Margins. The Group’s net income (loss) margins and Adjusted EBITDA Margins have been negatively impacted in recent years by significant investments in marketing and customer acquisition in the U.S. division. As we deliver against our U.S. strategy, the net income (loss) margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin of the U.S. division have improved and we expect this trajectory to continue and drive further improvement in our consolidated net income (loss) margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin over time. - **Significant cashflow generation: Although recent acquisitions have resulted in increased long-term debt, we believe that the low levels of capital intensity due to the scalable nature of our technology platforms, and positive working capital from our expanding business, will permit us to reduce our leverage ratio over time. As of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had total long-term debt of $7,056 million and $6,750 million, respectively. - **Disciplined capital allocation: We expect to drive long-term earnings per share growth and long- term value creation through disciplined capital allocation: (i) **Disciplined organic investment: We believe that our player acquisition cost, lifetime value and player relationship management models and algorithms provide a disciplined evaluation framework enabling high returns from our investment in player growth and retention. (ii) **Value creative M&A:** We have clear criteria for acquiring bolt-on, “local-hero” brands, with podium (i.e. top-three) positions in high-growth markets. These local 77 ----- heroes are then complemented in the post-acquisition period by the benefits of the _Flutter Edge. Our acquisitions of FanDuel, Adjarabet, Junglee Games, tombola and_ Sisal are examples of this strategy. We believe that there remains significant further M&A potential to add market-leading businesses in regulated markets where the Group does not currently have a presence. (iii) **Returns to shareholders: We expect that the Group’s projected cash generation will permit us to reduce our leverage ratio over time and provide significant future balance sheet capacity. Although we do not currently have any specific plans to pay dividends or engage in significant share repurchases, once we have optimized our leverage, we intend to return to shareholders capital that cannot be effectively deployed through organic investment or value creative M&A. We had a net loss per share of $(5.24), $(2.44) and $(6.89) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The combination of margin benefits, cashflow generation and disciplined capital allocation is expected to drive earnings per share growth and long-term value creation.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

For the year ended December 31, 2023, 55.9% of our revenue was derived from sportsbook, 39.2% of our revenue was derived from iGaming and 5.0% of our revenue was derived from other products, while 90.1% of our revenue at the Group level was generated from our online businesses. Our online operations are complemented by our 702 retail shops in Armenia, Georgia, Italy, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Through our acquisition of MaxBet in January 2024, we operate an additional 463 retail shops in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, as of March 26, 2024. In each market, we typically offer sports betting, iGaming, or both, depending on the regulatory conditions of that market. We operate a divisional management and operating structure across our geographic markets. Each division has an empowered management team responsible for maintaining the momentum and growth in their respective geographic markets. Our divisions are: (i) U.S., (ii) UKI, (iii) Australia and (iv) International, which align with our four reportable segments which consist of: (i) **U.S.: Our U.S. division offers sports betting, casino, DFS and horse racing wagering products to players across various states in the United States, mainly online but with sports betting services also provided through a small number of retail outlets, and certain online products in the province of Ontario in Canada. The U.S. division is our fastest growing and our largest division, constituting $4,484 million (or 38.0%) of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, we had a 37% market share, consisting of a 43.2% share of the online sports betting market in the states where FanDuel sportsbook was live and a 25.7% share of the iGaming market in states where FanDuel casino and PokerStars (U.S.) were live. The U.S. division consists of the following brands: FanDuel, TVG and PokerStars (U.S.). As of December 31, 2023, our FanDuel online sportsbook was available in 20 states (Vermont and North Carolina were added in the three months ended March 31, 2024), our FanDuel online casino was available in 5 states, our FanDuel paid DFS offering was available in 44 states, our FanDuel or TVG online horse racing wagering product was available in 32 states, our FanDuel free-to-play products were available in all 50 states and our PokerStars (U.S.) iGaming product was available in three states. (ii) **UKI:** In the United Kingdom and Ireland, we offer sports betting (sportsbook), iGaming products (games, casino, bingo and poker) and other products (exchange betting) through our Sky Betting & Gaming, Paddy Power, Betfair and tombola brands. Although our UKI brands mostly operate online, this division also includes our 576 Paddy Power betting shops in the United Kingdom and Ireland as of December 31, 2023. Our UKI division constituted $3,047 million (or 25.8%) of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. 78 ----- (iii) **Australia: In Australia, we offer online sports betting products through our Sportsbet brand, which operates exclusively in Australia and offers a wide range of betting products and experiences across local and global horse racing, sports, entertainment and major events. Our Australia division constituted $1,447 million (or 12.3%) of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. (iv) **International: Our International division includes our operations in over 100 global markets and offers sports betting, casino, poker, rummy and lottery, mainly online. Sisal, the leading iGaming operator in Italy, is the largest brand in the International division following its acquisition in August 2022. The International division also includes PokerStars, Betfair International, Adjarabet and Junglee Games. We continue to diversify internationally and are taking our online offering into regulated markets with a strong gambling culture and a competitive tax framework under which we have the ability to offer a broad betting and iGaming product range. In January 2024, we acquired an initial 51% controlling stake in MaxBet, a leading omni-channel sports betting and gaming operator in Serbia, creating an opportunity to accelerate growth and deliver a gold medal position in the Balkans region. Our International division constituted $2,812 million (or 23.9%) of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Non-GAAP Measures,17.4.1,,"We report our financial results in this Offering Memorandum in accordance with U.S. GAAP; however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information to supplement our financial operating performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, both on a Groupwide basis and on a segment basis, provide visibility to the performance of our business by excluding the impact of certain income or gains and expenses or losses. Additionally, we believe these metrics are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and others in our industry in evaluating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are not liquidity measures and should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or to distribute to shareholders or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and not rely on a single financial measure to evaluate our business. We also strongly urge you to review the reconciliations between our most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP measures and our non-GAAP measures set forth in “—Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Operational Metrics,17.5.1,,"Average Monthly Players (“AMPs”) is defined as the average over the applicable reporting period of the total number of players who have placed and/or wagered a stake and/or contributed to rake or tournament fees during the month. This measure does not include individuals who have only used new player or player retention incentives, and this measure is for online players only and excludes retail player activity. We present AMPs for each of our product categories, for each of our divisions and for the consolidated Group as a whole as we believe this provides useful information for assessing underlying trends. At the product category level, a player is generally counted as one AMP for each product category they use. In circumstances where a player uses multiple product categories within one brand, we are generally able to identify that it is the same player who is using multiple product categories and therefore count this player as only one AMP at each of 79 ----- the division and Group levels while also counting this player as one AMP for each separate product category that the player is using. For example, a player who uses FanDuel Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category and FanDuel Casino in the iGaming product category, in each case within the U.S. division, would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the sportsbook product category and the iGaming product category but only as one AMP for the U.S. division and one AMP for the Group as a whole. As a result, the sum of the AMPs presented at the product category level in each of our U.S., UKI and International divisions, where we offer multiple product categories (and in contrast to our Australia division, where we only offer our sportsbook product category), is greater than the total AMPs presented at the division level. For example, we reported within our U.S. division for the year ended December 31, 2023, AMPs of 2.6 million for our sportsbook product category, AMPs of 0.6 million for our iGaming product category and AMPs of 0.5 million for our other product category, while reporting AMPs for our U.S. division of 3.2 million (which figure is lower than the sum of 3.7 million that would be calculated by adding AMPs presented at the product category levels). Because the AMPs we present for the consolidated Group as a whole simply represent the sum of the AMPs we present for each of our four divisions, the sum of the AMPs we present for each of our product categories at the Group level will also exceed the total AMPs we present for the consolidated Group as a whole. Notwithstanding the methodology described in the immediately preceding paragraph, our AMPs information is based on player data collected by each of our brands, which generally each employ their own unique data platform, and reflects a level of duplication that arises from individuals who use multiple brands. More specifically, we are generally unable to identify when the same individual player is using multiple brands and therefore count this player multiple times. For example, a player who uses Sky Betting & Gaming Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category and Paddy Power Casino in the iGaming product category, in each case within the UKI division, would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the sportsbook product category and the iGaming product category; however, this player would also count as two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the UKI division and two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the Group as a whole. In addition, a player who uses Sky Betting & Gaming Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category and Paddy Power Sportsbook in the sportsbook product category, in each case within the UKI division, would count as two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the sportsbook product category, two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the UKI division and two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the Group as a whole. We are unable to quantify the level of duplication that arises as a result of these circumstances, but do not believe it to be material and note that it arises primarily in our UKI division, where we offer multiple successful brands within multiple product categories, but where we believe that most players tend to utilize only one brand given each brand has its own separate registration system and player platform. In addition to the duplication that arises when the same individual player is using multiple brands as described in the immediately preceding paragraph, we do not eliminate from the AMPs information presented for the Group as a whole duplication of individual players who use our product offerings in multiple divisions. For example, a player who uses Betfair Casino in the iGaming product category within the UKI division and Betfair Exchange in the other product category within the International division would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the iGaming product category and the other product category and would appropriately count as one AMP for each of the UKI division and the International division; however, this player would count as two AMPs (rather than one AMP) for the Group as a whole. We are unable to quantify the level of duplication that arises as a result of these circumstances, but do not believe it to be material and note that players must demonstrate residency within the geography covered by a division to sign up for an account, and accordingly such duplication could only arise in the circumstance of an individual player having multiple residences across different divisions. We do not believe that the existence of player duplication as described in the previous two paragraphs undercuts the meaningfulness of the AMPs data that we present for assessing underlying trends in our business, and our management uses this AMPs data for this purpose. Stakes represent the total amount our players wagered in sportsbook and is a key volume indicator for our sportsbook products. The variability of sporting outcomes can result in an impact to sportsbook revenue that may obscure underlying trends in the sportsbook business relating to growth in amounts wagered and, accordingly, staking data can provide additional useful information. We do not utilize staking information to track performance of our iGaming products. Because our iGaming business is not subject to the same variability in outcomes, management is able to assess trends in our iGaming business by analyzing AMPs and revenue changes, without the need to collect or analyze stakes and believes that collecting and analyzing stakes data in our iGaming business would not provide meaningful incremental information regarding trends in such business that is not already provided by collecting and analyzing our iGaming AMPs and revenue data. 80 ----- Sportsbook Net Revenue Margin is defined as sportsbook revenue as a percentage of the amount staked. This is a key indicator for measuring the combined impact of our overall margin on sportsbook products and levels of bonusing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

This approach is consistent with our business strategy of investing to build leadership positions in regulated markets globally. We intend to continue to make similar investments in the future in attractive, fast-growing markets where growing our business organically is typically slower or more difficult to achieve. For example, in January 2024, we acquired an initial 51.0% controlling stake in MaxBet, a leading omni-channel sports betting and gaming operator in Serbia. These acquisitions and disposals affect various aspects of our results of operations and either increase or decrease our results of operations for the periods in which their results are combined with (or removed from) our consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions, in particular, can involve significant investments to integrate the business of the acquired company with our business, and such costs may vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, the impact of acquisitions and divestments may result in our financial information for such periods being less comparable to, or not being comparable at all, to prior financial periods. The acquisitions and disposals that we completed in the periods under discussion are noted below: - On August 4, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Sisal, Italy’s leading iGaming operator, from CVC Capital Partners Fund VI for cash consideration of $2,037 million. - On July 1, 2022, we acquired the remaining 49.0% stake in Adjarabet, one of the largest iGaming operators in the regulated Georgian market, for consideration of $251 million, bringing our holding in Adjarabet to 100%, an increase from our previous controlling interest of 51.0%, which we acquired in February 2019. - On January 10, 2022, we acquired tombola, one of the leading online bingo operators in the UK market. The purchase comprised of a cash payment of $557 million. - On September 10, 2021, we acquired a 100% stake in Singular, a European sports betting and gaming technology platform, for consideration of $44 million (in cash, contingent consideration and deferred consideration). - On August 31, 2021, we sold our entire shareholding in Oddschecker Global Media, our odds comparison website, to Bruin Capital for cash consideration of $175 million. - On January 28, 2021, we acquired an initial 50.1% controlling stake in Junglee Games, an Indian online rummy operator, for consideration of $67 million (in cash and deferred consideration). In June 2021, we exercised an option to acquire an additional 7.2% stake for a consideration of $8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022 we exchanged a 5.0% equity stake in a subsidiary of Junglee Games for the acquisition of 100% of Sachiko Gaming Private Limited, an online poker gaming developer based in India, with options to acquire the 5.0% equity stake in 2027 and/or 2032 or in the event of a liquidation event relating to Junglee Games.

For example, in the U.S., we launched our online sportsbook products in New York, Louisiana, Wyoming, Kansas and Maryland in 2022 and Ohio and Massachusetts in 2023, following the recent relaxation of state regulations. The regulatory environment can, however, also place limitations on the online and offline marketing channels or alter the way in which players engage with our products in certain markets. For example, in Italy, an “advertising ban” has been in force since the beginning of 2019. This included a complete ban on direct and indirect advertising, sponsorship, the use of “influencers” and all other forms of communications with promotional content relating to games or betting with cash winnings. Also, in UKI, regulatory changes and safer gambling initiatives being introduced by operators are also leading to slower market growth.

Our main revenue streams are as below. _Sportsbook_ Sportsbook involves the player placing a bet (wager) on various types of sporting events at fixed odds determined by the Group. Bets are made in advance of the sporting event that will determine the outcome of the wager. The player places their bet in the custody of the Group until the event occurs and the result of the sporting event is determined. Our revenue represents the net win or loss from the outcome of a sporting event, net of new player incentives and player retention incentives. 82 ----- _iGaming_ iGaming consists of a full suite of casino games, such as roulette, blackjack, slot games, bingo and rummy, along with poker and lottery products. Casino games involve players placing wagers to play an online game against the Group.

See “—Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures” for additional information about these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. _Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022_ Our total revenue grew 24.6%, to $11,790 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The growth was mainly driven by continued expansion of our player base, with AMPs up 20.3% to 12.3 million and AMP growth across all segments. Our U.S. segment was a key driver of this growth, with revenue 40.7% higher year on year despite the impact of adverse sports results. Sports results are calculated as the difference between our expected net revenue margin for the period and our actual net revenue margin, which were particularly pronounced in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and had an approximately 7.8 percentage point growth impact. Revenue growth outside of the U.S. of 16.4% year on year was partly driven by strong growth in UKI and in our “Consolidate and Invest” markets within International. We also benefited from the full year consolidation of the Sisal business acquired during 2022, which generated $1,218 million of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023 and added 7.1 percentage points to Group revenue growth. On a pro forma basis, including Sisal as if it were consolidated for the entirely of both 2022 and 2023, Group revenue grew 17.2% compared with the prior year. This was partly offset by a decrease in revenue in our Australia segment, particularly in racing due to a reduced level of player engagement following easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Cost of sales increased by 28.9% to $6,202 million or by 170 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 52.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the annualization of point of consumption tax rate changes in Australia which were increased during the second half of 2022. Technology, research and development expenses increased by 38.6%, to $765 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the full year consolidation of Sisal and continued investment in product development to enhance the customer proposition of our brands across the Group, and particularly for FanDuel in our U.S. segment. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 25.3% to $3,776 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an impairment loss of $725 million related to PokerStars’ trademark. This reflects the changes we are implementing to optimize the PokerStars business model such as focused investment in our “Consolidate and Invest” markets while reducing sales and marketing expense in our “Optimize and Maintain” markets. The sales and marketing expense increase also included disciplined investment in the continued expansion of our footprint across the U.S. and in our UKI segment to drive market share gains. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue of 32.0% increased by 20 basis points compared with the year ended December 31, 2022 as the impact of the impairment loss offset the efficiencies delivered across our business as a 85 ----- result of (i) a greater proportion of our revenue coming from existing states in the U.S. where the proportionate levels of marketing spend are lower, as well as the benefit from the efficiencies of national advertising; (ii) a more personalized approach to spend within UKI; and (iii) more targeted investment in our International segment. General and administrative expenses increased by 36.1% to $1,596 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily as a result of (i) the continued expansion of our U.S. business; (ii) the full year consolidation of the Sisal business acquired during 2022; and (iii) an increase in corporate overhead due to greater investment in Group resource, technology, and research and development initiatives. The increase also reflects fees associated with the U.S. listing of Flutter shares of $86 million and the Fox Option arbitration proceedings of $30 million. Operating profit declined by $461 million to $549 million, primarily due to the impairment loss of $725 million relating to the PokerStars trademark which more than offset the strong revenue growth across the Group during the year. Other expense increased by $162 million from an income in the year ended December 31, 2022 of $5 million to an expense in the year ended December 31, 2023 of $157 million. This increase was primarily driven by (i) the impact of a fair value loss on the Fox Option Liability in the year ended December 31, 2023 of $165 million, when compared with a gain of $83 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and (ii) an increase of $145 million related to the fair value gain on derivative instruments to $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, from $152 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in expense was partly offset by a reduction in expense related to the recognition of a foreign exchange gain of $43 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with a loss of $162 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest expense, net increased by $173 million to $385 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in long-term debt associated with the acquisition of Sisal, along with a higher cost of servicing existing debt during the year. Income tax expense increased by $45 million to $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The movement is primarily due to the change in the mix of profits in the jurisdictions in which the Group has a taxable presence as well as the tax effect of acquisition related intangible assets and internal intangible asset transfers. Net loss increased by $841 million to a net loss of $1,211 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the impairment loss of $725 million which more than offset the strong revenue growth across the Group during the year, while net loss margin increased by 640 basis points to 10.3% as a result of the factors above. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 47.2% to $1,679 million and Further Adjusted EBITDA increased by 45.6% to $1,875 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflecting the revenue performance and cost trends outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 210 basis points from 12.1% to 14.2% and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 230 basis points from 13.6% to 15.9% primarily due to (i) a reduction in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue of 480 basis points for the Group driven by a greater proportion of our revenue coming from existing states in the U.S. division, where the proportionate levels of marketing spend are lower than in new states; and (ii) economies of scale driven by expansion into new states in the U.S. These were partially offset by the impact of the annualization of point of consumption tax rate increases in Australia which came into effect during the second half of 2022. _Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021_ Our total revenue grew 13.9% to $9,463 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth was mainly driven by continued expansion of our player base, with AMPs up 25.8% to 10.2 million. Our rapidly scaling U.S. segment was a key driver of this growth, with revenue 66.4% higher year on year. Revenue outside of the U.S. declined 1.8% year on year reflecting (i) the impact of disruption to our International business in Russia and Ukraine due to the ongoing conflict in the region and (ii) decrease in revenue in our Australia segment due to reduced level of player engagement following easing of COVID-19 restrictions and a highly competitive trading environment with new brands entering the market. These were mostly offset by the benefit from our acquisitions of Sisal in the International segment and tombola in the UKI segment during the year ended December 31, 2022. 86 ----- Cost of sales increased by 24.0% to $4,813 million or by 420 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the launch of our operations in New York State, where gaming taxes are higher, as well as an increase in point of consumption tax rates in Australia during the second half of 2022. Technology, research and development expenses decreased by 12.9% to $552 million primarily driven by the higher share-based payment charge in the year ended December 31, 2021 following a modification of the FanDuel Group Value Creation Plan (“VCP”) in the U.S. division. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 6.9%, to $3,014 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to (i) continued expansion of our footprint across the U.S.; (ii) ongoing investment in our “Consolidate _and Invest” markets in International; and (iii) additional amortization in relation to Sisal’s brand and player_ relationships. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 33.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of (i) a greater proportion of our revenue coming from states where we have an existing presence in the U.S. where the proportionate levels of marketing spend are lower, as well as expansion of our footprint across the U.S. which enabled us to benefit from the efficiencies of national advertising; (ii) the realization of efficiencies in marketing spend within UKI; and (iii) lower level of sales and marketing expenses in Sisal compared with the rest of the Group due to the advertising ban in the Italian market. General and administrative expenses decreased by 17.6%, to $1,172 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily as a result of (i) the legal settlement together with associated legal costs amounting $223 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2021 when Flutter settled the legal dispute with the Commonwealth of Kentucky and (ii) a significant incremental share-based payment charge in 2021 following a modification of the VCP in the U.S. division. This is partially offset by (i) the continued expansion of our footprint across the U.S. and (ii) the acquisition of Sisal. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by economies of scale in the U.S. Operating loss decreased by $361 million to a loss of $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from a loss of $449 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the factors above. Other income, net decreased by $96 million to $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily because of a loss on settlement of longterm debt of $65 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with a gain of $130 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, together with a foreign exchange loss of $162 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a loss of $86 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, offset by a fair value gain on the Fox Option of $83 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a loss of $71 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and by a fair value gain on derivative instruments of $152 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with a gain of $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense, net decreased by $3 million to $212 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Income tax expense decreased by $119 million to $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The movement reflected the increase of tax credit of $135 million arising primarily from the tax effect of acquisition-related intangible amortization and the recognition of a deferred tax asset following an internal transfer of intangible assets. This was partly offset by the increase in current tax charge due to increased profit and changes in statutory tax rates in certain jurisdictions. Net loss decreased $387 million to $370 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $757 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of the factors above. Net loss margin decreased from 9.1% to 3.9%, which was primarily due to (i) a greater proportion of our revenue coming from states where we have an existing presence in the U.S. division, where the proportionate levels of marketing spend are lower than in new states; (ii) economies of scale within general and administrative expenses driven by expansion into new states in the United States; (iii) a significant incremental share-based payment charge in 2021 following a modification of the VCP in the U.S. division; (iv) a fair value gain on the Fox Option of $83 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a loss of $71 million in the year ended December 31, 2021; and (v) a decrease in income tax charge of $119 million, mainly driven by a tax credit of $135 million arising primarily from the tax effect of acquisition-related intangible amortization and the recognition of a deferred tax asset following an internal transfer of intangible assets. These were partially offset by a loss on settlement of long-term debt of $65 million in the 87 ----- year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with a gain of $130 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, together with an increase in foreign exchange loss of $76 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 28.8% to $1,141 million, reflecting the revenue performance and cost trends outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased 140 basis points to 12.1%, primarily due to (i) a greater proportion of our revenue coming from states where we have an existing presence in the U.S. division, where the proportionate levels of marketing spend are lower than in new states; (ii) economies of scale within general and administrative expenses driven by expansion into new states in the U.S.; and (iii) a significant incremental share-based payment charge in the year ended December 31, 2021 following a modification of the VCP in the U.S. division offset by the impact of disruption to our International business in Russia and Ukraine due to the ongoing conflict in the region and an increase in point of consumption tax rates in Australia during the second half of 2022. Further Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 6.0% to $1,288 million for 2022 and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased 290 basis points from 16.5% to 13.6%. This reflects all the items noted above but excludes the impact of the lower share-based payment charge, including a significant incremental sharebased payment charge in 2021 following a modification of the VCP in the U.S. division.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The market remained resilient during the global financial crisis (“GFC”), with a growth rate of 2.7% YoY in 2008 and 0.7% YoY in 2009, and a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.6% for the period between 2007 and 2023. While the response to COVID-19 led to the closure of the gaming retail venues and interruption of operations in the global betting and gaming industry in 2020 and 2021, it also accelerated the migration toward online betting and gaming channels from land-based channels. In 2019, the online betting and gaming segment accounted for 15% of the global betting and gaming market in terms of GGR and it is expected to account for 26% in 2024 ($151.9 billion of the total $582.2 billion global betting and gaming market), with significant potential for future growth according to H2GC. The global online betting and gaming market is currently expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.9% between 2024 and 2028, primarily driven by further migration to online channels and the increase in the number of regulated markets across the world.

Outside of the United States, there is also a long runway for high growth. According to H2GC, the global betting and gaming market ex-US reached $384.3 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $413.0 billion in 2024 with 30% online penetration. For the period between 2024 and 2028, the market ex-US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% while the online GGR is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.2% for the same period. Excluding the UK & Ireland and Australia, the global betting and gaming market ex-US for the rest of world reached $338.6 billion in 2023, of which only $172 billion is in regulated or regulating markets as of today, representing a significant untapped regulated market. The consistent historical growth and strong momentum of the global betting and gaming market have been driven by a number of key factors: - _Channel migration: Prior to COVID-19, the ex-US online betting and gaming market grew at a CAGR of 13.8% from 2007 to 2019 and 2.4% for the land-based betting and gaming during the same period. The global betting and gaming sector was transitioning toward omni-channel platforms from primarily land-based channels historically, driven by the structural shift in consumer preference towards online betting and gaming, as observed in other consumer-facing sectors. The online migration was further accelerated during COVID-19 as retail venues were temporarily closed and consumers substituted online alternatives. - _New regulated and regulating markets:_ There has been significant development towards regulation across key markets, such as Brazil, Canada, as well as the continued opening of new states in the United Stated for betting and gaming since 2018. Notably, on December 29, 2023, a new regulatory framework for sports betting and iGaming in Brazil was approved. Such constructive regulatory developments provide existing betting and gaming operators with access to new markets and customers and the prospect of more sustainable revenue growth once such markets are fully regulated. While regulation creates additional overheads, startup costs and gaming taxes for operators, it makes it more difficult for new market entrants and creates the significant opportunity for the leading existing operators that can utilize their existing market position, scale, and experience to successfully setup operations in new markets. - _New product and technology development: Increasing high-speed internet access and the growth of smart phone usage have spurred demand for more sophisticated and appealing online games. Based on technological advancements, operators continue to invest in the new digital products that offer more engaging and higher-quality gaming experiences for customers. Differentiated product offerings that are intentionally designed for online platforms have become crucial for operators to acquire and retain new customers. - _Increasing recreational customer base:_ The global customer base is becoming more focused on recreational betting and gaming. Betting and gaming have also gained broader recognition as culturally acceptable leisure activities, supported by a broader digital offering, more recreational games and increasingly accessible platforms on mobile phones and the internet. - _Sector consolidation:_ In recent years, gaming operators have actively consolidated their market position through acquisitions, driven in part by the economies of scale and the benefits of diversification. The overlapping cost base from marketing, content development and purchasing, as well as investment in technology, can be effectively reduced, while revenue synergies can be achieved through cross-selling of products across an enlarged customer base. In addition, geographic diversification allows operators to mitigate the exposure to a single regulatory and tax regime, and the diversification across channels allows to cross-sell products across both land-based and online channels.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The UK government’s review of the UK Gambling Act is extensive in scope. Key areas under review include: - the effectiveness of the existing online protections in preventing gambling harm and an evidence-based consideration of, for example, imposing greater control on online product design such as stake, speed and prize limits, and the introduction of deposit, loss and spend limits; - the benefits or harms caused by allowing licensed gambling operators to advertise and make promotional offers and the positive or negative impact of gambling sponsorship arrangements across sports, e-sports and other areas; - the effectiveness of the regulatory system currently in place, including consideration of whether the UKGC has sufficient investigative, enforcement and sanctioning powers both to regulate the licensed market and address the unlicensed market; - the availability and suitability of redress arrangements in place for an individual consumer who considers it may have been treated unfairly by a gambling operator, including consideration of the introduction of other routes for consumer redress, such as a gambling ombudsman; and - the effectiveness of current measures to prevent illegal underage gambling and consideration of what extra protections may be needed for young adults in the 18−25 age bracket. The call for evidence in connection with the review concluded in March 2021. On April 27, 2023, the UK government issued a white paper, which included proposals to: - hold a consultation to determine the maximum staking limit for online slot gaming products of between £2 and £15 per spin, with options of a £2 limit per stake, £4 limit per stake or an approach based on individual risk for 18-24 year-old players; - hold a consultation to determine whether to make player-set deposit limits mandatory or opt-out rather than opt-in; - introduce a statutory levy (as a percentage of revenue) requiring all licensed operators to make contributions to help fund research, education and treatment of gambling harms.; and - hold a consultation on imposing new obligations on licensed operators to conduct: - enhanced spending checks if a player loses £1,000 within one day or £2,000 within 90 days, with such thresholds halved for 18-24 year-old players; and - financial vulnerability checks if a player loses more than £125 within one month or £500 within one year. In line with its strategy to take a leadership role in responsible betting and gaming, Flutter has implemented a broad range of player protections over the last three years during the pendency of the UK government’s review of the UK Gambling Act. We estimate that these changes have resulted in a loss of £150 million in annual revenue from our UKI business and that the incremental revenue impact from the proposed measures announced in the white paper could be between £50 million and £100 million, resulting in a total cumulative revenue impact of between £200 million and £250 million of annual UKI revenue.

Between 2016 and 2023, the Australian online betting and gambling market grew at a CAGR of 10.5% based on GGR according to H2GC, with future growth rates expected to be dependent on: (i) the rate of retention of customers who have migrated to online betting and gaming channels from land-based betting and gaming channels and (ii) increase in new recreational customers that are avid sports fans who do not currently bet a bookmaker and who opt instead to place their sports bets online. In the recent years, the Australian market has benefitted from customer migration to online channels, accelerated by COVID-19 related restrictions in retail channels in 2020 and 2021, and the market also benefited from changes to consumer entertainment spend, as consumers substituted online alternatives for travel and leisure spend.

The Italian gambling market has historically seen significant progress in the liberalization of its regulatory framework, starting with the legalization of betting in 2007. In the past decade, the industry has further benefited from retail network modernization, new product and technology rollouts, an increase in the average pay-out, as well as stricter controls on illegal gambling operations and more emphasis on safe gambling. In recent years, the regulatory framework in Italy has tightened with an online advertising ban issued in 2019 as well as an increase in tax on gross win for sports betting and gaming. An additional tax on sports betting was introduced in 2020 by the Italian government that will be levied until the end of 2022 as part of COVID-19 recovery plans. In January 2024, the Italian government approved the terms of the Reorganisation Decree which will undertake the first regulatory evaluation of the Italian gambling market since its authorization in 2011. The Reorganisation Decree’s primary objectives are enhanced player protection, combating illegal gambling and increased tax revenue through a new licensing framework. However, compared to small operators, large omni-channel operators are less impacted by the recent regulatory changes due to less reliance on online advertising and the advantage of scale. In addition, the online gaming operators with retail outlets are particularly well positioned in Italy to benefit from the migration of customers to the market’s online channel as a significant proportion of deposits and withdrawals for online betting and gaming are conducted via retail networks in Italy and the ability to engage customers across both channels provides a distinct advantage.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The United States is our most significant market opportunity. FanDuel has continued to see positive legislative momentum, resulting in its online sportsbook being available in 20 U.S. states (Vermont and North Carolina were added in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024) and iGaming being available in five U.S. states as of the last twelve months ended November 30, 2023, representing 45.0% of the U.S. population and 11.5% of the U.S. population, respectively. We expect the total addressable market (“TAM”) for the United States to be greater than $40 billion by 2030 as a result of (i) the maturation of states with existing sports betting and gaming and (ii) the expansion of legalized sports betting and gaming to cover approximately 80% and 25% of the U.S. population, respectively. Our U.S. division saw its market share reach 37%, including an online sportsbook market share based on gross gaming revenue from online sportsbook of 43.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, or 53.4% based on net gaming revenue (based on data received from reporting states only). This 118 ----- leading market position was driven by efficient customer acquisition and retention, high-quality products and effective execution of our strategies, and it has enabled us to fully capitalize on our significant opportunity in the United States, as evidenced by our delivery of a positive US Adjusted EBITDA ($65 million) as well as positive US Further Adjusted EBITDA ($167 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Outside of the United States, we estimate that the total betting and gaming market was worth $384 billion in 2023, with 30% of this market occurring online. We also estimate that, of the $339 billion TAM outside of the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, $172 billion occurred in regulating or regulated markets, representing a significant opportunity for further growth internationally. We believe our scale and market leading positions in our online betting and gaming markets will enable us to (i) proactively prepare for new market openings and capture and consolidate market share, (ii) continue to benefit from the shift from in person to online betting and gaming and (iii) operate a resilient business model which we believe has allowed us to continue growing through regulatory changes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

We believe that the availability of this company-wide expertise, as and when our brands need it, provides us with a distinctive set of advantages. We devote substantial resources to delivering the best products to our customers. We devote significant capital expenditures in developing and maintaining our proprietary technology as well as to the employment of approximately 7,000 technologists, including approximately 3,200 software engineers, around the Group to which our brands have access. The benefits of our multi-decade investment are available to all our brands, ensuring we are driving market trends and strengthening our compelling customer proposition across the Group, while delivering the benefits of our global scale across each of our local brands. We believe that the market-leading pricing and risk management capabilities underpinning our sportsbook product innovations for each of our sportsbook businesses showcase the benefits of our 119 ----- investment in technology. For example, we first launched the “Same Game Multi” product in Australia and subsequently launched it in other markets around the globe, including as “Same Game Parlay” in the United States. We believe that our investment in technology underlies our competitive advantage in gaming as well. Our four in-house studios provide access to proprietary gaming content which is delivered across the Group to our gaming brands. We have also successfully utilized innovation in our UKI business to drive player engagement, including daily prize mechanics such as Sky Betting & Gaming’s “Prize Machine” and Paddy Power’s “Wonder Wheel.” These innovations have helped to drive gaming momentum, and we have deployed these successes in our other businesses as well, as demonstrated by the launch of the PokerStars “Spin of the Day” mechanic in 2022 and FanDuel’s Reward Machine in 2023. We share access to people and talent across our Group, ensuring our businesses utilize the sector expertise we have built over decades across our diverse portfolio of brands and products.

For example, by setting a clearly defined strategy for success in the United States and effectively executing that strategy, we have developed a profitable business model with revenue generated by existing players funding the cost of player acquisitions and operating expenses, leading to a US Adjusted EBITDA of $65 million and US Further Adjusted EBITDA of $167 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Group outside of the U.S. division experienced revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA growth. Revenue outside the United States grew 16%, Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.5% and Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA grew 10% year over year between December 31, 2022 and 2023, driven by the acquisition of Sisal, strong AMP growth, enhanced product and generosity initiatives. This was partly offset by lower Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA in Australia due to COVID-19 spend reversion, a softer racing market in Australia, and the annualized impact of increased point of consumption tax rate in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA growth over the same period was also driven by the “Consolidate and Invest” markets within our International division where we aim to build and maintain our leadership positions (including Italy, Spain, Georgia, Armenia, Brazil, India, and Turkey), where revenue grew 14% and Sisal online revenue grew 20% on a pro forma basis to include the Sisal acquisition as if Sisal had been acquired as of January 1, 2022. Group ExUS Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased by 1.7 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively, year over year between December 31, 2022 and 2023, primarily driven by the Australian trends noted above. We also believe that our financial profile showcases a commitment to a disciplined financial policy that is supported by a cash-generative model that we believe to be highly attractive. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated $937 million net cash provided by operating activities (2022: $1,163 million) and $938 million of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, 1.6 times our Adjusted Free Cash Flow generated in the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of strong EBITDA growth, positive working capital movements and, low capital intensity. Our U.S. business generated positive Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2023, and we believe the ongoing deleveraging impact of the growing U.S. business positions us well to achieve our medium-term leverage goals.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Our Australia and UKI divisions experienced strong recreational customer growth in the year ended December 31, 2023, with AMPs having increased a combined 9% between the two divisions compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

In the year ended December 31, 2023, our scale and product leadership enabled us to maintain our gold medal positions in our core markets, including a 2 percentage point increase in our UKI market share. For example, our UKI division launched “Live Casino” products and Sky Bet’s “AccaFreeze” during the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, the acquisition of Sisal in August 2022 has provided us with another gold medal position in Italy, one of the world’s largest regulated markets.

The acquisition of MaxBet, which holds a podium position in the attractive Serbian market, in January 2024, is the most recent example of this strategy in action.

These products are offered by FanDuel (sportsbook, iGaming and other products in our U.S. division), Sky Betting & Gaming (sportsbook and iGaming products in our UKI division), Sportsbet (sportsbook products in our Australia division), PokerStars (iGaming products in our International and U.S. divisions), Paddy Power (sportsbook and iGaming products in our UKI division), Sisal (sportsbook and iGaming products, which also includes lottery products, in our International division), tombola (iGaming products in our UKI division), Betfair (sportsbook, iGaming and other products in our UKI and International divisions), TVG (other products in our U.S. division), Junglee Games (iGaming and other products in our International division) and Adjarabet (iGaming products in our International division). In January 2024, we acquired a 51% controlling stake in MaxBet, a leading omni-channel sports betting and gaming operator in Serbia, which offers sportsbook and iGaming products and will be included in our International division from that date. We are the industry leader by size with 12.3 million Average Monthly Players (“AMPs”) and $11,790 million of revenue globally for the year ended December 31, 2023. AMPs refers to the average over the applicable reporting period of the total number of players who have placed and/or wagered a stake and/or contributed to rake (i.e., the commission we take for operating or hosting a game) or tournament fees during the month. This measure does not include individuals who have only used new player or player retention incentives, and this measure is for online players only and excludes retail player activity. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key _Operational Metrics” for additional information regarding how we calculate AMPs data, including a_ discussion regarding duplication of players that exists in such data. We operate a divisional management and operating structure across our geographic markets. Each division has an empowered management team responsible for maintaining the momentum and growth in its respective geographic markets. Our divisions are: (i) the United States (the “U.S.”), (ii) the United Kingdom and Ireland (“UKI”), (iii) Australia and (iv) International, which align with our four reportable segments. We believe that the Group is well positioned to drive future growth due to the following: - **Access to significant** **market opportunity: The U.S. market is expected to continue to experience significant growth as additional U.S. states are expected to legalize sports betting and iGaming, while outside of the U.S., the market is already worth $384 billion and also continues to grow. With just 30% of this combined market opportunity currently taking place online and $172 billion in regulated or regulating markets (excludes countries which, based on Flutter’s judgement, are not addressable by Flutter due to the regulatory regime and/or licensing structure in place), we believe that there is a long runway for future growth. - **Diversified product and geographic portfolio at scale:** We operate in a wide range of markets and offer a broad range of products. This level of diversification gives us exposure to fast-growing markets, and we also believe that it mitigates the impact on the overall Group of regulatory or other changes in individual markets. As a scale operator, we benefit from the “flywheel effect” where higher revenue growth enables greater operating leverage. This in turn enables us to invest more in our products and player proposition. - **The** **_Flutter Edge: We refer to our Group’s global competitive advantage across product, technology, people and capital provided by our scale and experience of operating online sports and betting businesses globally for over 20 years as the “Flutter Edge.” It represents the symbiotic relationship between our teams and divisions, with all contributing to and benefitting from the Flutter Edge. 123 ----- - **Optimal strategy to deliver success: We have a clearly defined Group strategy to enable us to deliver on our strategic priorities: - **Invest to win in the United States by building on our sustainable competitive advantages to extend our leadership position in new states and states where we have an existing presence. We believe that we will be able to continue to deliver leadership in the U.S. market through the FanDuel Advantage where we believe that FanDuel is (i) able to acquire players efficiently, (ii) retain players for longer and (iii) earn higher average revenue per player. - **Grow our gold medal (i.e. market-leading) positions in our other core",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.33,international markets by combining global scale with local presence to deliver,18.33.1,,"sustainable growth. This is underpinned by our sustainability strategy, our Positive Impact Plan, as striving to take care of our players, our colleagues, our communities and our planet is a goal we take very seriously. We view our size and global presence as providing a platform to make a positive, lasting impact on our industry, and we aspire to leverage our local knowledge and agility to do so in a meaningful way. The plan has four elements: - **Customers: Seeking to help customers to “Play Well” through products, tools, technology and dedicated teams designed to support positive play and tailored to local markets. Our Play Well strategy was launched in March 2021 and seeks to empower each division to have ownership over their safer gambling strategy to align with their regulatory obligations and our Play Well principles, while working groups across divisions meet regularly to share best practices and align on key topics. In addition, annual bonuses for our executive directors are determined in part by reference to achievement of certain safer gambling measures. As of December 31, 2023, 44.9% of our active online customers were using at least one Play Well tool, compared to 40.8% as of December 31, 2022. - **Colleagues: Striving to empower colleagues to “Work Better” by building teams that are representative of where we live and work. For example, we have begun taking steps in the area of diversity, equity and inclusion to increase female representation in leadership. As of December 31, 2023, 35.7% of top leadership roles below the Board level were held by women. In addition, we have begun to measure and report on pay performance, progression and retention across different employee demographics and measure employee sentiment across different employee demographics. - **Communities: Seeking to “Do More” to improve the lives of the people in our communities through our corporate social responsibility initiatives and the collective energy of our colleagues and scale of our business, including supporting charitable initiatives through company donations and colleague giving. - **Environment: As the biggest player in our sector, we believe that we have a responsibility to not only reduce our own impact but also lead on climate action, and we seek to reduce our environmental impact through our carbon reduction strategies and transition plans. Although our carbon reduction strategies and transition plans are long-term goals, we have already undertaken certain concrete steps, including establishing an internal environmental working group, enhancing our carbon accounting and assurance procedures, and developing a climate risk framework at the Group level. In addition, we have set a goal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2035 and continue to take actions as we strive toward that goal, including by assessing and transitioning our real estate 124 ----- footprint, monitoring our emissions and voluntarily submitting our net zero target to the Science Based Target Initiative for their review. While we have adopted various policies and procedures to facilitate the achievement of the goals and targets we have set pursuant to our Positive Impact Plan, they are not ultimately required to be implemented by management and there is no guarantee we will achieve them. As part of our preparation for future reporting obligations, including limited assurance of metrics, as required under the CSRD, we plan to evolve our reporting framework to enhance the overall reporting of our Positive Impact Plan metrics. - **Opportunity for long-term growth through our financial growth engine: We believe that the combination of these factors positions the Group well to capitalize on the future long-term growth of the markets we operate in, through our financial growth engine. This is built on: - **Sustainable revenue growth: We seek to expand the Group’s player base and grow player value through product innovation and efficient generosity spend. We believe that there are significant revenue growth opportunities for both our U.S. and ex-U.S. businesses. As more U.S. states have legalized sports betting and iGaming, our U.S. business has grown revenue by 134.2%, from $1,915 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to $4,484 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding the U.S. business, we have grown revenue by 14.3%, from $6,393 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to $7,306 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, including the benefit of acquisitions during that period, and we believe that our International “Consolidate and Invest” markets, which include Italy, Spain, Georgia, Armenia, Brazil, India and Turkey, provide the platform for continued high levels of future growth. - **Margin benefits: We seek to increase the efficiency of our marketing investment and operating leverage to deliver high net income margins and Adjusted EBITDA Margins. The Group’s net income (loss) margins and Adjusted EBITDA Margins have been negatively impacted in recent years by significant investments in marketing and customer acquisition in the U.S. division. As we deliver against our U.S. strategy, the net income (loss) margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin of the U.S. division have improved and we expect this trajectory to continue and drive further improvement in our consolidated net income (loss) margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin over time. - **Significant cashflow generation: Although recent acquisitions have resulted in increased long-term debt, we believe that the low levels of capital intensity due to the scalable nature of our technology platforms, and positive working capital from our expanding business, will permit us to reduce our leverage ratio over time. As of the end of the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had total long-term debt of $7,056 million and $6,750 million, respectively. - **Disciplined capital allocation: We expect to drive long-term earnings per share growth and long-term value creation through disciplined capital allocation: - **Disciplined organic investment: We believe that our player acquisition cost, lifetime value and player relationship management models and algorithms provide a disciplined evaluation framework enabling high returns from our investment in player growth and retention. - **Value creative M&A:** We have clear criteria for acquiring bolt-on, “local-hero” brands, with podium (i.e. top-three) positions in highgrowth markets. These local heroes are then complemented in the postacquisition period by the benefits of the Flutter Edge. Our acquisitions of FanDuel, Adjarabet, Junglee Games, tombola and Sisal are examples of this strategy. We believe that there remains significant 125 ----- further M&A potential to add market-leading businesses in regulated markets where the Group does not currently have a presence. - **Returns to shareholders: We expect that the Group’s projected cash generation will permit us to reduce our leverage ratio over time and provide significant future balance sheet capacity. Although we do not currently have any specific plans to pay dividends or engage in significant share repurchases, once we have optimized our leverage, we intend to return to shareholders capital that cannot be effectively deployed through organic investment or value creative M&A. We had a net loss per share of $(6.89), $(2.44) and $(5.24) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The combination of margin benefits, cashflow generation and disciplined capital allocation is expected to drive earnings per share growth and long-term value creation.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.34,Our Products,18.34.1,Sportsbook,"Our sportsbook offerings, such as FanDuel, Sportsbet or Sky Betting & Gaming, involve a customer placing a bet (wager) on various types of sporting events at fixed odds determined by us. Bets are made in advance of the sporting event that will determine the outcome of the wager. In the event the specified outcome occurs, the customer wins the bet and is paid out based upon the odds assigned at the time of the bet. We generate revenue by setting odds in a manner that includes a theoretical spread to be earned on each contest less winnings paid and expenses associated with promotional activity. In addition to this revenue, revenue from our real-money games (i.e., games in which real money is wagered on the outcome of the game) includes revenue earned on the processing of real-money deposits and cash-out options (which gives the customers the option to exit the game and to obtain an early return from their bet), in specific currencies, which is sometimes referred to as conversion margins.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Our P2B iGaming products involve customers betting against the house. Our iGaming products allow customers to bet on a range of games of chance such as online casino, bingo and machine gaming terminals. We provide a combination of third-party content and proprietary games, reflecting a shift to inhouse developed products in order to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our iGaming offerings typically include the full suite of games available in land-based casinos, such as blackjack, roulette and slot machines. We generate revenue through the gross bets placed less payouts on winning bets, which is also referred to as “hold.” Our P2P iGaming products include poker and rummy. As P2P operators, we are generally not exposed to the risks of game play or the outcome of the game, as we typically take a rake or commission from the game play. For P2P games, player liquidity, or the number or volume of players with an operator, 126 ----- is critical to the success of the game, with a greater number of players supporting a wider range and greater volume of games and larger tournaments, increasing the quality of the offering to the consumer. As a result, larger scale poker or rummy operations will benefit from superior player liquidity in their systems, which, in turn, improves their offering to customers, creating a positive feedback loop. We also offer our customers lottery products through our Sisal brand under fixed term licenses known as lottery concessions in various jurisdictions. For example, SuperEnalotto, Win for Life, VinciCasa, Eurojackpot and SiVincTutto operate in Italy, Sisal Sans operates in Turkey and Sisal Loterie Maroc operates in Morocco. Our lottery products involve customers purchasing a ticket where they have the potential to win a prize and where the winning outcome is drawn at random.

In particular, a majority of our current U.S. sports betting and DFS revenue is and will continue to be generated from bets placed on, or contests relating to, the NFL, the NBA, MLB and the NCAA, each of which has its own respective off-seasons, which may cause decreases in our future revenues during such periods. The schedule of significant sporting events that do not occur annually, such as the FIFA World Cup, the Ryder 128 ----- Cup, the UEFA European Football Championship and/or marquee boxing matches, affect the volumes of bets collected over the course of that period. Our sportsbook revenue is driven by a combination of the timing of sporting and other events and the results of our operations are derived from those events. While our iGaming revenue also benefits from activity around sporting events, it is less dependent on the sporting calendar. The overall effect of any individual sporting event is small due to the number of sporting events that take place in any given year and the diversity of our revenue source.

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.39,Marketing,18.39.1,,"Our ability to effectively acquire, engage and retain customers on our platform is critical to our operational and financial success. We believe that the combination of our brands with our data science and marketing analytics capabilities provide us with a strong competitive advantage in our industry. We utilize a variety of marketing channels, including paid external advertising through traditional and digital media, compelling new player and event-driven promotions and paid affiliate programs. We use proprietary models and software tools to track the efficacy of these marketing campaigns in real-time, giving us the ability to constantly evaluate and optimize our marketing strategies as necessary. Over time, our growth has also enabled our marketing efforts to benefit from economies of scale. We also rely on successful cross-promotion across our product offerings and consequently have developed ways to minimize friction between our offerings. For example, our FanDuel Sportsbook app features an embedded iGaming offering in states where iGaming is permissible so players can play a subset of casino games without leaving the sportsbook app. Aside from traditional marketing channels, we also enter into select media, sports and entertainment partnerships that support and accelerate our long-term strategic initiatives. Where possible, we will enter into exclusive relationships to further align interests. We have also historically partnered with athletes and celebrities that share our values in order to promote our brand. For example, in the United States, we have strategically partnered with some of the leading news, sports and entertainment companies, including Turner Sports and the Bleacher Report website. Additionally, we have ongoing commercial relationships with Sky, which allow us to use the Sky (e.g., Sky Betting and Gaming) brands and integrate with Sky’s commercial and advertising platforms pursuant to several contractual agreements. Furthermore, in the United States, we are: (i) an official sports betting partner, official sportsbook, official one-day fantasy partner, official one-day fantasy game, and official marketing partner and authorized gaming operator of the NBA; (ii) an official sponsor/partner, official sportsbook sponsor/partner, official sports betting sponsor/partner and official free to play sponsor/partner of the NFL; (iii) an official sports betting sponsor/partner of MLB; (iv) an official sports betting/wagering partner, official daily fantasy game, official daily fantasy hockey game, official daily fantasy partner, official fantasy partner and official partner of the NHL; (v) an official sportsbook, official daily fantasy partner, official marketing partner, official partner and authorized gaming operator of the WNBA; (vi) an official betting operator of the PGA TOUR; (vii) an authorized gaming operator of the WTA; (viii) an authorized gaming operator of NASCAR; and (ix) an authorized gaming operator of MLS. We also have partnerships with 19 professional teams across these and other leagues. The nature of these partnerships varies; however, each of these relationships amplifies our brand and helps us acquire and retain customers more efficiently by, for example, allowing us to open a retail sportsbook location in their arena, prominently displaying our brand on signs throughout their arena, advertising our products across their television, digital media and radio outlets and giving us access to their customer relationship databases for our marketing purposes.

FanDuel also made improvements to pricing and risk management capabilities, completing development of in-house pricing for college basketball and remodeling NFL pricing.

Other than licensed rights, we own the key intellectual property rights for the software material used in our betting and iGaming operations and the key intellectual property rights to our customer profiles and iGaming platforms, including sportsbook and poker software. While much of the intellectual property we use is owned by us, we have obtained rights to use intellectual property of third parties through licenses and service agreements with those third parties. Although we believe these licenses are sufficient for the operation of the Group, these licenses typically limit our use of the third parties’ intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws, as well as contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property rights in our sports and 130 ----- iGaming product offerings and other proprietary technology. We actively seek patent protection covering certain inventions originating from us and, from time to time, review opportunities to acquire patents to the extent we believe such patents may be useful or relevant to our business.

We were granted in 2023 a local gaming license in Germany with respect to the products upon which such claims are generally based and no longer operate with respect to those products in Germany under our Maltese remote license. However, we continue to operate under our Maltese remote license in Austria, where there is no available local regulatory framework. Generally, local courts have been ruling in favor of players in Germany and Austria, though a limited number of German courts have ruled in favor of operators. Certain claimants that have been successful in adjudicating final claims in Austria have sought enforcement of the resulting judgments in Malta. In June 2023, Malta enacted legislation which prohibits the enforcement of foreign judgments against authorized Maltese licensed operators who are acting lawfully in accordance with Maltese law, which enshrined into law long-standing Maltese public policy. As of December 31, 2023, we expect to settle claims amounting to €14 million ($16 million) and recognized a loss contingency included within Other current liabilities. In addition, there are further claims made against the Group amounting to €40 million ($45 million) as of December 31, 2023, the settlement of which is predicated on the merits of the case and whether the enforcement proceedings are successful in laying claim over the Group’s Maltese assets for settlement of these claims.

As of December 31, 2023, the Fox Option price for the Fastball Units was $4.3 billion. Such price is subject to a 5% annual compounding carrying value adjustment. Fox has until December 2030 to exercise the Fox Option. Fastball had certain rights under the FanDuel LLC Agreement and the Investor Members Agreement, which provided certain terms for the governance and operations of FanDuel Parent and rights, obligations and duties of FanDuel Parent’s members. Although it has not been determined what specific rights Fox may receive should Fox exercise (and pay for) the Fox Option and acquire the Fastball Units, the terms of the Investor Members Agreement provided that, so long as Fastball continued to own at least 5% of the outstanding FanDuel LLC Units, FanDuel could not, without the prior written consent of Fastball: (i) acquire any person, business or line of business if such acquisitions, in the aggregate, require FanDuel Parent to spend more than $75 million in cash; (ii) enter into or consummate one or a series of transactions where FanDuel Parent transfers, exclusively sublicenses or exclusively licenses or otherwise disposes of any assets, to the extent such assets have value, in the aggregate, in excess of $75 million (other than in the ordinary course of business); (iii) issue or incur debt that results in FanDuel Parent having outstanding principal debt obligations in excess of the greater of $75 million and four times FanDuel Parent’s LTM EBITDA (as defined therein); (iv) declare, make or pay any distributions or dividends on FanDuel LLC Units, other than distributions or dividends in an amount such that, following the consummation thereof, FanDuel Parent would have distributed cash dividends on FanDuel LLC Units for any twelve month period no greater than the lesser of (1) 50% of FanDuel Parent’s Free Cash Flows (as defined therein) for the prior 12 consecutive months ending on the last day of the month preceding the date of such distribution or dividend and (2) 50% of FanDuel Parent’s projected Free Cash Flows (as defined therein) for the 12 month period beginning on the last day of the month preceding the date of such distribution or dividend; (v) adopt any amendment to FanDuel Parent’s organizational documents or the FanDuel LLC Agreement; (vi) take or approve any action resulting in FanDuel Parent’s liquidation or dissolution; (vii) authorize, issue or sell FanDuel LLC Units or any other equity interest of FanDuel Parent or any other option, warrant, conversion or similar right with respect to any FanDuel LLC Units or such other equity interest in FanDuel Parent (subject to certain exceptions); (viii) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any FanDuel LLC Units, any other equity interest of FanDuel Parent or any options, warrants, conversion or similar rights with respect to any FanDuel LLC Units or such other equity interests of FanDuel Parent, except in accordance with the terms of the FanDuel LLC Agreement; (ix) enter into any transaction that would result in a Public Offering (as defined in the FanDuel LLC Agreement) or Sale Event (as defined in the FanDuel LLC Agreement), other than a Sale Event in which we and our affiliates sell 100% of our collective equity interests in FanDuel Parent to a purchaser who agrees to be bound by all our obligations under the Investor Members Agreement; (x) take any action which has the primary purpose of, or by its express terms has the effect of, benefitting us and our affiliates and harming Fastball, whether or not in its capacity as a holder of the FanDuel LLC Units; (xi) make any payment out of assets of FanDuel Parent or any of its subsidiaries in respect of any VCP Redemption Debt (as defined in the FanDuel LLC Agreement); or (xii) commit to do any of the things set forth in (i) through (xii) above. In addition, the terms of the Investor Members Agreement provided that so long as Fastball continued to hold any equity interest in FanDuel Parent, FanDuel could not, without the prior written consent of Fastball, cause or permit FanDuel Parent to own or hold any assets other than equity interests of FanDuel Group, Inc., cause or permit FanDuel Parent to own or hold less than 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of FanDuel Group, Inc., cause or permit FanDuel Group, Inc. to make any distributions to FanDuel Parent that could give rise to taxable income to Fastball in excess of its pro rata portion of the FanDuel LLC Units, or take any action or fail to take any actions with respect to tax matters that could reasonably give rise to disproportionately adverse tax consequences to Fastball as compared to us. Fox’s interpretation of its rights in relation to the Fox Option may differ from that of the Group. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—In the event that Fox exercises the Fox _Option, we would be required to sell to Fox a significant minority stake in our FanDuel business.

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.46,Regulation,18.46.1,,"We operate in a heavily regulated industry across multiple geographical jurisdictions. The area of legal and regulatory compliance continues to evolve in all of our markets, including as a result of changing political and social norms. As a result, the markets in which we operate are subject to uncertainties arising from differing approaches among jurisdictions, including the determination of where betting and iGaming activities take place and which authorities have jurisdiction over such activities. Compliance with the laws and regulations in place in each jurisdiction is a key risk area for us and is monitored and reported on by our audit committee to the Board. Our business is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with material financial interests in the iGaming operations along with the integrity and security of the sports betting and iGaming offering. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions. Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize country, state and local tax revenues, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish stringent procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and responsibility. Among other things, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to: - ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations; - establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices; - establish and maintain anti-money laundering practices and procedures; - establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures; - maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues; - maintain systems for reliable record keeping; - file periodic reports with gaming regulators; - establish programs to promote responsible gaming; and - enforce minimum age requirements. We seek to ensure that we obtain gaming licenses necessary to offer our products and services in the jurisdictions in which we operate and/or where we are otherwise required to do so. While we believe 133 ----- that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable gaming laws, licenses and regulatory requirements, we cannot be certain that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement, investigation, proceeding or other governmental action or that any such proceeding or action, as the case may be, would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations. The methods and tools we use to permit or restrict access to our online betting and iGaming product offerings within a territory are typically mandated or approved by the applicable betting and gaming regulatory authority in each jurisdiction where a Group subsidiary holds a betting and gaming license. In particular, we employ the following methods and tools across such jurisdictions: (i) IP address blocking, which identifies the location of the player and blocks his or her IP address; and (ii) country-specific blocking based on the residence of the player. In certain jurisdictions, we also employ geolocation blocking, which restricts access based upon the player’s geographical location determined through a series of data points such as mobile devices and Wi-Fi networks. We also work with regulatory and government bodies to ensure our products, including the software and technological infrastructure underlying them, undergo comprehensive testing by such regulatory and government bodies, as well as by independent, industry-leading testing, accreditation and certification organizations (including Gaming Laboratories International and BMM International). The objective of this testing is to certify, among other things, security, regulatory conformity and gaming integrity. We seek to meet or exceed best practices in operations and customer protection with an emphasis on fair and responsible gaming. Additionally, we support the regulation of iGaming, including licensing and taxation regimes and pooled poker liquidity, which we believe promotes sustainable iGaming markets that are beneficial for consumers, governments and the citizens of the regulating jurisdiction. We strive to work with applicable government authorities to develop regulations that we expect would protect consumers, encourage responsible betting and gaming, ensure reasonable levels of taxation, promote regulated gameplay and keep crime and the proceeds of crime out of gaming. We also strive to be among the first licensed operators to obtain betting and gaming licenses and provide iGaming to customers in newly regulated jurisdictions, in each case, to the extent it would be in the furtherance of our business goals and strategy and in compliance with our policies and procedures.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.47,Our Licenses,18.47.1,United States,"In the United States, gambling is regulated at both state and federal levels and divided into three categories: retail sports betting, online sports betting and iGaming. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned key gambling legislation, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (“PASPA”), which prohibited the expansion of sports betting nationwide, following New Jersey’s appeal. A number of states have since moved to legalize and regulate gambling and sports wagering at the state level. As of December 31, 2023, 35 states have legalized and regulated retail sports betting, 28 states have legalized and regulated online sports betting and six states have legalized and regulated iGaming. 134 ----- Under some states’ sports betting and iGaming laws, online sports betting and/or iGaming licenses are tethered to a finite number of specifically defined businesses that are deemed eligible for a gaming license, such as land-based casinos, tribes, professional sports franchises and arenas and horse racing tracks, each of which is entitled to a skin or multiple skins under that state’s law. A “skin” permits that license holder to partner with an online operator like FanDuel to offer online sports betting or iGaming services under that entity’s license. As such, the skin provides a market access opportunity for mobile operators to operate in the jurisdiction pending licensure and other required approvals by the state’s regulator. The entities that control those skins, and the numbers of skins available, are typically determined by a state’s sports betting or iGaming law. We currently rely on skins tethered to land-based casinos, tribes, professional sports franchises and arenas and horse racing tracks in order to access a number of markets through a skin. In other markets, we may obtain a license to offer online sports betting and/or iGaming through a direct license offered by the state, which in some cases may be subject to a competitive application process for a limited number of licenses. Our licenses in U.S. states are generally granted for a predetermined period of time (typically ranging from one to four years) or require documents to be supplied on a regular basis in order to maintain them. The market access partnership agreements that we enter into with each of our partners provide us with a skin that allows us to offer our online sports betting and iGaming products in the state or province where such partner is licensed. We make variable payments to the majority of our market access partners, typically based on a percentage of our revenue generated in the market where we use such market access partner’s skins. Our market access partners include Boyd, one of the largest and most experienced gaming companies in the United States. As stated in Boyd’s annual report for the year ended December 31, 2023, Boyd operates 28 gaming entertainment properties across 10 states. Our partnership with Boyd brings together two of the largest and most geographically diversified companies in the U.S. gaming industry and provides us with first skin access (i.e., access to the online sports betting and iGaming market of a given state or province through the use of the first skin granted by a state to a land-based gaming entity with an existing license) for online sports betting in all jurisdictions where Boyd holds gaming licenses currently, with the exception of Nevada and California. _Sportsbook and iGaming_ We operate FanDuel retail sportsbook locations in states that have authorized retail sports wagering in licensed brick-and-mortar facilities and offer our FanDuel iGaming and sportsbook products in states which have authorized iGaming or online sports wagering, respectively. In both cases, we have obtained and maintain the requisite licenses. Our FanDuel sportsbook currently operates in Arizona, Colorado (online only), Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky (online only), Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts (online only), Michigan, Mississippi (retail only), New Jersey, New York, North Carolina (online only), Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee (online only), Vermont (online only), Virginia (online only), Washington (retail only), Washington D.C. (retail only), West Virginia and Wyoming (online only). We operate FanDuel iGaming in Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan and West Virginia. Our PokerStars iGaming product currently operates in Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. We comply with each state’s requirements for offering our products, including utilizing appropriate procedures and technology to ensure that wagering on our PokerStars iGaming, FanDuel iGaming and FanDuel sportsbook products will only be accessible to persons physically present in a state in which we or one of our subsidiaries is licensed to offer online wagering. On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion determining that PASPA was unconstitutional. PASPA prohibited U.S. states from “authorizing by law” any form of sports betting. In striking down PASPA, the U.S. Supreme Court opened the potential for state-by-state authorization of sports betting. Sports betting in the United States is subject to additional laws, rules and regulations at the state level. Generally, online gambling in the United States is only lawful when specifically permitted under applicable state law. At the federal level, several laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations conducted in violation of underlying state gambling laws. These enforcement laws include the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (the “UIGEA”), the Illegal Gambling Business Act of 1970 (the “IGBA”) and the Travel Act of 1961 (the “TA”). No violation of the UIGEA, the IGBA or the TA can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law. In addition, the Wire Act provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering who knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be 135 ----- fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a state or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a state or foreign country in which such betting is legal. The U.S. Department of Justice has taken differing positions over time as to whether the Wire Act applies beyond sports betting. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in January 2021 that it does not. _Online Horse Racing Wagering_ We also own TVG, which operates two nationally distributed television networks, FanDuel TV and FanDuel Racing, the latter of which is devoted to the sport of horse racing. TVG also operates a state licensed and regulated pari-mutuel advance deposit wagering service under both the TVG and FanDuel Racing brands that facilitates pari-mutuel wagers on horse races from residents of 32 states. Advance deposit wagering is conducted pursuant to the federal Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978, as amended (the “IHA”), and applicable state laws. Through the IHA, pari-mutuel wagering operators can commingle wagers from different horse racing tracks and wagering facilities and broadcast horse racing events. TVG maintains licenses, consents, agreements and approvals where required to provide its advance deposit wagering services. Pari-mutuel wagering on horse racing is a regulated industry. In the United States, individual states control pari-mutuel wagering operations located within their respective jurisdictions with the intent of, among other things, protecting the public from unfair and illegal gambling practices, generating tax revenue, licensing operators and preventing organized crime from being involved in the industry. Although the specific form may vary, states that regulate pari-mutuel wagering generally do so through a local gambling regulatory authority, typically a racing commission. In general, these regulatory authorities require operators to submit licensing materials, including corporate and financial information, prior to granting them the necessary operating licenses. _Daily Fantasy Sports_ Our FanDuel DFS product offers paid-entry contests in 44 states and the District of Columbia (and free-to-play contests in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia) based on the laws governing fantasy sports in those individual jurisdictions. These laws fall into two categories: (i) jurisdictions that have enacted explicit laws that declare fantasy sports contests lawful games of skill (and in many cases regulate the operation of fantasy sports businesses) and (ii) jurisdictions in which the existing jurisdictional laws are interpreted in a manner to permit fantasy sports contests as lawful games of skill. At present, 23 states fall into the first category described above, and in two states (West Virginia and Rhode Island), the Attorney General’s office of each state has issued an opinion affirming the legality of paid-entry fantasy sports contests in that state. In the remaining 19 states, we operate based on a legal opinion by outside counsel interpreting the underlying law of the jurisdiction. Generally, state fantasy sports laws and regulations define paid fantasy sports, establish the rules concerning the application and licensing procedures for gaming operators in the fantasy sports business and regulate practices for paid fantasy sports deemed to be detrimental to the public interest. As part of the licensing process, we must submit, in some jurisdictions, extensive materials on our operations, including our technology and data security, age verification of customers, segregation of account funds and responsible gaming initiatives, and submit third-party audits evidencing our compliance with these requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.47,Our Licenses,18.47.2,United Kingdom and Ireland,"_United Kingdom_ Online betting and iGaming in Great Britain is regulated by the UK Gambling Act, pursuant to which the regulator, which is the UKGC, issues licenses, license conditions and codes of practice. According to the UK Gambling Act, a remote operating license is required for the provision of iGaming if at least one piece of remote gaming equipment used in the provision of gaming facilities is placed within Great Britain or if the gaming facilities provided are used or capable of being used there. In addition, the UK regulatory regime requires remote gaming operators to source their software from suppliers licensed by the UKGC. We hold online and retail betting and gaming operating licenses issued by the UKGC and the services that we offer to our customers in Great Britain are offered pursuant to these licenses. 136 ----- In December 2020, the UK government commenced a review of the UK Gambling Act, with the objective of: (i) examining whether changes are needed to the system of gambling regulation in Great Britain to reflect changes to the gambling landscape since 2005 when the UK Gambling Act was introduced, particularly in light of technological advances; (ii) ensuring there is an appropriate balance between consumer freedoms and choice, on the one hand, and prevention of harm to vulnerable groups and wider communities, on the other; and (iii) ensuring customers are suitably protected during gambling, and that there is an equitable approach to the regulation of the online and the land-based industries. The UK government’s review of the UK Gambling Act is extensive in scope. Key areas under review include: - the effectiveness of the existing online protections in preventing gambling harm and an evidence-based consideration of, for example, imposing greater control on online product design, such as stake, speed and prize limits, and the introduction of deposits, loss and spend limits; - the benefits or harms caused by allowing licensed gambling operators to advertise and make promotional offers and the positive or negative impact of gambling sponsorship arrangements across sports, e-sports and other areas; - the effectiveness of the regulatory system currently in place, including consideration of whether the UKGC has sufficient investigative, enforcement and sanctioning powers both to regulate the licensed market and address the unlicensed market; - the availability and suitability of redress arrangements in place for an individual consumer who considers it may have been treated unfairly by a gambling operator, including consideration of the introduction of other routes for consumer redress, such as a gambling ombudsman; and - the effectiveness of current measures to prevent illegal underage gambling and consideration of what extra protections may be needed for young adults in the 18-25 age bracket. The call for evidence in connection with the review concluded in March 2021. On April 27, 2023, the UK government issued a white paper, which included proposals to: - hold a consultation to determine the maximum staking limit for online slot gaming products of between £2 and £15 per spin, with options of a £2 limit per stake, £4 limit per stake or an approach based on individual risk for 18-24 year-old players; - hold a consultation to determine whether to make player-set deposit limits mandatory or optout rather than opt-in; - introduce a statutory levy (as a percentage of revenue) requiring all licensed operators to make contributions to help fund research, education and treatment of gambling harms; and - hold a consultation on imposing new obligations on licensed operators to conduct: - enhanced spending checks if a player loses £1,000 within one day or £2,000 within 90 days, with such thresholds halved for 18-24 year-old players; and - financial vulnerability checks if a player loses more than £125 within one month or £500 within one year. Although we seek to meet or exceed best practices in operations and customer protection with an emphasis on fair and responsible gaming, changes to regulation arising from the UK government’s review of the UK Gambling Act could impede our ability to generate revenue in Great Britain and attract new and existing customers in Great Britain, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding the UK Gambling Act review and its potential impact on our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation, Licensing, Litigation and Taxation—The UK 137 ----- _government’s ongoing review of the UK Gambling Act may result in more onerous regulation of the betting and gaming industry in Great Britain, part of our second-largest market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation, Licensing, Litigation and Taxation—Adverse changes to the regulation of online betting and iGaming, or their interpretation by regulators, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” Republic of Ireland_ The Irish general regulatory framework is partially regulated by way of the Betting Act, 1931 (the “Irish Betting Act”). The Irish Betting Act was amended in 2015 to include regulation for online bookmaking, which is regulated by the Irish Revenue Commissioners Office. Licenses for online bookmakers are required for operators servicing the Irish market by providing sports betting services. The nominated officers of license applicants must undergo personal licensure and hold a tax clearance certificate in addition to a certificate of personal fitness. With respect to online casino games, these are provided based on an online betting and gaming license which is widely referred to as a “dot.com” or “point of supply” license. These “dot.com” licenses differ in nature to “country” or “point of consumption” licenses, which are territory specific. “Dot.com” licenses enable the supply of online betting and iGaming to other jurisdictions, in accordance with those licenses’ regulations and under the governance of the relevant regulator and regulatory regime, based on the principle of internet legislation that deems the provision of an online product as provided where the operator is established and located. Ireland does not currently have a regime for “Dot.com” licenses for online casino, online lotteries or other iGaming undertaken on a commercial basis. In December 2022, the Irish government published the first draft of the Gambling Regulation Bill, which proposes major reform and consolidation of gambling laws in Ireland, including the creation of a Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland, which will have broad powers to publish further guidance and codes of conduct. The Gambling Regulation Bill seeks to (1) modernize the licensing system; (2) introduce robust enforcement measures, including suspension and revocation of licenses, financial penalties (up to the greater of 10% of the licensee’s annual turnover or €20,000,000) and imprisonment; and (3) protect vulnerable persons, including children and those experiencing gambling addiction, through prohibiting licensees from accepting credit cards for the purposes of gambling and the creation of National Gambling Exclusion Register and Social Impact Fund.

Similar to our commercial strategy, each division has ownership of their safer gambling strategy (including policy and process) that aligns with their regulatory obligations and our Play Well principles. We have a safer gambling board (a subcommittee of our Risk and Sustainability Committee) who meet regularly and a global Play Well working group who also meet regularly to share best practice and align on key strategic topics.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Holders of sportsbook maker licenses",18.48.1,International,"_Italy_ In Italy, the state reserves authority over public gaming (Art. 1 of Legislative Decree no. 496 of 14 April 1948). Accordingly, operators seeking to carry out gaming activities in Italy must first obtain a 138 ----- concession from the Italian government. We are active in the Italian online betting and iGaming market through our brands Betfair, PokerStars, tombola and Sisal, which, in each case, all hold concessions issued by the Italian Customs and Monopolies Agency. _Spain_ The Spanish Gambling Act, which came into effect on May 29, 2011, regulates the Spanish online gambling market and requires that operators that provide gambling services (e.g., betting and iGaming) in Spain obtain an operating license from the Directorate General for the Regulation of Gambling (Dirección _General de Ordenación del Juego) (“DGOJ”). In Spain, our PokerStars, Betfair, tombola and Sisal brands_ are licensed by the DGOJ, enabling us to offer a number of betting and iGaming products locally. _Germany_ The German Interstate Treaty on Gambling permits operators to obtain licenses from the German gambling regulator, (Gemeinsame Glücksspielbehörde der Länder) (“GGL”). PokerStars is licensed by the GGL to operate online poker and slots products in Germany. _India_ In early 2023, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (the “Ministry”) issued amendments to the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the “Rules”) to regulate iGaming. The Rules provide that an iGaming operator shall observe these Rules while discharging its duties. iGaming operators are required by the Rules to set up “self-regulatory bodies” that are to be approved by the Ministry. In India, our Junglee Games brand operates games such as Howzatt, Junglee Rummy and Junglee Poker, which come within the ambit of the Rules. _Georgia_ The Law of Georgia “On Organizing Lotteries, Games of Chance and Prize Games,” which came into effect on April 19, 2005, regulates the Georgian gambling market and requires that operators organizing online gambling in Georgia obtain permits from the Revenue Service of Georgia (the “LEPL”). In Georgia, our Adjarabet brand is licensed by the LEPL, enabling us to offer betting and iGaming products in Georgia. _Armenia_ The laws of the Republic of Armenia “On Gambling, Online Gambling and Casinos” and “On Lotteries,” which came into effect on January 24, 2004, regulate the Armenian gambling and betting market. These laws require that operators organizing online gambling in Armenia obtain operating licenses from the Ministry of Finance of Armenia (the “MoF”).

Holders of sportsbook maker licenses",18.48.2,Multi-jurisdictional Licenses,"Through certain of our subsidiaries, we hold gambling licenses in Malta and Alderney, which are often referred to as “multi-jurisdictional” or “point-of-supply” licenses (as opposed to the local, territoryspecific or “point-of-consumption” licenses). These multi-jurisdictional licenses are used by our various subsidiaries to supply our online gambling products to persons located in jurisdictions where we do not possess a local, territory-specific or point-of-consumption gambling licenses. Where online gambling products hosted on Maltese and/or Alderney servers are made available by us for online usage by our customers in other jurisdictions (pursuant to the relevant multi-jurisdictional licenses), it is done based on the principle of e-commerce and internet law that deems the provision of online products to take place where the operator’s server and/or the operator itself is established and located. This principle is widely relied upon by online gambling operators as well as by many other e-commerce businesses. Accordingly, we rely on the fact that our supply of online gambling product offerings is lawfully licensed or approved within the jurisdiction of origin (i.e., Malta or Alderney in this case) as the rationale for our lawful offer of gambling product offerings to other jurisdictions where either: (i) such other jurisdictions have not established a regulatory and licensing framework for online gambling; (ii) the 139 ----- availability to citizens of online gambling hosted outside their jurisdictional boundaries is not clearly prohibited by the law of the jurisdiction; or (iii) the local laws of such other jurisdiction lack extra-territorial effect, including where local law is contrary to any supra-national law from which we benefit. Where, however, any jurisdiction has enacted local domestic laws that clearly prohibit the availability to citizens of online betting and gambling products hosted abroad, and where it is clear that such local domestic law has extra-territorial application to us, to the extent that the principle of extraterritoriality described above is clearly overridden, we will take technical and administrative measures aimed at preventing persons from the relevant jurisdictions accessing our gambling product offerings. Set forth below is an overview of certain (but not all) jurisdictions for which we rely on our multijurisdictional licenses. _Alderney_ The Bailiwick of Guernsey includes Alderney, which has been recognized as a leading offshore licensing jurisdiction for remote gambling since 2000. Alderney has its own government and legislature, and online gambling in Alderney is regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (“AGCC”). Under the Gambling (Alderney) Law 1999, all forms of gambling are unlawful unless conducted in accordance with the terms of an ordinance. Alderney issued an ordinance in 2001 providing that only online gambling (known as eGambling) conducted under a license is lawful. The state has subsequently refined the regulation of eGambling by adopting various amendments to this ordinance and by issuing the Alderney eGambling Regulations, 2009. The current ordinance regulating online gambling in Alderney is the Alderney eGambling (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021. Various licenses are available in Alderney and are determined by the nature of the services being supplied and the location and set-up of the license-holders’ infrastructure. Remote operators, business-to-business core service providers and key individuals all require a license issued by the AGCC to offer their services from Alderney. Sky Bet holds Category 1 and Category 2 eGambling licenses, which permit us to host remote gambling equipment in Guernsey and to offer sports betting, virtual sports, bingo, casino games and poker to our online customers based in Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, as well as the Republic of Ireland in respect of bingo, casino games and poker only. _Malta_ Online betting and iGaming is regulated in Malta under the Maltese Gaming Act 2018. Malta does not permit a person to provide or carry out a betting and gaming service or provide a critical betting or gaming supply from Malta or to any person in Malta, or through a Maltese legal entity, except when in possession of a valid license by the Maltese Gambling Authority (“MGA”), which is the primary regulatory body responsible for the governance of all betting and gaming activities in Malta. The Maltese regulatory framework provides for two types of licensing, a business-to-business license and a business-to-consumer license. MGA approval is required for each game type to be offered under the license. The term of these licenses is ten years in each case. In addition to a renewable business-to-business license, we also hold four renewable business-toconsumer licenses covering sports betting, peer to peer betting exchanges, games of skill (including poker), casino and games. Under the Maltese Gaming Act, we are required to make monthly compliance contributions that are payable in Malta and are calculated based on our revenue from online betting and iGaming offered through our Maltese gaming licenses. With respect to online betting and iGaming offered under our Maltese gaming licenses to customers in certain other jurisdictions, we also pay applicable gaming duty or VAT in those jurisdictions on some or all of the online betting and iGaming offerings in those jurisdictions. As Malta is part of the European Union, it is subject to EU law, including the EU principle on the free movement of services. Accordingly, Maltese gaming licenses entitle licensees to provide iGaming services from Malta or to any person in Malta, or through a Maltese legal entity in compliance with an EU member states’ local regulatory regime. 140 ----- _Other Licenses_ PokerStars currently operates on a locally-regulated basis in each of Bulgaria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Michigan, New Jersey, Ontario, Pennsylvania, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Betfair currently operates on a locally-regulated basis in each of Denmark, Italy, Malta, Romania, Spain, and Sweden. PokerStars and Betfair also hold technical licenses to supply services in relation to gaming services on a business-to-business basis in each of Romania, Malta and Sweden. Additionally, PokerStars holds technical licenses in Greece and the Isle of Man. Outside of Italy, Sisal also holds lottery concessions in Morocco, Turkey and Tunisia. In every instance where we hold a local license, we utilize appropriate procedures and technology to maintain compliance with the territory’s requirements for offering our products. We also engage on an ongoing basis with local gaming regulators to provide standard regulatory reporting and to respond to ongoing ad hoc queries, as well as to complete prescribed regulatory audit or assurance reviews to evidence compliance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Privacy and information protection laws require, among other things, that entities collecting and processing such personal information do so in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory conditions. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) cites as its core principles: (i) lawful, fair and transparent processing; (ii) processing for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes; (iii) that personal information be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes in hand; (iv) that personal information be accurate and kept updated; (v) that personal data be retained for only as long as necessary; and (vi) appropriate security against loss, destruction, damage or theft is implemented. Failure to comply with applicable privacy and personal information laws can result in regulatory sanctions, fines and, in certain cases, criminal liability. Regarding our operations in Europe, particularly where the personal information being processed relates to residents of EU member states, the European Union enacted the GDPR on May 25, 2018, to replace European Union Directive 95/46/EC as well as the national implementing legislation in each EU member state. For example, the United Kingdom has adopted the GDPR along with supplementary legislation in the form of the Data Protection Act 2018. The GDPR imposes more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and significant penalties for non-compliance. For instance, the GDPR introduces two categories of administrative fines depending on the seriousness of the breach that will range from: (a) up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenues of the preceding year (whichever is higher) for serious infringements; or (b) up to €10 million or 2% of worldwide revenues of the preceding financial year for less serious infringements. With respect to the GDPR, we maintain records of our data processing activities and carry out our own risk-based due diligence on entities that act as data processors on our behalf, and we have introduced electronic systems and processes that facilitate the deletion of our customers’ personal information that is no longer in use. Additionally, to help ensure that personal information belonging to our customers and employees will be processed in accordance with the GDPR (as well as any other relevant privacy and data and information protection legislation), we have posted revised privacy statements together with updated terms and conditions for use of our product offerings on our websites. Further, the UK GDPR came into effect on January 1, 2021, and, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law following Brexit. The UK GDPR mirrors 141 ----- the fines under the GDPR (up to £17.5 million or 4% of the annual global revenues, whichever is greater). The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium-to-longer term and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Compliance with the GDPR and the UK GDPR may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance-related costs and expenses and these changes may lead to other additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. Many jurisdictions outside of the European Union are enacting more robust data protection laws, in many cases following similar principles to those set out in the GDPR. For example, in the United States, our largest and fastest growing market, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several U.S. territories have some form of data breach notification laws while individual states have introduced broader consumer privacy legislation. For example, in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was further expanded by the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, or CPRA, which took effect in most material respects on January 1, 2023 (with application to data collected beginning on January 1, 2022) (the “CCPA”) established a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours. The CCPA also provides for regulatory penalties for violations, as well as a private cause of action for data breaches, and the CPRA imposed even stricter obligations on companies and established a state regulatory agency to enforce those requirements. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. As of February 2024, at least twelve additional U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy legislation. Most of these statutes impose less stringent obligations than the CCPA but generally align to the same principles. These laws may require substantial modifications to covered companies’ data processing practices and policies, impose compliance-related costs and expenses to provide updated notices to employees and customers, and we may be required to negotiate or renegotiate contractual obligations with third-party service providers. Such laws will restrict processing activities, likely limiting our ability to market to customers and/or increasing operational and compliance costs. The introduction of new or further data protection laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which we currently operate, including in Canada, modifies our data processing activities and/or increases our operational and compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. In addition to the variety of existing laws and regulations governing our use of personal data, there are a wide variety of other laws that are currently being enacted or under development and which may have a material impact on whether, and how, we can operate our online services in certain jurisdictions. For example, the Digital Services Act came into full effect in the European Union on February 17, 2024, resulting in changes to the regulation of online content that is deemed to be illegal or harmful. Fines under the Digital Services Act can amount to up to 6% of an organization’s global annual turnover. Similarly, the AI Act will likely have implications for how AI technology is used in our business and across the industry generally. Similar to the Digital Services Act, the top tier of fines that may be imposed under the AI Act can be up to 30 million euro or 6% of global annual turnover. Any significant changes to applicable laws, regulations, interpretations of laws or regulations, or market practices, regarding privacy, digital services and data protection, or regarding the manner in which we seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could require us to make modifications to our products, services, policies, procedures, notices, and business practices, including potentially material changes. Such changes could potentially have an adverse impact on our business. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Information Technology Systems and Intellectual Property—The increasing application of and any significant failure to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and digital services laws may have a material adverse effect on us.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Our compliance and risk program focuses on, among other things, meeting regulatory requirements, reducing and managing problematic gaming activities and providing tools to assist customers in making educated choices related to gaming activities. 142 ----- We have a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, collusion and other forms of cheating and we work with regulators and law enforcement globally on such matters. We believe that we have a robust and extensive set of policies and procedures designed to identify and/or prevent such issues, including, without limitation our (i) anti-money laundering & countering the financing of terrorism policy; (ii) gifts and hospitality policy; (iii) cyber security policy; (iv) third party financial crime policy standard; (v) sanctions policy; (vi) anti-bribery and corruption policy; (vii) code of ethics; (viii) whistle-blower policy; and (ix) procurement & supplier risk & performance management policy. Among other measures, we conduct risk-based customer due diligence, escalate certain matters for further investigation, and routinely monitor customer activity, including identifying the use of potential “proceeds of crime” in gaming. Customer activities that can trigger customer interactions initiated by us include abnormal deposit and cash out patterns, customer-to-customer transfers and game play and prolonged, repetitive and unprofitable gaming. These are all monitored in accordance with local regulations and the guidelines of relevant gaming authorities. We also have a dedicated compliance team that works with our employees and various departments to implement routine business activity monitoring and seeks to ensure that we comply with our regulatory obligations under our betting and gaming licenses, as well as with all other laws and regulations applicable to our business in each jurisdiction where we operate. Additionally, we employ various methods and tools across our operations such as: (i) geolocation blocking, which restricts access based upon the customer’s geographical location determined through a series of data points such as mobile devices and Wi-Fi networks; (ii) age verification to ensure our customers are old enough to participate; (iii) routine monitoring of customer activity; and (iv) risk-based customer due diligence to ensure the funds used by our customers are legitimately derived. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws and have developed appropriate policies and procedures in order to comply with the requirements of the evolving regulatory regimes, we cannot assure that our compliance program will prevent or detect the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us, a customer or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) hereby agrees (and is irrevocably authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Party) that it shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any security document) as is requested by the Parent in order to complete, implement or facilitate a Permitted Transaction. In the event that the Parent makes any request pursuant to and in reliance on the preceding sentence, the Security Agent shall be permitted to request a confirmation from the Parent that the relevant transaction, matter or other step is a Permitted Transaction and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents. If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of the Senior Liabilities then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Finance Documents and such application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document. The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at the cost of the Parent): (a) release the security; and 194 ----- (b) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities, undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents, on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent). _Distressed Disposals_ Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of, or shares issued by, an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or (c) being disposed of to a third-party subsequent to a distress event. If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor): (a) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable; (b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release: (i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities; (ii) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and (iii) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, (c) on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor representatives; (d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to release: (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities; (ii) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets; and (iii) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company, (e) on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor representatives; (f) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company: (i) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the 195 ----- purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of: all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors; (g) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to: (i) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intragroup liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and (ii) if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred. The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of constituted charged property), as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred. In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price). If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company from any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating to a Letter of Credit, an Operating Facility or an Ancillary Facility made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor or Operating Facility Lender), following that release. If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Senior Parent Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company from any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Secured Creditors unless those Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating to a Letter of Credit, an Operating Facility or an Ancillary Facility made the subject of cash collateral 196 ----- arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor, Second Lien Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender), following that release. Where Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities transferred to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities. Subject to the immediately following two paragraphs, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction). If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities will be released or disposed of, or any security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either: (a) each Second Lien Agent has approved the release; or (b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor are sold: (i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and (ii) all claims of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any) all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates) and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that if each of the Senior Facility Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor Representative (acting reasonably and in good faith): (A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not released and discharged; and (B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and (c) such sale or disposal is made: (i) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate; or (ii) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant 197 ----- circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction). If prior to the first date on which the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent Financing Debt has occurred, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any security over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be released and/or the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either: (a) each Senior Parent Agent has approved the release; or (b) where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of the Senior Parent Debt Issuer are sold: (i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); (ii) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security interests under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good faith): (A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged; and (B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and (iii) such sale or disposal is made: (A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate; or (B) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The Guarantors providing the Notes Guarantees also guarantee the New Credit Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantee to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such limitations, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Financial Profile, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.” In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes_ ----- _Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each_ Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Issuer) that also guarantees each of the New Credit Facilities or certain other indebtedness, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The term “Notes Guarantees” shall also be deemed to refer to any such future additional Notes Guarantee that may be granted from time to time in accordance with the Indenture, and the term “Guarantors” shall also be deemed to refer to any Guarantor that grants such future additional Notes Guarantee. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in connection with the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), which will include obligations under the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization laws, capital maintenance rules, general statutory limitations, retention of title claims or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction or any similar principles which may limit the ability of any non-U.S. entity to provide a guarantee or security or which may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or scope or otherwise. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Financial Profile, the Notes, the Notes _Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be limited by applicable law.”_ The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released: - except in the case of the Notes Guarantee by the Company, upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of ownership interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Subsidiary of the Company, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company), in each case, otherwise permitted by the Indenture; - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued under the Indenture or defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “— _Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_ - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;” - with respect to any Guarantor, upon the release of any guarantees granted by such Guarantor in favor of the obligations under the Credit Agreement; or - notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including (x) upon a Non-Distressed Disposal (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and (y) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Notes Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer or Guarantor, will execute any documents delivered to it by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Notes Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination. Upon receipt of the aforementioned Officer’s Certificate on which the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on without further inquiry, the Trustee shall effectuate such release of a Notes Guarantee without seeking further instruction from the Holders of the Notes. Substantially all of the business operations of the Company is conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of any ----- preferred shareholders and minority shareholders of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders.

The Agreed Security Principles under the Credit Agreement require (i) security to be granted over the shares of each Guarantor (as defined in the Credit Agreement) held by another Guarantor pursuant to the Credit Agreement and (ii) security over all material assets (excluding certain other excluded property) to be granted over each of the Loan Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement) incorporated or organized in the United States of America. These Agreed Security Principles will apply to the security granted for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not perfected) in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including: - if providing such security would result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization laws, capital maintenance rules, general statutory limitations, retention of title claims or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction or any similar principles which may limit the ability of an obligor ----- to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or scope or otherwise; - if providing such security would result in any (x) material risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of security or guarantor of contravention of their fiduciary duties or any legal prohibition, or (y) risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of security or guarantor of civil or criminal or personal liability; - if providing such security would result in costs (as determined in good faith) that are excessive in relation to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of the security or the guarantee, which determination may be made by reference to the costs of creating or perfecting the security or guarantee, on the one hand, versus the value of the assets being secured or guarantee granted, on the other hand, or the value of the assets being secured or guarantees granted, on the one hand, versus the value of all assets already secured and guarantees granted as a whole, on the other hand, or otherwise; - if providing such security would impose an undue administration burden on, or material inconvenience to the ordinary course of operations of, the provider of the security or guarantee (as determined in good faith) if it is reasonably determined that such burden or material inconvenience is excessive in relation to the benefit obtained by the beneficiary of the security or guarantee; - create security over any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by the Credit Agreement (or not expressly prohibited by the Credit Agreement) to the extent (and for so long as) such arrangements prevent those assets from being charged or would result in a default, penalty, termination or loss of benefit of the provider of such security as a result; - if providing such security would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant obligor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise not prohibited; - if providing such security, the maximum granted or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the granted or secured amount is reasonably determined to be excessive in relation to the level of such fees, taxes and duties; or - if providing such security where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the costs of granting security over the immaterial assets is reasonably determined to be excessive in relation to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only. Furthermore, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, no security or guarantees will be required in jurisdictions other than those where the Issuer or any of the Guarantors have assets, which, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, include Alderney, Australia, Delaware, England and Wales, Gibraltar, Ireland, Isle of Man, Malta or the Netherlands. The security over the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the Issuer. ----- The Collateral also secures, or will secure, as applicable, the relevant security provider’s liabilities under the New Credit Facilities, liabilities under certain hedging arrangements and other indebtedness (including any Additional Notes). Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens,” the Company is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with_ future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

For a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The ability of the Security Agent to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Issuer’s, a Guarantor’s or the relevant Collateral grantor’s or provider’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Financial Profile, the Notes, the Notes _Guarantees and the Collateral—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company, the Issuer or the Guarantors in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all, or at any particular price. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of certain of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Trustee for the Notes will have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: ----- - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the other Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights and powers that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the other Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights and powers; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance ----- with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which such Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, such Payor will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that such Payor has or would become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee shall accept, and will be entitled to conclusively rely on, such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to the Issuer and to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is incorporated or organized, resident or engaged in business for tax purposes or has a permanent establishment in, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any of their agents, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein; or (2) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, resident or engaged in business for tax purposes or has a permanent establishment in, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required in respect of any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor with respect to any Note or Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the relevant Payor will pay to Holders of the Notes (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding in respect of such Additional Amounts) by any applicable withholding agent, will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of: (3) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, or having a place of management present or deemed present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee; (4) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or ----- beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes, but only to the extent that the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such certification or other evidence; (5) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the Notes or any Notes Guarantee; (6) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax; (7) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent; (8) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to (a) Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with) and any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, (b) any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of (a), or (c) any law, regulation or other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction relating to an intergovernmental agreement described in (b); or (9) any combination of the above. Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficial owner of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period). In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership (or entity treated as partnership for tax purposes) or other than the beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership (or such other entity treated as partnership for tax purposes) or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Issuer and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent if the Notes are then admitted for listing on the Exchange. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Trustee be required to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any Holder. If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. ----- Wherever in either the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes or any other excise, property or similar Taxes, that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery or registration of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto, and any such Taxes that arise in any jurisdiction from the enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto, and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders or beneficial owners for any such Taxes paid by such Holders or beneficial owners. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is incorporated or organized, resident or engaged in business for tax purposes or has a permanent establishment in, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.20,Repurchase at the Option of Holders,21.20.1,Change of Control,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of _Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate_ principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior to the purchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send or cause to be sent notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the Register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of _Control,” and that all Notes validly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be_ accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below; (3) that any Note not validly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address ----- specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control and the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control, the notice shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control covenant, that a Holder must follow. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar or Paying Agent, with a copy to the Trustee, for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Registrar or Paying Agent stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Credit Agreement provides, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Company or the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Company would give creditors a right to repayment or could constitute a default thereunder. If we experience a change of control that triggers a default under the Credit Agreement or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the New Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the New Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the New Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. ----- The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The definition of “Change of Control” or the provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified, in each case prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer, and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by Holders of the Notes, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes, provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the “Second Change of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. Notwithstanding any other term of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document, no Permitted Reorganization shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or any Security Document, or a Default or an Event of Default. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been ----- discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default or Event of Default is received by a responsible officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain CovenantsReports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured, and any declaration of acceleration of the Notes resulting therefrom shall be automatically annulled, upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security and/or cost and fee cover (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, fees or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, fees or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover (including by way of pre-funding); and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The ----- Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 150 days after the end of the first fiscal year of the Company ending after the Issue Date, and within 120 days after the end of each of the fiscal years of the Company thereafter, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover (including by way of pre-funding) to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.” Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act). Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued, in the case of the EUR Notes, and provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than $200,000 will be issued, in the case of the USD Notes.

The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced.

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.46,"Information concerning Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC",21.46.1,,"All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and/or DTC, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the Agents nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. We understand as follows with respect to DTC: DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear, Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC participants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

(a) Subject to the discussion below, the Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on the Notes so long as the following conditions are met: the Notes are quoted Eurobonds, i.e. securities which are issued by a company (such as the Issuer), which are listed on a recognized stock exchange (which is interpreted by the Irish Revenue Commissioners to mean an exchange which is recognized by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the country in which it is located and has substantially the same level of recognition in that country as the Irish Stock Exchange has in Ireland, such as the Exchange) and which carry a right to interest; and (b) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland, or if such person is in Ireland, either: - the Notes are held in a clearing system recognized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners; (DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are, amongst others, so recognized); or - the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to a relevant person (such as a paying agent located in Ireland) in the prescribed form. Thus, subject to the discussion below, so long as the Notes continue to be quoted on a recognized stock exchange (such as the Exchange) and are held in a clearing system recognized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, interest on the Notes can be paid by any paying agent acting on behalf of the Issuer free of any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax. If the Notes continue to be quoted but cease to be held in a recognized clearing system, interest on the Notes may be paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax provided such payment is made through a paying agent outside Ireland. No Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of a repayment of any principal amount of the Notes. Interest or other distributions paid out on the Notes which are profit-dependent or any part of which exceeds a reasonable commercial return could, under certain anti-avoidance provisions, be recharacterized as a non-deductible distribution and so be subject to dividend withholding tax in certain circumstances.

Particular rules not discussed below may apply to certain classes of taxpayers holding Notes, such as dealers in securities, trusts etc. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only and do not discuss all aspects of taxation in Ireland that may be relevant to any particular holder of the Notes.

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.52,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.52.1,Effect of Certain Contingencies,"In certain circumstances (see, for example, “Description of the Notes— Repurchases at the Option _of Holders—,” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) we may be obligated to pay amounts_ in excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes or to repay principal in advance of the stated maturity of the Notes. It is possible that these contingencies could implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies are remote or incidental (or that certain other exceptions apply), and thus, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder discloses such U.S. Holder’s contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination, however, is not binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, a U.S. Holder might be required to include in gross income an amount of interest at a rate greater than the stated interest rate and prior to the receipt of cash, and might be required to treat any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. In the event a contingency occurs, it may affect the amount and timing of income recognized by a U.S. Holder. The remainder of this summary assumes that our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is correct. The Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments have not been the subject of authoritative interpretation, however, and the scope of the regulations is not certain. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.52,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.52.2,Stated Interest,"Stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued, depending on such holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes constitutes income from sources outside the United States for foreign tax credit purposes. In the case of EUR Notes, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “cash basis U.S. Holder”) and that receives a payment of stated interest on a Note will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment of stated interest on a EUR Note, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of euros. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) (an “accrual basis U.S. Holder”) may ----- determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a stated interest payment denominated in euros in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of the U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year). Under the second method, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of the U.S. Holder, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of stated interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an accrual basis U.S. Holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may instead translate the accrued stated interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt of such interest. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Upon receipt of the stated interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or retirement of a EUR Note) denominated in euros, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of payments of stated interest on the Notes. It is expected, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be its cost. The amount realized does not include any amounts that are attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income (as described above) to the extent not previously included in income. Except to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates with respect to EUR Notes (as described below), any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source for foreign tax credit purposes. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or retirement of Notes. The cost of a EUR Note purchased with euros generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price paid on the date of purchase. The amount realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of a EUR Note for an amount in euros will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros on the date of sale or other taxable disposition of a EUR Note, or the settlement date for the sale, in the case of EUR Notes traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations, that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects). The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of EUR Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. In any case where the amount realized is determined by reference to the exchange rate on the disposition date (as opposed to the settlement date), the U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) to the extent there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date. A U.S. Holder generally will recognize U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the sale or other taxable disposition of a EUR Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the EUR Note (i) at the spot rate on the date of sale or other taxable disposition (or possibly on the settlement date) and (ii) at the spot rate on ----- the date of purchase. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid stated interest) will be recognized only to the extent of total gain or loss recognized on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

This summary deals only with U.S. Holders that purchase Notes at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of such notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and that will hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors (including consequences under the alternative minimum tax or the net investment income tax), and does not address federal nonincome, state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or the trust has a valid election in place to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. ----- The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

The Australian withholding taxation implications of any such payments by the Australian Guarantor will depend on whether the amounts paid by the Australian Guarantor under the Notes Guarantees constitute payments of interest (as defined in Section 128A(1AB) of the Australian Income Tax _Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the “Tax Act”)). There are good arguments that such payments (other than_ interest paid on an overdue amount) do not constitute “interest” for Australian withholding tax purposes, and, if so, would not be subject to Australian interest withholding tax. The Australian Taxation Office has, however, published a Taxation Determination stating that payments by a guarantor in respect of debentures (such as the Notes) are entitled to the benefit of the ----- exemption contained in section 128F of the Tax Act if payments of interest in respect of those debentures by the Issuer are exempt from Australian interest withholding tax under section 128F. However, there is some doubt as to whether the Taxation Determination applies in the context of the Notes Guarantees and whether the reasoning adopted in the Taxation Determination is strictly correct. If Australian interest withholding tax is ultimately determined to be due on any payment made by the Australian Guarantor, Australian interest withholding tax at a rate of 10% will be payable on the payment of interest by the Australian Guarantor. In these circumstances, a Non-Resident Investor may be entitled to Additional Amounts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and will not be qualified under nor will they incorporate provisions by reference, or be subject, to the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (as amended). Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. When considering an investment in the Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code, and may result in the disqualification of an IRA. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a Guarantor, an Initial Purchaser or certain of their respective affiliates is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. Included among these statutory exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code, which exempt certain transactions (including, without limitation, a sale and purchase of securities) between a Covered Plan and a party in interest so long as (i) such party in interest is treated as such solely by reason of providing services to the Covered Plan, (ii) such party in interest is not a fiduciary which renders investment advice, or has or exercises discretionary authority or control, with respect to the assets of the Covered Plan involved in such transaction, or an affiliate of any such person and (iii) the Covered Plan neither receives less than nor pays more than “adequate consideration” (as defined in such Sections) in connection with such transaction. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully ----- review the exemption in consultation with its legal advisers to assure the exemption is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Plans that are government plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing and/or holding of the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their legal advisers regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law and whether an exemption would be required.

Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, stabilizing managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, stabilizing managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Stabilizing managers may also over-allot the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, stabilizing managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. Stabilizing managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Financial Profile, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the _Collateral—_ _There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of any of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the Issuer and the Guarantors and its and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing Term Loan B Facility and/or under the Revolving Credit Facility, and thus may receive a portion of the proceeds from the Offering. Certain Initial Purchasers provide financial and merger and acquisition advisory services to the Issuer and the Guarantors. Certain of the Initial Purchasers further act as agents under the Credit Facilities, including as administrative agent or collateral agent. Each of the Initial Purchasers comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in activities and businesses, including among others, securities, commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, research publication, and principal investing, as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment ----- management and other commercial services and products to a wide range of corporations, governments and individuals from which conflicting interests or duties, or a perception thereof, may arise. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Company or the Guarantors or their respective affiliates (including the Notes). If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer, the Company and the Guarantors or its affiliates, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those Initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge, and certain of those Initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and the Guarantors consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchaser and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The New EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the New EU Insolvency Regulation that, as regards Ireland, includes, among others, the insolvency proceedings, court-approved refinancing agreements, out-of-court payment proceedings and anticipated arrangement proposals. The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. In accordance with Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, the COMI of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if such company’s registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. However, it is possible to rebut this presumption “where the company’s central administration is _located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State” (preamble 30 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation)._ Prior to June 26, 2017, when the New EU Insolvency Regulation came into effect, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a company’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where such company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and it may change from time to time, but it is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the 3-month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition. ----- The New EU Insolvency Regulation distinguishes between: - main insolvency proceedings, which have universal scope and are aimed at encompassing all the debtor’s assets, and - secondary insolvency proceedings, which run in parallel with the main insolvency proceedings and are limited to the assets located in a different Member State to that in which the debtor has its COMI. Main insolvency proceedings in respect of a debtor may be commenced in the jurisdiction of the Member State (other than Denmark) where such debtor has its COMI and, therefore, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence any of the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, including those mentioned above. Those main insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the New EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark). Secondary (or ‘territorial’) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State against the same debtor, but only if such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation to mean a place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Depending on whether the main insolvency proceedings commence prior to or after the commencement of secondary insolvency proceedings, the following scenarios should be noted: - where main insolvency proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which a debtor has its COMI, any insolvency proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State shall be secondary insolvency proceedings; and - where main insolvency proceedings in the Member State in which a debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be opened in such other Member State where such debtor has an establishment in the event that either (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down by the law of the Member State within the territory of which the debtor’s COMI is situated; or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (x) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested; or (y) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, any territorial insolvency proceedings which were commenced prior to that date shall become secondary insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, the courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings (because the relevant debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of such debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations (such as the preservation of (a) third parties’ right in rem, pursuant to Article 8 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation and (b) sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title, pursuant to Article 10 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation) so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the relevant debtor has assets. In order to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing assets or realization proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that Member State. This, however, is subject to a “qualified majority” (as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims ----- against a debtor arose from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in a Member State other than the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary insolvency proceedings are opened. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus (i.e. the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Following the entry into force of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a debtor’s COMI has shifted in the preceding 3 months, the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Moreover, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (which will no longer be limited only to “winding-up proceedings”) will be possible not only if the relevant debtor has an establishment in such Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if such debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings. Please note that jurisdictions outside the European Union may not require a COMI shift in order for an Irish, Dutch or Maltese incorporated and registered company to initiate insolvency proceedings in those jurisdictions (similar to the UK with respect to schemes of arrangements). However, recognition of any such foreign insolvency proceedings may not be possible in the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands or Malta. In addition, any creditor could institute main insolvency proceeding with respect to the Irish, Dutch or Maltese incorporated and registered companies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Under Article 61 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in the insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group.

Amongst other implications is that, generally speaking, the provisions of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (including, in particular, those providing for automatic, mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings) no longer apply as between the UK and Member States. Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast)), and the 2007 Lugano Convention (on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters), which had previously been considered as potential bases on which UK schemes of arrangement might be recognized in Member States, also generally ceased to apply to the UK. As a result, the issue of whether UK insolvency and restructuring proceedings would be recognized in Member States, and vice versa, has become materially more uncertain and complex. In the UK, there remains a framework for the recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in, and/or judgments of the courts of, a Member State, including under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (subject to the satisfaction of the relevant threshold requirements). Recognition in any Member State of UK insolvency or restructuring proceedings will be a question of the domestic laws of that country, including applicable EU law. Certain Member States have adopted the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which may allow for the recognition of UK insolvency proceedings on a similar basis to UK recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. Depending on the relevant circumstances, UK restructuring proceedings may still be recognized in a Member State under the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, EC Regulation 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I), and/or under private international law rules applicable in that country. In summary, however, recognition of insolvency and restructuring proceedings as between the UK and Member States is no longer automatic and there is increased risk that recognition will not be forthcoming in all relevant jurisdictions. This may necessitate parallel proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, which could result in increased costs, delay and potential inconsistency in approach or outcome.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Under Irish law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from 9 June 2017) with the effect that a charge created as a floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating charge on a winding-up of that company, even if that floating charge has crystallized. Under Section 440 of the Irish Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the Irish Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, VAT, employee-related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation. ----- In addition, there is a further limited category of super-preferential creditors which take priority, not only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These super-preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the Irish courts, (see “— _Examinership” and “SCARP process” below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an_ asset of the company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances, pay as you earn (“PAYE”) and VAT arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created. Furthermore, and as referred to above (see “—Fixed and Floating Charges”), in the case of the application of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a winding-up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The Following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees: _Unfair preference_ Pursuant to Section 604 of the Irish Companies Act, if an Irish company goes into liquidation any payment or any act by it (usually an absolute transfer or a mortgage) relating to property in favor of any creditor or any person on trust for any such creditor which was made or done at a time when that Irish company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due with a view to preferring that creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) over its other creditors and within six months (or two years if that creditor is a “connected person” as defined in Section 559(1) of the Irish Companies Act) before the guarantor became the subject of liquidation proceedings, shall be an unfair preference and invalid. Case law relevant to Section 604 indicates that a dominant intent on the part of the entity concerned to prefer a creditor over its other creditors is necessary in order for Section 604 to apply. Section 604 is only applicable if, at the time of the conveyance, mortgage or other relevant act, the Irish company was unable to pay its debts as they become due. _Improperly transferred assets_ Pursuant to Section 608 of the Irish Companies Act (“Section 608”), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a _fraud” on the company, its creditors or members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to_ do so, order any person who appears to have “use, control or possession” of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge the transfer of assets has been extended to receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair preference for the purposes of Section 604 of the Irish Companies Act. _Disclaimer of onerous contracts_ Under Section 615 of the Irish Companies Act, the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any “unprofitable contract” and “any other property [of the company] which is unsaleable or not readily _saleable by reason of its binding the possessor of it to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money.”_ A liquidator must disclaim the whole of the property, he may not keep part and disclaim part. A disclaimer terminates as and from the date of the disclaimer the rights, interest and liabilities of the company in the contract or the property, but, the disclaimer does not affect the rights or liabilities of any other person, except so far as necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from liability. Any person damaged by ----- the operation of a disclaimer shall be deemed a creditor of the company to the amount of the damages, and may prove that amount as a debt in the winding-up. _Grant of floating charge_ Under Section 597 of the Irish Companies Act, a floating charge is invalid if created in the period of twelve months (or two years if created in favor of a “connected person”) ending with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and unless it can be proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with interest at the appropriate rate. _General_ If an Irish Obligor becomes subject to an Irish law insolvency proceeding and that company has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to the Holders, the Holders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceeding. The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis that it is prohibited under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and unenforceable. Further, guarantees by the Irish Guarantors for the obligations of another group company must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish Guarantors. If the giving of a guarantee is not for the Irish Guarantors’ corporate benefit, the guarantees could be held null and void. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees. The question whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the guarantees could be declared null and void. The validity and/or enforceability of the guarantees may also be subject to the statutes of limitations, defenses such as set-off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of estoppel, and the fact that equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion. Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 of the Irish Companies Act (“Section 82”), it is unlawful for a Irish company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for any shares in the company or its holding company. As a result, the notes may only be guaranteed by the relevant Irish company to the extent that it would not result in such guarantee constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under Section 82. Pursuant to Section 1001 of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over book debts of an Irish tax-resident company may be required by notice from the Irish Revenue Commissioners to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of debts due to it by the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax-resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question. Also, in circumstances where an Irish company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, ----- or certain shareholders of that company may be entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner (as discussed below under “Examinership”).",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The protection period is 70 days from the date of the presentation of the petition (and may be extended by a further 30 days where the Irish High Court is satisfied that the examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further period as the Irish High Court may allow where the Irish High Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the examiner’s final report). In the event of an appeal of the Irish High Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal. Furthermore, the Irish High Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed by the Irish High Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. Further, a company in examinership cannot discharge any liability incurred by it before the presentation to the Irish High Court of a petition for examinership except in strictly defined circumstances. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and certain arrangements entered into by the company after his appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to his appointment. Where possible, an examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement in respect of a company in examinership (the “Proposals”) which the examiner believes will ensure the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. The Proposals will detail, among other things, how each class of creditor is to be treated in the context of the examinership and in particular the dividend, if any, they are to receive. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the Irish High Court when (a) at least a majority in number of creditors, whose interests are impaired under the Proposals, representing a majority in value of the claims that would be impaired by implementation of the Proposals, have voted in favor of the Proposals, or (b) if the abovementioned requirement (a) is not satisfied, then a majority of the classes of creditors whose interest would be impaired by the Proposals have voted to accept them, provided that, at least one of those creditor classes is a class of secured creditors or is senior ----- to the class of ordinary unsecured creditors; or (c) if the abovementioned requirement (b) is not satisfied, at least one class of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by the Proposals, other than a class which would not receive any payment or keep any interest in liquidation, has voted to accept them; and (d) no dissenting creditor would be worse off if the Proposals are confirmed and implemented than such a creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied, either in the event of a liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alterative scenario if the Proposals were not confirmed; and the Proposals are not unfairly prejudicial to any interested party and in any case shall not confirm any Proposals if the sole or primary purpose of them is the avoidance of the payment of tax due. If, for any reason, an examiner was appointed to an Irish Obligor while any amounts due under the Notes were unpaid, the primary risks to the Holders of the Notes would include the following: - there may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of an Irish Obligor of the Notes or the Notes Guarantee and of any payment obligations contained in a guarantee given by any other related company subject to the examinership proceedings; - the trustee, on behalf of the Holders of the Notes, would not be able to initiate proceedings to enforce rights under the Notes Guarantee against the relevant Irish Guarantor during the period of examinership; - a scheme of arrangement may be approved involving the writedown of the debt owed by (a) the relevant Irish Obligor, or (b) a company related to the relevant Irish Obligor to the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the Notes Guarantee irrespective of their views; - an examiner may seek to set aside any negative pledge given by the relevant Irish Obligor prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by that Irish Obligor to enable the examiner to borrow to fund that Irish Obligor during the protection period; and - in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the relevant Irish Obligor subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses and the claims of certain other creditors referred to above (including the Irish Revenue Commissioners in the case of certain unpaid taxes) will take priority over the amounts due by that Irish Obligor under the guarantee to the Holders of the Notes. The European Union (Preventive Restructuring) Regulations 2022 (which implement in Ireland the EU Directive on Preventive Restructuring Frameworks) restricts the exercise (by counterparties of a company in examinership) of certain right (including early termination rights) under contracts during the examinership.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, each relevant Irish Obligor’s center of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the relevant Irish Obligor did not move its registered office within the 3 months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings. As each Irish Obligor’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the relevant Irish Obligor would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute “proof to the contrary” regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ([2004] 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); [2006] IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); [2006] Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that “factors which are _both objective and ascertainable by third parties” would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual_ situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption. If the relevant Irish Obligor’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead. ----- Irish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the Irish Guarantors and any security interests granted by the Irish Guarantors. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Irish insolvency laws relating to certain limitations on the Notes Guarantees and security interests in respect of the Notes, insofar as they are provided by the Irish Obligors. The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes Guarantees or the collateral securing the Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive.

In the event of insolvency of a Dutch company having its center of main interests in the Netherlands, any insolvency proceedings relating to such company would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law. Under certain circumstances, secondary or territorial bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law against companies that are not established under Dutch law provided that such company has an establishment in the Netherlands. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. The third, the Dutch Scheme, allows a debtor to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings such as suspension of payments or bankruptcy. All three insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles of the three insolvency regimes is set out below. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,893,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,893.4,The Netherlands,893.4.2,Suspension of payments,"An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder) and often also a supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for suspension of payments, a court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed by a court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension ends as soon as the court’s decision becomes final. The definitive suspension will generally be granted unless (i) a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent, (ii) there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or (iii) there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The requirement of the debtor having to be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that such creditors must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Suspension of payments has retroactive effect from midnight of the day on which the suspension of payments is declared. Furthermore, the suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in a suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, pursuant to article 241a Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissmentswet) a court may order a “cooling-off period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (and potentially an additional two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will generally be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority of the recognized and of the admitted creditors present or represented at the meeting representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and of the admitted claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by a court. Under certain conditions, a court or supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) (as the case may be) may derogate from this procedure. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,893,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,893.4,The Netherlands,893.4.3,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy can be applied for either by the debtor itself or by a creditor, in each case if the debtor has ceased to pay its debts as they fall due. This is deemed to be the case if the debtor has at least two creditors (at least one of which has a claim that is due and payable and remains unpaid). Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (as described above). Like a suspension of payments, bankruptcy has retroactive effect from midnight of the day on which the bankruptcy is declared. Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a Dutch bankruptcy trustee (curator) and a supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) are appointed. The bankruptcy trustee is charged with the administration and liquidation of the bankruptcy estate and acts under the supervision of the supervisory judge. Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor will be terminated by operation of law and all attachments on the debtor’s assets will be released by operation of law. Legal proceedings to procure payment from the estate that are pending on the date of the bankruptcy order are automatically stayed. ----- The basic principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, creditors with collateral security (zakelijke zekerheidsrechten) over assets in a bankruptcy estate are able to exercise their rights as if no formal insolvency procedure has occurred and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors (such as, but without limitation, the tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. In general, under Dutch law, rights of mortgage and pledge rank above such other rights of priority, including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, this is subject to exceptions. Under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on machinery and inventory (not including stock (voorraden)) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). In addition, a pledgee is obligated to notify the Dutch tax authorities of (i) its intention to exercise its rights under a pledge on movable property (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken) within the meaning of the Tax Collection Act (Invorderingswet 1990), or (ii) its intention to perform, to procure in any way the performance of, or cooperate with any legal of factual act with respect to such property which could prejudice the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right to such property. Following such notification, a statutory waiting period of up to four weeks starting from the date of notification has to be observed. In the four weeks following such notification, the pledgee may not exercise its security rights in respect of such assets or perform any action with respect to such assets which could prejudice the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right. During this waiting period, the Dutch tax authorities may exercise their priority right in respect of specific property for certain tax debts (bodemvoorrecht). Failure to notify the Dutch tax authorities, or the exercise of its security rights within the aforementioned waiting period in the manner contemplated in subclause (i) or (ii) above, may result in the pledgee having to pay to the Dutch tax authorities an amount equal to the value of the relevant assets or—in the case of an enforcement—the proceeds derived from the enforcement, provided that the amount payable shall not exceed the amount of the relevant taxes due, regardless of whether such taxes have already assessed or not. After the four-week waiting period has lapsed, or upon an earlier notification by the Dutch tax authorities that they will not exercise their priority right, a pledgee may exercise its security rights. However, the pledgee may only exercise such security rights during the four weeks following the lapse of the waiting period, or the date of the notification from the Dutch tax authorities, as the case may be. After the fourweek period has ended, the aforementioned limitations are applicable again and the pledgee will only be able to exercise its security rights with respect to such property, after a new notification to the Dutch tax authorities and observance of a new waiting period. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy trustee to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the bankruptcy trustee determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent the claim will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that are due and payable by their terms within one year of the date of the bankruptcy of an Issuer or security grantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. The valuation of claims that would not have been payable within one year from the date of the bankruptcy may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified, unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted _pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatie vergadering), the bankruptcy trustee, the insolvent debtor and all provisionally verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). Such separate court procedures could also cause payments to the holders of the Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. If it is likely that there will be insufficient assets in the bankruptcy estate to distribute to the unsecured creditors, the bankruptcy judge may decide, at the request of the bankruptcy trustee, that it will not be necessary to deal with the unsecured claims and that there will not be a meeting at which claims are admitted or rejected. If the bankruptcy estate is sufficient to make a distribution to unsecured nonpreferential creditors, remaining amounts after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the positively verified unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. ----- Pursuant to article 138 Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall in general be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of the unsecured non-preferential creditors present or represented at the meeting, with admitted and provisionally admitted claims representing at least 50% of the total amount of the admitted and provisionally admitted unsecured non preferential claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Under certain conditions, the supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) may derogate from this procedure. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors in liquidation compositions. Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated differently from creditors that are incorporated or residing in the Netherlands. As mentioned above, secured creditors which have a right in rem (goederenrechtelijke rechten) may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling-off period” (afkoelingsperiode) on the basis of article 63a Dutch Bankruptcy Act for a maximum of two months during (and potentially an additional two months) which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, the bankruptcy trustee may force a secured creditor to realize its security right by giving the creditor notice to do so within a reasonable time. A failure to take recourse by the creditor will result in the creditor forfeiting its rights to enforce its security rights, albeit that its claim shall continue to be preferred. However, in such an event the creditor must contribute to costs of the bankruptcy which may be considerable. Any excess proceeds of enforcement and for which there is no valid security right must be returned to the bankruptcy estate and may not be off set to any unsecured claims against the debtor. Lastly, the bankruptcy trustee may force the secured creditor to hand the proceeds of certain pledged assets (bodemzaken) over to the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of the Dutch tax authorities pursuant to Article 57 (3) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, the provision of security or an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its bankruptcy trustee. This can occur if (i) the insolvent debtor performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the creditor concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the insolvent debtor and (unless the act was for no consideration (om niet)) the party with whom or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. For the bankruptcy trustee, knowledge of prejudice is presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. In addition, in case of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may nullify the debtor’s performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against an Issuer being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan ----- under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the noteholders. Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert. The WHOA could therefore have an adverse effect on the ability of noteholders to recover payments due on the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Furthermore, under Dutch law, a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances suspend performance of its obligations under such agreement pursuant to the _exceptio non-adimpleti contractus or otherwise. Other impeding factors include a dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). The enforceability of the obligations of an Issuer may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs. Pursuant to Dutch law it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the security documents pursuant to which a security interest will be granted in the assets of a Dutch company could use a parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch company, as separate and independent obligations, undertakes to pay to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate and independent claim of the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured by a security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the creditors. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel debt provision that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa). A Dutch security interest can only serve as security for monetary claims (geldvorderingen) and be enforced upon default (verzuim) of the obligations secured thereby. Foreclosure on pledged property must be carried out in accordance with applicable provisions and limitations in the Netherlands Civil Code ----- (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Netherlands Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke _Rechtsvordering)._ Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by a Dutch company under a security interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest. The validity and enforceability of a security interest granted by or in, a Dutch company may also be successfully contested by that Dutch company (or their bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of a Dutch company under a security interest may also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the company’s respective bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy when the company is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under the Netherlands Civil Code and Netherlands Bankruptcy Act are met. As a result, the value of the security interests provided by the Issuer may be limited. Pursuant to Article 2:7 of the Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), any transaction entered into by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy if the objects of that entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek moest weten). The Dutch Supreme Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal entity are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association (statuten) is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether the subsistence of the company is jeopardized by the transaction. Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of bankruptcy. Pursuant to the Dutch actio pauliana provisions, legal acts performed by a natural or legal debtor can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant debtor and may be nullified by the liquidator in bankruptcy or by any creditor of that debtor outside bankruptcy, if: (i) such debtor performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the concerned creditor or, in the case of bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the relevant debtor and the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. This is different if the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet), in which case such knowledge by the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. The liability of the Issuer under the relevant security documents, will be limited to the amount that will result in such security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of the Issuer. There is a possibility that the entire security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to find that the guaranteeing of the Notes, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under such security documents are ineffective, could void the security over the collateral, or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Issuer and would be a creditor solely of a Guarantor, any other guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Notes Guarantee or Security Documents that have not been declared void. In case a pre-insolvency plan has been submitted or a restructuring expert has been appointed, the debtor may submit a request to the court to sanction a legal act that was granted without a prior existing obligation to do so (onverplicht) as described above. Such acts could be obtaining new financing, granting security or disposing of certain assets or group companies. If the court sanctions such act, it can no longer be nullified because of fraudulent conveyance in a subsequent bankruptcy. The court will sanction such legal act in case (i) such acts were necessary to continue the enterprise of the debtor during the preparation of the pre-insolvency plan, (ii) such acts were necessary to prepare, submit for voting or confirm a preinsolvency plan, or (iii) such acts are for the benefit of the creditors jointly, while no individual creditor’s interest have been significantly negatively impacted. ----- The general terms and conditions of Dutch banks applicable to bank accounts held in the Netherlands often provide for a restriction on the creation of security over bank account receivables in favor of third parties. As a result, it may not be possible to create security over bank accounts held in the Netherlands unless prior consent has been obtained from the relevant account bank. Without such consent there may be no valid security over the Dutch bank accounts. In addition, also if the consent has been granted and a valid security right has been created, such security is subject to a right of pledge and right of set-off of the account bank based on the General Banking Conditions (Algemene Bankvoorwaarden), unless such rights of pledge and set-off have been waived by the relevant account bank. In the event of the occurrence of certain events, the Security Agent may enforce the security interests created pursuant to the relevant security documents governed by Dutch law. A secured creditor may, in principle, enforce its security as if there are no insolvency proceedings. This is subject to limited exceptions, including that (i) the court may impose a moratorium which may not exceed four months, during which pledgees may not exercise their rights, (ii) the liquidator in bankruptcy may fix a period within which the pledgee must exercise their rights. If the pledgee does not enforce its security rights during this period, the trustee in bankruptcy will become exclusively entitled to enforcement. However, even in such a situation, the pledgee will retain its priority in respect of the proceeds but will need to contribute pro rata to the general bankruptcy costs. The same applies in situations where there is a suspension of payment, and (iii) a court may suspend, for a period not exceeding eight months, enforcement of security rights against a pledgor in relation to which statutory proceedings for the restructuring of debts (akkoordprocedure) have been started. In general, under Dutch insolvency law mortgages and pledges rank above other rights of priority (other than senior ranking security and other liens), including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory pledge on inventory (not including stock) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme, now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Under Dutch law the following rules generally apply to the enforcement of a pledge. A pledge must be enforced in one of the following four ways, being (i) a public sale ('auction'), (ii) a private sale by the pledgee to a third party (a) either with the consent of the pledgor and any other interested party (such as the holder of a junior ranking pledge, or conservatory or executory attachment), or (b) with the approval of the competent court, (iii) accrual of the pledged asset to the pledgee (‘appropriation’) with the approval of the competent court for a price determined by that court, or (iv) in the event of rights of pledge on receivables, by collecting the receivables and having recourse against the amounts so collected. A public auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Netherlands Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met _beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and_ the relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge on claims can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the claims) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the New EU Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted by domestic law and shall include any subordinate ----- legislation made from time to time under that EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA. On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a Member State, including for the purpose of the New EU Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a Member State. The New EU Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and paragraph 1, schedule 5, European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) (the “Insolvency Amendment",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The courts of England and Wales would have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company. In addition, the UK Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) in Great Britain and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world without any condition of ----- reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on the Issue Date and the Notes will be secured by security interests over the Collateral as soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date, and in any event within 25 business days of the Issue Date. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable or if the following would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a ----- whole, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined herein) granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see “—Priority on insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (see further below). If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Accordingly, if any of the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

An administrator can also be appointed out of ----- court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29 of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended)), as set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Priority on insolvency” below).",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than ----- floating security interests will depend on, among others, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors would be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the court’s sanction order to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject or refuse to sanction the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration. A scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third-parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it ----- will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. A simple majority of the company’s members must also have voted in favor of the proposal. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the shareholders should prevail.

In the case of compulsory liquidation, even if a foreign company has neither its COMI or an establishment in the UK, it may be wound up as an unregistered company if the court considers there to be (i) a sufficient connection with England and Wales, (ii) a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (iii) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise a jurisdiction. Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined herein) and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. ----- Once the winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,893,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,893.6,Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the,893.6.13,Priority on insolvency,"One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a priorranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a_ class. As an exception to the principle of _pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only; ----- - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge; - Seventh ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that ----- all categories above are fully paid. This, however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.

In most cases this will only arise if the company enters administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) after the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it. _Onset of insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is made, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests: ----- _Transaction at an undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings. In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees, although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by the court may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) except where that person was a party to the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or guarantee was granted within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to the same principles as are described above with respect to transactions at an undervalue). However, the court will only make such an order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the ----- preference, the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and that it was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption of insolvency). _Transaction defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above) and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the Notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Grant of floating charge_ Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company within the period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge ----- or as a consequence thereof, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating charge will be invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part or in full) the relevant floating charge; any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating charge will not be invalidated on this basis. As referred to above (see “—Fixed and floating charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterised as a floating charge. If purported fixed charge security that is subsequently recharacterised has been granted within the relevant suspect period referred to above, this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the consideration provided.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

However, the EUWA provided for the New EU Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the New EU Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings. The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP Day New EU Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and: - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the UK; or - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. These tests are consistent with the New EU Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the UK court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (a) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (b) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration. While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings”).",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework. If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations, certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which (amongst other things) remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply certain provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors in administration or liquidation and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interest applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Some of,893.8.7,Limitation on enforcement,"The grant of a guarantee or security by an English company in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most ----- likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the Supreme Court has recently held that it takes place when the company in question is insolvent or bordering on insolvency, or when an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable. Security and/or guarantees granted by an English obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law, including Sections 678 to 679 of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended). Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days beginning with the day after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies.

Some of,893.8.8,Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings,"_General position_ The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions. One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the CrossBorder Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are not regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). ----- The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter position). _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in Member States. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in Member States. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a Member State. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Some of,893.8.9,,"these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following: (a) _Moratorium The 2020 Insolvency Act introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain ----- financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The 2020 Insolvency Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “— _Administration,” “—Administration, administrative receivership and floating charges,” “—Avoidance of transactions—Grant of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In_ contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. ----- A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). (b) _Ipso Facto clauses prohibited The 2020 Insolvency Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new prohibition. (c) _Restructuring plan The 2020 Insolvency Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), ----- recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette).",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Further, while Gibraltar previously formed part of the European Union pursuant to the United Kingdom’s membership and therefore left the same upon Brexit, an intended treaty is currently under negotiation regarding Gibraltar’s future relationship with the European Union (envisaged to involve some form of Schengen Acquis) and there are also elements of preBrexit European Union law that have been retained in Gibraltar (including certain European Union Directives transposed into Gibraltar law during such time that Gibraltar formed part of it). Each and any of these features could potentially impact upon if and how matters may be capable of or ultimately enforced per Gibraltar law and/or in a Gibraltar Court. The fact that Gibraltar is a common law jurisdiction (and in the absence of alternative Gibraltar statutory or judicial provision or requirement, English common law may apply in Gibraltar) could also impact upon this, and is again the reason why many of the principles and considerations set out in the England and Wales “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of _Guarantees and Security and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” section may similarly apply in_ relation to the Gibraltar Guarantor subject to certain Gibraltar law nuances (see “—England and Wales”).

The available measures contemplated by means of the Maltese Companies Act aim to have the business able to pay off all its debts rather than proceedings to insolvent liquidation of the company. The following procedures are contemplated in the Maltese Companies Act: _1._ _Compromise or Arrangement and Voluntary Mediation_ In terms of Maltese law, in the event that a company is unable to pay its debts or, in the opinion of the courts, there are grounds of sufficient gravity that would warrant the dissolution and consequential winding up of the company, the company may propose a compromise with its creditors or members. Where a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a company and its creditors, or any class of them, or between the company and its members, or any class of them: (a) the court may, on the application of the company or any creditor or member of it or, in the case of a company being wound up, the liquidator, order a meeting of the creditors, or of the members of the company or class of members, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the court directs; or ----- (b) the company or any creditor, with the sanction of not less than two-thirds of the creditors or class of creditors, may seek the appointment of a mediator in terms of article 20 of the Mediation Act, and such mediation shall organize a meeting of the creditors, or class of creditors, as the case may be, in order for such creditors and the company to reach a compromise or arrangement. The principles under the Mediation Act shall apply. If a majority in number representing two-thirds in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members, as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting called in terms of this sub-section, agree to any compromise or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement, if sanctioned by the court, shall be binding on all creditors or the class of creditors or on the members or class of members, as the case may be, and also on the company or, in the case of a company in the course of being wound up, on the liquidator and contributories of the company. In the event that a written agreement containing a compromise or arrangement is agreed and executed at a meeting following the appointment of a mediator such arrangement shall likewise be binding _on all creditors, and also on the company or, in the case of a company in the course of being wound up, on_ the liquidator. The said agreement by which a compromise has been reached shall be delivered to the Registrar and annexed to every copy of the company’s memorandum issued thereafter. _2._ _Company Recovery Procedure_ The Company Recovery Procedure, in terms of Maltese law, provides a company in financial difficulty with an opportunity to rehabilitate its business. Notably, the Company Recovery Procedure is provided to Maltese companies in terms of Article 329B of the Maltese Companies Act wherein it is stipulated that where a company is unable to pay its debts or is imminently likely to become unable to pay its debts, a company recovery application may be made to the Court requesting the Court to place the company under the company recovery procedure and to appoint a special controller to take over, manage and administer the business of the company for a period to be specified by the Court. Having said this, no application may be submitted by a company after it has been dissolved voluntarily or if a winding-up order has already been made. A company recovery application (hereinafter referred to as the “Application”), shall be made by means of an Application which may be made: (i) by the company following an extraordinary resolution; (ii) by the directors following a decision of the board of directors whenever, following a notice to convene a general meeting in terms of Article 329A of the Maltese Companies Act (as provided below), the general meeting does not convene, or a quorum is not present at the said meeting, or a resolution with regard to the filing of a recovery Application is not passed due to an unresolved tie following a vote; or (iii) by creditors of the company representing more than half in value of the company’s creditors; or (iv) by creditors forming part of a class of creditors if such creditors represent more than half in value of the company’s creditors in that class. The appointment of a special controller shall be made for a period not exceeding four months; provided that, at any time during which the company recovery procedure is in force, the court may, upon good cause being shown, extend the period by further periods of four months, provided that the aggregate additional periods do not exceed a further eight months. The Application shall, as far as possible, give the full facts, circumstances and reasons which led to the company’s inability or likely imminent inability to pay its debts, together with a statement by the applicants as to how the financial and economic situation of the company can be improved in the interests of its creditors, employees and of the company itself as a viable going concern. Where an Application is made by the company, the following documents shall be annexed to it: (i) a statement of the company’s assets and liabilities made up to a date not earlier than the date of the Application by more than two months; and (ii) a list containing the names and addresses, including electronic mail addresses, of the creditors together with an indication of the amount due to each such creditor and the security, if any, of the respective creditors. ----- While, where the Application is made by the creditors, it shall be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation and statements. On the hearing of an Application, the Court may, after examining all the circumstances and the options that are available, either dismiss the Application or issue a company recovery order (hereinafter also referred to as an “Order”), acceding thereto and placing the company under the company recovery procedure. In this regard, the Court shall accede to the Application, and accordingly place the company under the company recovery procedure and issue an Order, only if: (i) it is satisfied that the company is, or is imminently likely to become, unable to pay its debts; and (ii) if it considers that the making of the Order would be likely to following purposes: the survival of the company as a viable going concern in part or in whole; or the sanctioning of a compromise or arrangement between the company and any of its creditors or members. In making an Order, the Court shall take into account, (i) the best interests of the creditors, regard being had to the different classes of creditors, of the shareholders and of the company itself, and the possibility of safeguarding employment as appears to be reasonably and financially possible in the circumstances; and (ii) the cost that would have to be incurred by adopting the company recovery procedure, particularly the fees and charges that would have to be incurred. Notably, the Court shall take its decision whether to dismiss the application or to make a company recovery order within not more than forty working _days from the filing of the application._ Where the company is in possession of a license or other authorization under the laws regulating banking, insurance, investment services, financial institutions or listing of securities on a Maltese regulated market, the court shall not proceed to make an Order without first having consulted with the relevant competent authority responsible for supervising that company or any of its activities (for example the MGA for a company holding a gaming license in Malta). Once the Order is acceded to and the company recovery procedure is in force, any pending winding up application and execution of claims against the company shall be stayed. An investor is therefore impeded during this period from taking any steps to enforce any claim over the property of the company or from filing any precautionary or executive act or warrant or commence judicial proceedings, except with leave of Court. In addition, once the Order is acceded to and the company recovery procedure is in force, the company shall continue to carry on its normal activities under the management of the special controller. The special controller may not, without prior express authorization from the Court, (i) engage the company into any commitment of more than six months, (ii) terminate the employment of company employees as he considers necessary for the continuation of the company as a viable going concern, or (iii) sell or dispose of any property of the company to himself, or to his spouse or relatives and the provisions of Article 306 of the Maltese Companies Act shall apply as though references to the liquidator are references to the special controller. Finally, the Company Recovery Procedure shall terminate once it results to the special controller that it would serve no useful purpose for the company to continue with the said procedure or that the affairs of the company have improved to the extent that it is in a position to pay its debts, the special controller will apply to the Court for the termination of the procedure. The Court will issue an order for the termination of the company recovery procedure and order for the company to be wound up by the Court if the company has no reasonable prospect of continuing as a viable going concern and will not be in a position to pay its debts in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

If no such exception is made, a person who benefits from such disposition shall be liable personally in terms of the Maltese Companies Act. Notably, no matter the liability associated to the transaction, any transaction at an undervalue and/or preference will be deemed to be a fraudulent preference and will be rendered null and void. A company enters into a voidable transaction at an undervalue if the company makes any gift or similar transaction which the company enters into on the terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration, or the company enters into a transaction for a consideration the value of which is significantly less than the value of the consideration provided by the company. While a company gives a voidable preference to a person if that person is one of the company’s creditors, surety, or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; and the company does anything or suffers anything to be done which has the effect of putting that person into a better position than such person would have had if the preference had not occurred. Where anything made or done preceding the insolvency of a company is void under Article 303 as a fraudulent preference of a person interested in property privileged, hypothecated or otherwise charged to secure the company’s debt, then, a claimant must institute a further action in front of the Maltese courts to subject the person preferred to the same liabilities and such preferred person shall have the same rights as if he had undertaken to be personally liable as surety for the debt to the extent of the charge on the property or the value of his interest, whichever is the less. In addition, the value of the preferred person’s interest shall be determined as at the date of the transaction constituting the fraudulent preference, and shall be determined as if the interest were free of all encumbrances or burdens other than those to which the charge for the company’s debt was then subject. Notably, on any application made to the court with respect to any payment on the ground that the payment was a fraudulent preference of a surety or guarantor, the court may determine any questions with respect to the payment arising between the person to whom the payment was made and the surety or guarantor and to grant relief in respect thereto. As an alternative to filing proceedings relating to the fraudulent preference rules, Article 1144 of the Civil Code, also provides the creditor with the option of filing an action to impeach any act made by his debtor in fraud of his claims (referred to as the “Maltese Actio Pauliana”). The Maltese Actio Pauliana would allow the creditor to seek to be placed in an equivalent status as they were prior to the fraud. However, the effects of a successful application of the Maltese Actio Pauliana do not serve to restore the debtor company’s pool of assets from where the creditors will be paid according to their ranking at law, but rather the action benefits only the creditor who seeks to impeach the fraud. When an acts giving rise to the fraud alleged by the creditor take the form of an onerous nature in order to successfully impeach the fraudulent action of the debtor, the creditor must prove fraud on both parties to the transaction. On the other hand, when the act takes the form of a gratuitous title it is sufficient for the creditor to prove fraud on part of the debtor. It is also relevant to point out that while an action for fraudulent preference may be instituted only following in the course of the winding up of a company, the Maltese Actio Pauliana may be instituted at any time after the creditor discovers the fraudulent act.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

These are referred to as the “liquidity test” and the “balance sheet test,” as each are defined in Article 214 (5) of the Maltese Companies Act. These tests may be applied by the Court independently of each other. The former refers to the situation were a debt due by the company has remained unsatisfied in whole or in part after twenty weeks from the enforcement of an executive title against the company by any executive act, then the company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts, and would have failed the liquidity test. This would be a ground for the Court to order the dissolution of the company. The latter refers to the situation were if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts, account being taken also of contingent and prospective liabilities of the company, then the company shall also be deemed unable to pay its debts. For Dissolution and Winding Up, a company needs to satisfy one of these two tests. For a Company Recovery Procedure, it is enough for the company to be likely to fail any one of the tests in the near future. ----- Moreover, a prerequisite for the court to be able to apply this test is that the company’s financial statements would have to be updated regularly. If the company fails to present financial statements, a matter which combined with other considerations may bring about personal liability of the directors as well as penalties in terms of the Maltese Companies Act, then the Court would be unable to apply the balance sheet test.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

In the liquidation process, the liquidator would realize the assets of the company being wound-up and distribute the net proceeds according to the ranking and admitted claims of the creditors. The ordinary creditors within this ranking will have their share distributed to them on a _pari passu basis, which principle renders inoperative all agreements which would give unfair preference to particular creditors. In terms of Article 1995 of the Civil Code (Chapter 16 of the Laws of Malta), the property of a debtor is the common guarantee of his creditors, all of whom have an equal right over such property unless there exists between them lawful causes of preference or there shall have been a transfer under a security trust for such purpose in accordance with inter alia Article 2095E of the Civil Code. Therefore, when a company is insolvent the liquidator would distribute the assets of the company in a pro rata manner among its creditors, as per Article 287 of the Maltese Companies Act. Article 22 of the Maltese Companies Act freezes the pursuit of individual debt enforcement remedies against insolvent companies being wound-up, in favor of collective actions by the creditors as an entity. Article 222 stipulates that “[w]hen a company is being wound-up by the court, any act or warrant, _whether precautionary or executive, other than a warrant of prohibitory injunction, issued or carried into_ effect against the company after the date of its deemed dissolution, shall be void.”_ Moreover, Article 224(2) of the Maltese Companies Act has the same effect of not allowing any individual action for payment against the insolvent company being wound-up by the court, as it provides that “[w]here a winding-up order has _been made or a provisional administrator has been appointed in accordance with the provisions of article 228, no action or proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company or its property except by the leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose.”_ The notion of _pari passu is subject to various exceptions, in instances where there are secured creditors who lawfully enjoy a preference over other creditors. As per Article 302 of the Maltese Companies Act, in the event of the insolvent liquidation of a company where the assets of the company are insufficient to meet all its liabilities, the rights of secured and unsecured creditors and the priority and ranking of their debts shall be regulated by the law in force at the time. Therefore, the liquidator must declare and distribute what he has realized from the company assets among the creditors in respect of the debts which they have respectively proved in an order of priority determined by law as Article 238(1)(c) of the Maltese Companies Act affords the power to the liquidator of a company in winding-up to pay creditors according to their ranking at law. However, ranking may be influenced by various techniques adopted by creditors such as securities or subordination. Besides the prior ranking of certain creditors in virtue of specific security interests which may be contractually granted in their favor by the company over some or all of its assets, certain other prior ranking/senior claims or securities may arise by operation of law. Article 293 of the Maltese Companies Act provides that “All costs, charges and expenses properly incurred in the winding-up, including the _remuneration of the liquidator, shall be payable out of the assets of the company in priority to all other claims, and they shall, in so far as applicable, be paid in the order of priority established under article 258 of this Act unless the Court otherwise directs.”_ Article 258 of the Maltese Companies Act provides that if the company being wound-up is so insolvent that its assets are insufficient to fully pay all the liquidation expenses, then court may make an order as to their payment. This article states as follows: _The court may, in the event of the assets being insufficient to satisfy the liabilities, make an order as to the payment out of the assets of the costs, charges and expenses incurred in the dissolution and winding-up in such order of priority as the court thinks fit._ ----- _(2)_ _In so doing the court shall have regard to the following general order of priority – i._ _expenses properly chargeable or incurred by the official receiver or the liquidator in preserving, realizing or collecting any of the assets of the company; ii._ _any other expenses incurred or disbursements made by the official receiver or under his authority, including those incurred or made in carrying on the business of the company; iii._ _the remuneration of the provisional administrator, if any; iv._ _any necessary disbursements by the special controller in the course of his office in terms of articles 329A and 329B; v._ _the remuneration of the special controller; vi._ _the costs of the applicant, and of any person appearing on the application whose costs are allowed by the court; vii._ _the remuneration of the special manager, if any; viii._ _any amount payable to a person employed or authorized to assist in the preparation of a statement of affairs or of account; ix._ _any allowance made by order of the court, towards costs on an application for release from the obligation to submit a statement of affairs, or for an extension of time for submitting such a statement; x._ _any necessary disbursements by the liquidator in the course of his administration, including any expenses incurred by members of the liquidation committee or their representatives and allowed by the liquidator; xi._ _the remuneration of any person employed by the liquidator to perform any services for the company, as required or authorized by the provisions of this Act; xii._ _the remuneration of the official receiver and of the liquidator; xiii._ _any new financing granted to the company for the purpose of a recovery procedure in terms of articles 329A and 329B._ In addition to the above, claims of the Commissioner for Revenue for Value Added Tax as well as claims for income tax and social contributions deductible from employees’ wages would rank in preference to other general claims, whilst, also claims from employees for example, such as claims for salaries, holiday pay or pension contributions would also be treated with preference over claims made by non-ranking creditors. This rule emerges from Article 20 of the Employment and Industrial Relations Act, Chapter 452 of the Laws of Malta, which provides that a claim by any employee shall constitute a privileged claim over the assets of the employer and shall be paid in preference to all other claims. Claims which rank higher are usually the ones listed above. Ultimately it would be up to the competent court to decide on the ranking of such debts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Members Voluntary Winding Up b. Creditors Voluntary Winding Up c. Court Winding Up. _A._ _Members Voluntary Winding Up_ A Members’ Voluntary Winding Up takes place after an extraordinary resolution is passed by the members to put the company in Dissolution. The Dissolution, that is the decision of the company to start the liquidation process, triggers the Winding Up of the company. In a Members’ Voluntary Winding Up, the liquidation takes place under the control of a Liquidator appointed by the shareholders, and only in cases where the company is solvent. For Insolvent liquidation, there are specific procedural rules which need to be followed, amongst which rules on the appointment of the liquidator at the hands of the Creditors as outlined in point b below. In the case of a Members’ Voluntary Winding Up, a “Declaration of Solvency,” which must be signed by the majority of the Directors, must be filed at the Malta Business Registry. This Declaration of Solvency is a very important statement in which the majority of the Directors declare that they have made a full inquiry into the affairs of the company, and that they have formed the opinion that the company will be able to pay off its liabilities in full within the period specified in the Declaration, but not exceeding 12 months. _B._ _Creditors Voluntary Winding Up_ In the event of a Voluntary Winding Up in which a Declaration of Solvency, as outlined in point A above, has not been made is to be considered as a Creditors Voluntary Winding Up in terms of article 268 (5) of the Maltese Companies Act. It is to be noted that although it is referred to as a “Creditors’ Voluntary Winding Up,” it is not the Creditors who initiate the Winding Up process. This can be initiated by the shareholders pursuant to article 278 of the Maltese Companies Act through a resolution of the company or by the liquidator in a Members’ Voluntary Winding Up if it turns out during the course of the liquidation that the company will not be able to pay its debts within the period stated in the Declaration of Solvency. In a Creditors’ Voluntary Winding up, it is the Creditors who nominate and appoint the liquidator. However, in line with article 279 of the Maltese Companies Act, in those cases where the creditors fail to nominate a liquidator during the meeting of creditors called for such a purpose, the person nominated by the company would become liquidator. In the scenario that a liquidator is not appointed an application for the appointment of the same shall be filed in court by any Director of the company within 14 days pursuant to provision 279 (2) of the Maltese Companies Act. ----- _C._ _Court Winding Up_ Maltese company law allows for an application to be made for the dissolution and winding up of a company in court. A court winding up may be initiated by making a request to the court either by the company following a decision of a general meeting, or by its board of directors, or by any debenture holder, creditor or contributor. In line with Article 214 of the Maltese Companies Act, a company may be dissolved and wound up by the Court: if an extraordinary resolution for Dissolution and consequent Winding Up by the Court is passed; if the business of the company is suspended for an uninterrupted period of twenty-four months and if the company is unable to pay its debts. On the other hand, a company shall be dissolved by the Court and wound up either voluntarily or by the Court: if there are less than 2 members for more than 6 months (does not apply to single member companies); if there are less than 2 Directors in public companies or 1 in private companies; if there are grounds of sufficient gravity and f the period fixed for the duration of the company expires. The court will consider the application, and in the process, it shall consider the views of all the interested parties. In the interim, before arriving at a decision whether to dissolve the company or otherwise, it may provide for the appointment of a Provisional Administrator who would take over the overall administration of the company’s business, oversee and preserve the assets of the company and prevent anyone from taking any unfair priority or advantage. The Court also has the authority, before deciding whether to dissolve the company or otherwise, to stay any procedures against the company. When the company is insolvent, the Directors have an obligation towards creditors. Any prejudice to their rights may lead to serious consequences, including personal liability, fines and in cases where there is deliberate fraud, even imprisonment. In the event that in the course of a Winding up Application it is claimed that the Malta company is indeed insolvent, the Maltese courts would accede to the request of the applicant once the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Court that either (a) the debt due by the company has remained unsatisfied in whole or in part after twenty-four weeks from the enforcement of an executive title against the company, or (b) that the company is unable to pay its debts, account being taken also of contingent and prospective liabilities of the company. Following a winding up order, the Maltese courts will draw up a list of contributories and will cause the assets of the company to be collected and applied in the discharge of the company’s liabilities. The court may, before or after it has ascertained the sufficiency of the assets of the company, make calls on all or any contributory to the extent of their liability, for payment of any money which is necessary to satisfy the debts and liabilities of the company including expenses relating to its winding up. Following an order by the Court for the Dissolution of the company, the powers of the Directors cease and representation of the company becomes solely vested in the liquidator in line with Article 295 of the Maltese Companies Act and the company shall cease to undertake any business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

A company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (as defined in section 95A of the Australian Corporations Act). The purpose of an administration is to provide for the business, property and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way that maximizes the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence or, if that is not possible, results in a better return for the company's creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company. The appointed voluntary administrator must investigate the company's business, property and affairs and convene a meeting for creditors of the company to vote on one of the following outcomes: the company to execute a deed of company arrangement (see further below); the administration to end; or the company to be wound up (see further “—Liquidation/winding up” below). Certain rights of creditors are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and except with the written consent of the administrator or the leave of the court the institution or continuation of legal process against the company or property of the company is not permitted. A deed of company arrangement is a binding arrangement between a company and its creditors in relation to how the company's property and affairs will be dealt with after the company enters into administration. The purpose of a deed of company arrangement is to maximize the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence, or to result in a better return to creditors than would be the case in an immediate winding up of the company. The priority in which creditor claims are paid depends upon the terms of the deed of company arrangement. However, the deed of company arrangement must provide for employees to have priority over unsecured creditors of the company (see further “—Priority on liquidation” below), unless employees have agreed otherwise. The stay on the commencement or continuation of proceedings, or any enforcement process, against a company or in relation to the company's property, continues while the company is subject to a deed of company arrangement. Accordingly, if any Guarantor incorporated in Australia were to enter into administration, the Guarantees could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Australian Corporations Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a security interest).",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Preferential debts are listed in order in the PPA 1908 as follows: (i) any amount owed by the debtor in respect of an eligible protected deposit; (ii) all debts due to the Crown or to any person on behalf of the Crown; (iii) all rates having become due the payable within the past 12 months; (iv) wages and salaries owed to employees for a prescribed period and to a prescribed amount; (v) accrued holiday pay to employees; (vi) certain sums sue to apprentices and articled clerks and reserve armed forces; (vii) national insurance contributions owed by the debtors in the past 12 months prior to insolvency; (viii) sums in respect of occupational pension scheme contributions and state scheme premiums.

The thing done or suffered will be liable to be set aside if at the time it was done or suffered that company was unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 163 of the 1931 Act or became unable to pay its debts within the meaning of that section in consequence of the thing done or suffered and that thing has the effect of putting any person in a better position, in the event of that company going into insolvent liquidation, than that person would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered. However, the Isle of Man court will not make such an order unless it is proved that the thing was done or suffered to be done with the substantial or dominant view of giving that person a preference over other creditors. (Unlike the hardening provisions in the U.K. insolvency legislation, the relevant Isle of Man legislation does not recognize the concept of connected persons.) _Fraudulent transactions_ By virtue of section 4 of the Isle of Man Fraudulent Assignments Act 1736, an assignment or disposition of property by a company entered into with a view to defrauding creditors is void and of no effect. This provision may be used at any time by a creditor whether or not the relevant company is in liquidation. The Isle of Man courts have held that transactions will only be void under the Fraudulent Assignments Act 1736 if there is an intention to defraud creditors and that it will be a question of fact in each case whether or not the transaction is bona fide or “a contrivance to defraud creditors.” However, a transaction will be void if it is entered into when the debtor is insolvent or with the intent to leave a debtor insolvent and unable to pay creditors. Transactions entered into on an arm’s length basis are unlikely to constitute transactions which are capable of being avoided under this statute. Isle of Man case law indicates that a trustee in bankruptcy can bring a claim under this provision on the basis that the trustee is agent for the creditors so it appears likely that, by analogy, a liquidator of the Manx Guarantor could also do so. _Floating Charges_ Pursuant to section 251 of the 1931 Act, where a company is being wound up, any floating charge created by it within six months of the commencement of the winding up shall be invalid unless it can be proved that such company was solvent immediately after the creation of the floating charge or except to the extent of any new consideration provided to it. _Onerous Property_ A liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective ----- liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors.

An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest in the property to the chargee but retains legal title to the property. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable remedies or are otherwise at the discretion of the court. Security created by a charge over assets will often be enforced by the lender by appointing a receiver over the asset. There are no statutory powers for receivers under Isle of Man insolvency law. Therefore, a person will only have the power to appoint a receiver (and the receiver will only have such powers) as the terms of the relevant security documentation give it as a matter of contract. Provided the drafting of the security document allows, the appointment of a receiver under the security agreement can be made without the leave of court and the receiver will have power to collect in any income from the asset and to sell it. If the charge does not permit the appointment of a receiver, or if the lender chooses not to exercise this power, the lender can sue for the covenanted debt and a coroner (an officer of the court of the Isle of Man) will be authorized by the court to sell the charged assets at public auction without reserve in accordance with statutory procedure (under the Isle of Man Administration of Justice Act 1981). _Security over bank accounts_ With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by the Manx Guarantor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that Guarantor. As a result, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. _Recharacterization of fixed security interests_ There is a possibility that the Isle of Man court could find that any of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by Isle of Man law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interest is recharacterized as floating security interest, this can affect the priority of the security interest under Isle of Man insolvency law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

If a charge is not registered within the one month period, an administrative application can be made to the Companies Registry prior to the start of any winding up procedures.

There is no treaty between Ireland and the United States providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. In order to enforce a monetary judgment obtained in the United States in Ireland, separate proceedings have to be issued seeking an Irish judgment in the terms of the U.S. judgment. A summary procedure is available in circumstances where an applicant can establish that: - the U.S. judgment is for a definite sum; - the U.S. judgment is final and conclusive; and - the U.S. judgment is of a court which, as a matter of Irish law, is of competent jurisdiction. Even if the matters referred to above are established by an applicant, an Irish court may on certain grounds refuse to enforce the U.S. judgment. These grounds include: - the U.S. judgment having being obtained by fraud; - the U.S. judgment violating Irish public policy or constituting a judgment of a penal or revenue (tax) nature; - the U.S. judgment being in breach of natural justice or constitutional justice under the laws of Ireland; - the U.S. judgment being irreconcilable with an earlier judgment; or - there being no practical benefit to the party in whose favor the U.S. judgment is made in seeking to have that judgment enforced in Ireland, such would be the case where jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules. It may be difficult for a holder of the Notes to effect service of process within the U.S. or to enforce judgments obtained against the Issuer or the Company in U.S. courts. The Company has agreed that it may be served with process with respect to actions based on offers and sales of securities made in the United States and other violations of U.S. securities laws by having Corporation Services Company, a private company, be its U.S. agent appointed for that purpose. Corporation Services Company is located at 19 West 44th Street, Suite 200, New York, NY 10036, United States. A judgment obtained against the Company in a U.S. court would be enforceable in the United States but could be executed upon only to the extent that the Issuer or the Company, as applicable, has assets in the United States. An act that results in the Issuer or the Company, as applicable, or its respective directors or officers being in breach of the civil liability ----- provisions of U.S. law would not, by virtue of the breach of U.S. law, be actionable before a court in Ireland, although such act may potentially give rise to a cause of action under the local laws of Ireland. Pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of November 22, 1996, as amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1100 (the “Blocking Statute”), no judgment of a court or tribunal and no decision of an administrative authority located outside of the European Union giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the laws specified in the annex to the Blocking Statute or to actions based thereon will be recognized or be enforceable in any manner by the courts of the Republic of Ireland.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or our directors you will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where we or the relevant director has assets. As a result, it could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or against these individuals outside of the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the applicable securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws outside of the United States could render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors. While the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the Netherlands, you should consult with your own advisors as needed to enforce a judgment in the Netherlands or elsewhere outside the United States. There is currently no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be automatically recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. Under current practice, however, a Dutch court will generally, subject to compliance with certain procedural requirements, recognize and give effect to the judgment if such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of principles of proper procedure (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) is not contrary to the public policy of The Netherlands, and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgement of a foreign court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in the Netherlands. Dutch courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or other awards. If a Dutch court upholds and regards as conclusive evidence the final judgment of the U.S. court, the Dutch court will generally grant the same judgment without litigating again on the merits. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Based on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities. Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. Such pre-trial discovery process does not exist under Dutch law. In the event directors or other third parties are liable towards a Dutch company, only the company itself can bring a civil action against those parties. The individual shareholders do not have the right to bring an action on behalf of the company. Only in the event that the cause for the liability of a third party to the company also constitutes a tortious act directly against a shareholder, such shareholder has an individual right of action against such third party in its own name. The Dutch Civil Code does provide for the possibility to initiate such actions collectively and a foundation ----- or an association whose objective is to protect the rights of a group of persons having similar interests can institute a collective action.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy; - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Recognition and enforcement of a New York judgment by an Australian court in such an action would not be successful if the rules governing proceedings in the Australian court have not been satisfied, or there are grounds to deny enforcement, such as; - the party in whose favor the judgment is given and the applicant in the proceedings are not identical; ----- - the court giving the judgment lacked the jurisdiction to give the judgment according to Australian private international law principles of jurisdiction as to subject matter and personal jurisdiction over foreign companies; - the judgment was obtained by fraud or duress or in a manner contrary to natural justice or public policy; - the matter determined by the judgment was the subject of an earlier final and conclusive judgment by another court having jurisdiction; - the judgment was contrary to the public policy laws of Australia or the law of public policy of the State of New York; or - the enforcement proceeding was commenced outside any applicable limitation periods and any procedural rules including in relation to jurisdiction and service of process for commencement and maintenance of proceedings before the New York court were not observed. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in Australia or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to insolvency (see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of _Guarantees and Security and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Australia”)._ Whilst an Australian court has the power to award a judgment in foreign currency, it is less clear when it will do so and what rate of exchange of the foreign currency into Australian dollars will apply. If an Australian court gives judgment for the sum payable under a New York judgment, the Australian judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available under Australian law for this purpose.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Gibraltar is a common law jurisdiction and the English common law is in force in Gibraltar (subject to modifications as circumstances require and certain statutory exceptions) pursuant to the English Law (Application) Act 1962. In a common law action, a Gibraltar court generally will not (subject to the following) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the of federal or state court in the United States and may order summary judgment on the basis that there is no defence to the claim. An action at common law is subject to the following requirements, namely that: (i) the federal or state court in the United States had jurisdiction over the original proceeding according to English conflicts of law principles; (ii) the original judgment is for a debt for a definite sum of money; (iii) the original judgment is not for a sum payable in respect of tax, or other charges of a like nature in respect of a fine or other penalty; (iv) the original judgment is final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it (even though an appeal is pending or possible) (v) there has not been a prior judgment by a Gibraltar court between the same parties concerning the same issues; (vi) the common law action is brought within six years of the date of the original judgment; (vii) enforcement or recognition of the original judgment does not contravene public policy; and ----- (viii) the original judgment has not been obtained by fraud or in breach of principles of natural justice. Pursuant to section 17 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1993, if the debtor is involved in litigation in countries abroad, the Gibraltar court, at the request of the other litigating party, may make interim orders, for example but not limited to orders freezing assets of the debtor or for disclosure of documents, as if the case were proceeding in the Gibraltar Court.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,522,ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,522.7,Malta,522.7.1,Service of Process,"_Service of Process in Malta_ In terms of Maltese procedural law, specifically article 187 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the laws of Malta) (the “COCP”), in the case of a body having a distinct legal personality, service on such body shall be effected by an executive officer of the courts by leaving a copy of the act or written pleading: (a) at its registered office, principal office, or place of business or postal address with any of the persons vested with the legal or judicial representation thereof or by any company secretary or by any other person authorized in writing by such body to file judicial acts on its behalf or to make any declaration, sworn reply or sworn pleading, or with an employee of such body; or (b) with any of the persons vested with the legal or judicial representation thereof or by any company secretary or by any other person authorized in writing by such body to file judicial acts on its behalf or to make any declaration, sworn reply or sworn pleading. Service may be effected by leaving such copy at the place of residence or business or place of work or postal address of such person with a member of his family or household or with a person in his service or with his attorney or person authorized to receive their mail. It is not lawful to leave such copy with any person under the age of fourteen years, or with any person who, at the time of the service, has a mental disorder or other condition, which renders him incapable of giving evidence of such service. A person shall be presumed to be able to give such evidence unless the contrary is proved; and no objection may be raised on the ground of irregularity of the service for any of those reasons, if it is shown that the copy has actually reached the person to be served therewith. If service is not effected on a first attempt, the officer charged with the service shall make two other attempts to serve the copy of the pleading without further authorizations by the court and such attempts shall be made at different times of the day with the last attempt at service to be made after judicial hours. Each attempt of service is to be made after the payment of the appropriate fee due to the registry. The officer charged with the service shall file a separate certificate of service for each attempt made in the acts of the proceedings. If it appears from the certificate of the officer charged with the service of a written pleading that service has not been effected as required above, the court may, if it appears that at least one of the persons vested with the legal or judicial representation thereof or any company secretary or any other person authorized in writing by such body to file judicial acts on its behalf or to make any declaration, sworn reply or sworn pleading, is in Malta, direct service to be effected by the posting up of a copy of the written pleading at the place in the town or district in which official acts are usually posted up, where the body has its registered office, principal office, or place of business, and by publishing a summary of such written pleading in the Government Gazette and in one or more daily newspapers as the court may direct and, where possible, by posting up a copy of the pleading on the door of the registered office, principal office, or place of business. The court may also adopt such other measures as it may deem fit to bring the pleading to the notice of any of the persons vested with the legal or judicial representation thereof or any company secretary or any other person authorized in writing by such body to file judicial acts on its behalf or to make any declaration, sworn reply or sworn pleading. ----- Where it appears that all the persons any of the persons vested with the legal or judicial representation thereof or any company secretary or any other person authorized in writing by such body to file judicial acts on its behalf or to make any declaration, sworn reply or sworn pleading, are absent from Malta or there exist no such persons, the court shall appoint a curator in the interest of such body in as provided for in article 929(d) of the COCP. Precautionary and executive warrants may only be served or executed by officers of the courts. Save for this, service may also be effected by officers of the Post Office in such manner and under such rules in conformity with postal regulations as the Minister responsible for justice may order by notice in the Gazette; provided that, applications of appeal, and sworn applications made under the provisions of the Constitution of Malta and the European Convention Act, shall be served by the executive officers of the courts. _Service of Process between EU Member States_ With respect to the service of process from one Member State of the European Union to another Member State, the transmission and service of judicial or extrajudicial acts in civil and commercial matters is regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1393/2007 of November 13, 2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters. The procedure requires that the acts which need to be served are transmitted via the transmitting agency of the state from which the act originates and the receiving agency of the state to which the act is addressed. The designated transmitting agency in Malta is the Attorney General’s office. _Service of Process to a non-EU Member State_ Where an act needs to be served in a country which is not a Member State of the European Union, the provisions of the Hague Service Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters of 5 November 1965 shall be applicable insofar as the states involved are signatories of the Convention. The Hague Service Convention provides for channels of transmission to be used when a judicial or extrajudicial document needs to be transmitted from one State Party to the Convention to another State Party for service in the latter. The Legal Procedures (Ratification of Conventions) Act (Chapter 443 of the Laws of Malta), gives the Hague Service Convention of 1965 force of law in Malta. Judicial or extrajudicial documents which originate in Malta to be transmitted in a Contracting State other than Malta, shall be transmitted: (a) directly by the central authority, in the case of extrajudicial documents; and (b) by the Registrar of Courts, to the central authority, in the case of judicial documents, and, the central authority would have to transmit back the decision to the authority concerned. Where Malta is the State addressed for the purposes of Article 5 of The Hague Convention of 1965, the central authority shall cause the document to be served by attaching the document to a judicial letter filed in the Registry of the Civil Court, First Hall, to be served on the person addressed together with such document, and such judicial letter and accompanying documents shall be served in accordance with the methods prescribed in article 187 of the COCP (provided that the reference to curators appointed by the court in article 187(7) shall not apply and provided that the proviso to article 187(8) shall not apply); as the central authority may deem fit to specify in the circumstances of each case. The Central Authority for Malta is the Office of the State Advocate. Therefore, the service of documents in a country which is not a Member State of the European Union would require the filing, in the Maltese First Hall of the Civil Court, a judicial letter to which the documents to be served are attached.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453
1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,522,ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,522.8,Enforcement of Judgments,522.8.1,,"In the case of judgments falling within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) (the “European Judgments Regulation”), thus involving member states of the European Union, the recognition and enforcement would be subject to the provisions contained in the European Judgments Regulation. ----- The recognition and enforcement of judgments pronounced by any judicial authority of any other state not being the superior courts in the United Kingdom, would be subject to the applicable provisions of the COCP. In line with article 826 of the COCP, saving the provisions of the British Judgments (ReciprocalEnforcement) Act, any judgment delivered by a competent court outside Malta and constituting a _res _judicata (that is, a final judgment from which there could be no appeal), may be enforced by a competent_ court in Malta, in the same manner as judgments delivered in Malta. For the purposes of enforcing any such judgment, an application before the Courts of Malta would need to be filed, containing a demand that the enforcement of such judgment be ordered. Article 827 further provides that enforcement as contemplated above would not take place if the judgment sought to be enforced may be set aside on any of the grounds contemplated under article 811 of the COCP, or in case of a judgment by default of the parties were not contumacious according to foreign law, or if the judgment contains any disposition contrary to public policy or the internal public law of Malta. The grounds contemplated under article 811 of the COCP under which a judgment may be set aside are the following: (a) where the judgment was obtained by fraud on the part of any of the parties to the prejudice of the other party; (b) where the sworn application was not served on the party cast, provided that, notwithstanding such omission, such party shall not have entered an appearance at the trial; (c) where any of the parties to the suit was under legal disability to sue or be sued, provided no plea thereanent had been raised and determined; (d) where the judgment was delivered by a court having no jurisdiction in terms of article 741(a) of the COCP, provided no plea thereanent had been raised and determined; (e) where the judgment contains a wrong application of the law (for the purposes of this paragraph there shall be deemed to be a wrong application of the law only where the decision, assuming the fact to be as established in the judgment which it is sought to set aside, is not in accordance with the law, provided the issue was not in reference to an interpretation of the law expressly dealt with in the judgment; (f) where judgment was given on any matter not included in the demand; (g) where judgment was given in excess of the demand; (h) where the judgment is conflicting with a previous judgment given in a suit on the same subject-matter and between the same parties, and constituting a res judicata, provided no plea of res judicata had been raised and determined; (i) where the judgment contains contradictory dispositions; (j) where the judgment was based on evidence which, in a subsequent judgment, was declared to be false or which was so declared in a previous judgment but the party cast was not aware of such fact; (k) where, after the judgment, some conclusive document was obtained, of which the party producing it had no knowledge, or which, with the means provided by law, he could not have produced, before the judgment; (l) where the judgment was the effect of an error resulting from the proceedings or documents of the cause (for the purposes of this paragraph there shall be deemed to be such error only where the decision is based on the supposition of some fact the truth whereof is incontestably excluded, or on the supposition of the non-existence of some fact the truth whereof is positively established, provided that, in either case, the fact was not a disputed issue determined by the judgment. ----- Therefore, subject to the conditions of article 826 being satisfied, and subject to the exceptions contained in article 827 and any other exceptions that may be applicable from time to time, a judgment awarded by a competent court outside Malta and constituting a res judicata may be enforced in Malta, subject to its recognition as a valid and enforceable judgment accordingly. Once a judgment ordering the enforcement of another judgment delivered by a Court outside Malta is granted, it must be registered in the Public Registry office, and from that day of registration a hypothec is created in regard to the debt judicially acknowledged by the judgment the enforcement of which is ordered. In terms of the British Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act (Chapter 52 of the Laws of Malta) judgments obtained in superior courts in the United Kingdom, may be registered in one of the superior courts of Malta following an application filed by the judgment creditor, at any time within twelve (12) months after the date of the judgment, or such longer period as may be allowed, and, on any such application, the court may, if in all circumstances of the case it thinks it is just and convenient that the judgment should be enforced in Malta, and subject to the provisions of the British Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, order the judgment to be registered accordingly. Once a judgment is registered in terms of the British Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, the judgment shall from the date of registration be of the same force and effect, and executive proceedings may be taken thereon, as if it had been a judgment originally obtained on the date of registration in the registering court and its registration in the Public Registry Office may be made in accordance with Maltese law. Notwithstanding the above, no assurance or guarantee of any sort may be given as to whether a foreign judgment will in effect be recognized or enforceable in Malta. The above is also subject to any treaties which the Government of Malta may enter into in the future. _Arbitration awards_ Arbitration law in Malta follows the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, and the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which are reproduced in the Arbitration Act (Chapter 387 of the Laws of Malta). The Arbitration Act also reproduces the Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses 1923, the Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1927 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, 1965 (the “Washington Convention”). Arbitral awards granted in Malta can therefore be enforced in other jurisdictions that are party to these international arbitration treaties. Arbitral awards given locally, once registered with the Malta Arbitration Centre, would constitute an executive title, and may be enforced in the same way as a judgment awarded by the Courts of Malta would be enforced. Any foreign arbitration award obtained from a foreign arbitration may be enforced in Malta as if it were awarded locally, once it is registered with the Malta Arbitration Centre and becomes an executive title, and this so long as any of the treaties set out in the Second Schedule to the Arbitration Act applies to the award, and therefore the arbitration body pronouncing the award is recognized by the Government of Malta. Similarly, arbitral awards given under the Washington Convention are recognised and enforced in Malta as if they were final judgments awarded before the Courts in Malta. For the purposes of enforcement of an arbitral award or judgment constituting an executive title, an application would need to be filed before the national courts in Malta for the purposes of enforcement through the issuance of executive warrants, which would vary depending on the manner in which enforcement is being sought.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

Presently, the reciprocating countries and their superior courts include the following: (i) High Court of Justice, Court of Appeal, or the Supreme Court of England and Wales; (ii) Scotland Court of Session, Sheriff Court; (iii) Northern Ireland Supreme Court of Judicature; (iv) Jersey Royal Court, Court of Appeal; and (v) Guernsey Royal Court, Court of Appeal. Not all judgments given by such superior courts can be registered. The registration procedure set out in the 1968 Act applies only to judgments or orders given or made in civil proceedings, or in criminal proceedings for the payment of a sum of money in respect of compensation or damages to an injured party. In addition, the judgment must: (i) be final and conclusive as between the parties (whether or not an appeal in the foreign court is pending or possible); (ii) provide for the payment of a sum of money, but not in respect of taxes or similar charges, or a fine or other penalty; (iii) be for a moneys sum which has not been wholly satisfied; and (iv) be able to be enforced by execution. Further detailed provisions in relation to the enforcement of foreign judgments in the Isle of Man are contained in the 1968 Act. If a foreign judgment falls within the 1968 Act, the judgment creditor must use the registration procedure, as further described in the 1968 Act. Under Isle of Man common law, a foreign judgment in personam given by the court of a foreign country (such as the United States) not covered by the 1968 Act with jurisdiction to give that judgment may be recognized and enforced in the Isle of Man courts by an action for the amount due under it provided that the judgment: (i) is for a debt or definite sum of money (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty); (ii) is final and conclusive; (iii) was not obtained by fraud; (iv) is not one whose enforcement would be contrary to public policy in the Isle of Man; and (v) was not obtained in proceedings which were opposed to natural justice in the Isle of Man. Where registration of a foreign judgment under the 1968 Act is not available, and the foreign judgment is not otherwise enforceable by an action based on the foreign judgment, it will be necessary for a holder of a foreign judgment to commence fresh proceedings in the Isle of Man, which proceedings might, inter alia, involve a re-examination of the merits of the case. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. _Basis for Opinion_ These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. _Critical Audit Matters_ The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. _Valuation of FOX’s option to acquire stake in FanDuel_ As discussed in Note 20, Flutter has an agreement with the FOX Corporation (FOX) that provides FOX with an option (the Fox Option) to acquire an 18.6% equity interest in FanDuel Group LLC, Flutter’s US subsidiary. As the Company is the writer of this option, the settlement obligation is recorded as a liability on its balance sheet and adjusted to fair value through the Statement of Comprehensive Income/(Loss). We identified the assessment of the valuation of the Fox Option as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required in evaluating certain key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option, specifically, the discounts applied for lack of control and marketability, licensing probability, volatility rates and enterprise value of FanDuel. Changes to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the valuation. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the Company’s licensing probability assumption by comparing the assumption to contractual and regulatory requirements and available industry data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge who assisted in: - evaluating the discounts applied for lack of control and marketability by comparing against comparable market data; and - evaluating the volatility rates and enterprise value of FanDuel using market comparables and other publicly available market data. ----- _Assessment of the fair value of PokerStars trademark intangible asset_ As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has $5,881 million of intangible assets, net, as of December 31, 2023. As discussed in Note 2, finite lived intangible assets including capitalized software are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined that a triggering event occurred and the carrying value of the PokerStars trademark intangible asset within the International segment exceeded its fair value, resulting in an intangible asset impairment charge of $725 million. We identified the assessment of the fair value of the PokerStars trademark intangible asset within the International segment as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor subjectivity is involved in evaluating the discount rate and royalty rate assumptions used in the impairment assessment. Changes to these assumptions could have a substantial impact on the fair value of the PokerStars trademark intangible asset and the amount of the impairment charge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: - evaluating the discount rates, by comparing them against ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities; and - evaluating the royalty rate using market comparables and past valuation analyses of the PokerStars brand. /s/ KPMG We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2349,FLUTTER ENTERTAINMENT PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.** **ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS,2349.6,Fair Value Measurements — Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance,2349.6.1,,"Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three- tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows: _Level 1 — Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date; Level 2 — Inputs are observable, (other than Level 1 quoted prices) unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets_ or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and _Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data for the related assets or liabilities._ The categorization of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily 1) assets and liabilities acquired in connection with business combinations, 2) long lived assets, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, which are remeasured when the fair value is below carrying value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these assets, the Group does not periodically adjust carrying value to fair value, except in the event of impairment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2349,FLUTTER ENTERTAINMENT PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.** **ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS,2349.19,"Income Tax Expense — The Group accounts for income tax expense under the asset and liability method, which requires the",2349.19.1,,"recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in the income tax rates on deferred tax asset and liability balances is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such rate change. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Group accounts for uncertainty in income tax expense in its consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likelythan-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The income tax expense includes the effects of any unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

1145_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2349,FLUTTER ENTERTAINMENT PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.** **ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS,2349.21,"Revenue Recognition — The Group, in accordance with ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, recognizes",2349.21.1,,"revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of promised goods or services to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Group expects to be entitled for those goods or services using a five-step process. ## F-13 ----- The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: - Identify the contract, or contracts, with the customer; - Identify the performance obligations in the contract; - Determine the transaction price; - Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised good or services. The Group is engaged in the business of digital sports entertainment and gaming, earning its revenue predominantly from two types of gaming products: peer-to-business (“P2B”) and peer-to-peer (“P2P”). The Group’s P2B products involve players playing against the Group and P2P products involve players playing/betting against each other and not against the Group, and the Group makes a commission on the games. The P2B products include a range of games of chance such as sportsbook, online casino, bingo and machine gaming terminals. The P2P products include betting and exchanges, such as Betfair Exchange, horseracing TVG, daily fantasy sports (“DFS”), pari-mutuel wagering and poker. The Group’s main revenue streams are as below: _Sportsbook_ Sportsbook involves the player placing a bet (wager) on various types of sporting events at fixed odds determined by the Group. Bets are made in advance of the sporting event that will determine the outcome of the wager. The player places their bet in the custody of the Group until the event occurs and the result of the sporting event is determined, which will be at some time in the future. The Group has an obligation to honor the outcome of the sporting event and to pay out an amount equal to the stated odds assigned at the time of the bet if the player wins. These elements to the Group’s obligation (honoring the outcome and paying out an amount) are not separable and are considered one performance obligation by the Group. For a single wager, revenue represents the net win or loss from a sporting event, net of new player incentives and player retention incentives. Odds are set based on statistical probabilities such that the Group expects to realize a net win from the aggregation of all individual bets with players over time. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied which corresponds to the occurrence of the sporting event to which the betting relates, at which time recognition of the net win or net loss is recorded. _iGaming (including iGaming, Poker, and Lottery)_ iGaming consists of a full suite of casino and online games such as roulette, blackjack, slot games, bingo, rummy and other card games. Casino games involve players placing wagers to play an online game against the Group. Games are designed to function and determine the outcome of the bet without the intervention of the Group and with only the player making decisions around their bet and the options given in the game. The Group generates revenue through the gross bets placed less payouts on winning bets, which is also referred to as “hold.” The Group has an obligation to honor the outcome of the game and to pay out an amount equal to the stated odds if the player wins the game. These elements to the Group’s obligation (honoring the outcome and paying out an amount) are not separable and are considered one performance obligation by the Group. For a single wager, revenue represents the net win or loss from a game, net of new player incentives and player retention incentives. Individual online games are designed and function in such a manner that the Group expects to realize a net win from the aggregation of all the individual gaming transactions with a player over the relationship based on statistical probabilities. The Group’s performance obligations are satisfied upon the outcome of the game within a few minutes of the placement of the bet by the player at which time net win or net loss is determined and revenue is recognized at that time. _Poker_ Online poker is a peer-to-peer game offered through multiple platforms within the Group where individuals engage in game play against other individuals, not against the Group. Players play against each other in either ring games (i.e., games for cash on a hand-by-hand basis) or in tournaments (i.e., players play against each other for tournament chips with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors) or variations thereof. The Group collects a percentage of a game’s wagers, known as the rake, up to a capped amount in ring games and a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments and sit and go tournaments. ## F-14 ----- The Group’s performance obligation is to operate the ring games and tournaments in accordance with the rules, tabulate the results and pay out players based on the ring games’ and tournaments’ results. These elements to the Group’s obligation are not separable and are considered one performance obligation by the Group. For ring games, revenue (the rake) is recognized at the conclusion of each poker hand. For tournaments, revenue from entry fees revenue is recognized when the tournament has concluded. The Group operates a tiered loyalty program named PokerStars Rewards. Players earn a fixed amount of rewards points for every one currency unit in entry fees for scheduled tournaments and rake. Chests are awarded for a fixed number of rewards points with the number of rewards points required for a chest varying based on tiers. Chests expire after 30 days if unopened. Players in the higher tiers are also entitled to participate in monthly poker challenges with the points targets and rewards personalized based on the players playing history in the form of star coins. Star coins can be exchanged by players for cash, bonuses or other rewards. Star coins expire if a play does not earn any reward points within a six-month rolling period. Pokerstars Rewards provides players with a material right that they would not receive without entering in game play against other individuals on the PokerStars platform and is treated by the Group as a performance obligation. The reward points are initially recognized as a contract liability with the Group allocating a portion of the rake and entry fee based on the relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized when the player exchanges the star coins for cash, bonuses, or other rewards. Revenue from star coins that are not expected to be redeemed is recognized in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by players. _Lottery_ The Group is the lottery operator in Italy, Turkey and Morocco and has a wide-ranging portfolio of draw-based (National Totalizer Numeric Gaming (“NTNG”)) products and instant lottery games that are distributed through affiliated sales points which consists of third-party sales points (coffee shops, tobacco shops, newsstands) and online, through the Group’s websites and apps and other online resellers authorized by the official regulatory bodies in these three markets. The Group’s obligation for NTNG products includes designing new games, managing the operation and infrastructure of NTNG products, developing the distribution network and marketing support for NTNG products, acting as the national totalizator, and providing services for players and winners. These elements to the Group’s obligation of operating a draw-based lottery are not separable and are considered one performance obligation composed of a series of distinct services (i.e., days of service) that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the relevant local gaming authority, the Group’s customer. The Group satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time because the local gaming authority simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the Group performs the services. As consideration for operating the NTNG products on the local gaming authority’s behalf, the Group earns a fixed percentage of the draw-based lottery ticket sales made through its distribution network. Where NTNG products are distributed through the Group’s websites and apps, the Group also earns a reseller commission. Reseller commission is recognized when the sale is concluded through the Group’s websites and apps. The Group also earns a facility fee from affiliated sales points. This is a fee for a portfolio of different services which includes marketing services and technical support. Revenue from facility fee is recognized over the facility service contract period. The Group’s obligation for instant lottery games includes designing, printing and selling instant lottery products and providing the comprehensive services necessary to operate integrated instant product operations including: (i) instant products planning, monitoring and management systems functions, (ii) warehousing, inventory management and distribution functions, and (iii) marketing and game support functions. These elements to the Group’s obligation of operating instant lottery games are not separable and are considered one performance obligation composed of a series of distinct services (i.e., days of service) that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the relevant local gaming authority, the Group’s customer. The Group satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time because the local gaming authority simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the Group performs the services. As consideration for operating the instant lottery products on behalf of the local gaming authority, the Group earns a pre-determined percentage of the lottery ticket sales. _Other Revenue (including Exchange betting, Pari-mutuel wagering and Other) Exchange betting_ The Group’s betting exchange offers a platform for players to bet on the outcome of discrete sporting events. The platform offers players the opportunity to ‘back’ (bets than an outcome will occur) and ‘lay’ (bets that the outcome will not occur) with players betting against each other and not against the Group. The platform supports ‘in play’ betting (betting that takes place ## F-15 ----- after an event has started and up to its conclusion) and ‘cash out’ which is a way for players to lock in a profit, or cut your losses, without having to wait for the event to finish. The Group earns a commission on the players winnings, net of discount which vary based on a players betting activity. The Group’s performance obligation is to provide access to the platform, facilitate the placement of wagers including getting players matched at the best available odds through its exchange platform, and settle the wagers based on the results of the event to which the betting relates. These elements to the Group’s obligation are not separable and are considered one performance obligation by the Group. As such, revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied which corresponds to the occurrence of the event to which the betting relates, at which time recognition of the commission is recorded. _Pari-mutuel wagering_ Pari-mutuel wagers on horse and greyhound races are accepted through the Group’s wagering systems. Wagers placed through the wagering systems are sent into commingled pools at the host racetrack and are subject to all host racetrack rules and restrictions. The Group receives a fee for the wagers it has brought to the pool and does not collect anything else when a bettor loses, nor does it pay additional amounts (from its funds) when a bettor wins. The Group is an agent in these transactions and records revenue on a net basis as it is merely offering access to the pool and simulcasting the event (the performance obligation). Revenue represents a percentage of amount of the wager (“handle”) from pari-mutuel wagers on horse and greyhound races. The percentage fee earned by the Group depends on the racetrack, type of wager accepted and the associated state regulations. Revenue is recognized only at the conclusion of the race, at which point all bettors are paid through the Group from the pool of funds based on closing odds of the applicable race. Revenue is stated net of new player incentives and player retention incentives. _Other_ The Group’s Daily Fantasy Sports is a platform offering fantasy sports contests and fantasy sports tournaments which enables players to use their skill and knowledge of relevant professional sports information and the fantasy sports rules to compete against one another for prizes announced in advance of the event. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the contest ends or when each round is completed over the period of the tournament. The Group sponsors certain live poker tours and events, uses its industry expertise to provide consultancy and support services to the casinos that operate the events, and has marketing arrangements for branded poker rooms at various locations around the world. The Group also provides customers with other media and advertising services, and limited content development services with revenue generated by way of affiliate commissions, revenue share arrangements and advertising income as applicable. Revenue is recognized upon satisfying the applicable performance obligations, at a point in time or over time as applicable. Revenue from sponsorships represents advertising campaigns for customers who become a presenting sponsor at events, which is recognized over the period of the sponsored event. Interest revenue is earned player deposits is accrued on a monthly basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. While this is not revenue earned from contracts with players, interest revenue on player deposits is presented in revenue since it is earned on funds that are held as part of the Group’s revenue generating activities. _Contract balances_ Contract assets and liabilities represent the differences in the timing of revenue recognition from the receipt of cash from the players. The Group’s contract assets balance is highly immaterial as the players are mostly required to pay in advance of the Group satisfying its performance obligation. Contract liabilities arise because of open sports betting positions, undrawn and unclaimed lottery prizes, and deferred revenue relating to loyalty points.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

On September 22, 2021, the Group announced that the legal dispute between Flutter and the Commonwealth of Kentucky had been settled in full. The Group agreed to pay a further $200 million to Kentucky in addition to the $100 million previously forfeited to the Commonwealth as part of the supersedeas bond in the case in line with the provision outstanding at December 31, 2020. In return, Kentucky released Stars Interactive Holdings (IOM) Ltd, Rational Entertainment Enterprises Ltd and, inter alia, all Flutter entities from any claims relating to the matters in issue in the Kentucky proceedings, and the proceedings were consequently dismissed with prejudice. As a result of this settlement, costs of $223 million (including associated legal costs of $23 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. 3 Fees primarily associated with (i) transaction fees related to the proposed listing of Flutter’s ordinary shares in the U.S. of $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2023; (ii) Fox Option arbitration proceedings of $30 million and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with tombola and Sisal of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2022; and (iv) advisory fees related to the potential listing of a minority stake of FanDuel in the U.S., which was announced in May 2021, of $13 million, Fox Option arbitration proceedings of $8 million, and acquisition-related costs in connection with Junglee Games, Singular, Sisal and tombola for fiscal 2021 of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 4 During the year ended December 31, 2023 costs of $126 million (year ended December 31, 2022: $155 million) primarily relate to various restructuring and other strategic initiatives to drive increased synergies arising primarily from the acquisitions of TSG and Sisal.

The U.S. division consists of the following brands: FanDuel, TVG and PokerStars (U.S.). As of the end of fiscal 2023, FanDuel online sportsbook was available in 20 states, FanDuel online casino was available in 5 states, FanDuel paid DFS offering was available in 44 states, FanDuel or TVG online horseracing product was available in 32 states, FanDuel free-to-play products were available in all 50 states and our PokerStars (U.S.) iGaming product was available in 3 states.

International The International segment includes operations in over 100 global markets and offers sports betting, casino, poker, rummy and lottery, mainly online. Sisal, the leading iGaming operator in Italy, is the largest brand in the International division following its acquisition in August 2022. The International division also includes PokerStars, Betfair International, Adjarabet and Junglee Games. The Group continues to diversify internationally and is taking its online offering into regulated markets with a strong gambling culture and a competitive tax framework under which the Group has the ability to offer a broad betting and iGaming product range. The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the Adjusted EBITDA of each operating segment. Adjusted EBITDA of each segment is defined as net loss before income tax expense, other income (expense) net, interest income (expense) net, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets, loss/gain on disposal of business, acquisition costs, restructuring and integration costs, legal settlements/(loss contingencies), gaming taxes expenses and corporate overheads that principally apply to the Group as a whole. The Group manages its assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment.

A valuation allowance has been recorded against deferred tax assets relating to $1,067 million (December 31, 2022: $1,069 million). This is on the basis that there is insufficient certainty of there being future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions and therefore the assets will not be realizable. The timing of recognition is a key area of judgement in the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group has written off deferred tax assets of $79 million relating to net operating losses. A full valuation allowance was previously recorded in relation to these net operating losses and therefore there is no net effect of this within the income tax expenses for the year.

The impairment was primarily driven by an assessment of strategy and operational model aimed at maximizing the value of PokerStars’ proprietary poker assets consistent with our International segment strategy to combine global scale with local presence. A decision was made in December 2023 to move away from the existing capital intensive PokerStars technology in order to improve efficiency and performance of the business by leveraging technology and marketing resources across the Group, thereby unlocking synergies with other Flutter brands. This decision resulted in a change in the grouping of PokerStars’ acquired intangible assets, with the PokerStars trademark not allocated to any distinct asset groups identified as it is able to generate identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities under the new strategy and operational model. In measuring the impairment loss which reflected the impact of lower project royalty revenue, the Group utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value. Assumptions inherent in estimating the fair value include revenue forecast, royalty rate of 5.0%, income tax rate of 12.5%, and discount rate of 12.5%. The Group selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts of cash flows specific to the remaining useful life of the trademark using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates. Financial forecasts beyond the period covered by the plans were estimated by extrapolating the forecasts based on the plans using a steady growth in line with the long-term average growth for the countries in which the trademark is used. As the fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market, they represented Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Group revised the estimated useful lives of certain development expenditure intangible assets. This change in estimate was applied prospectively, which resulted in an additional amortization expense of $30 million that was recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) and resulted in a decrease in net income of $26 million, or $0.15 per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in estimate does not have a material impact on future reporting periods. ## F-27 ----- Total amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows: ($ in millions)_ **2023** **2022** **2021 Cost of sales ........................................................................................................ $ 373 $ 298 $ 231 Technology, research and development expenses .............................................. 54 27 54 Sales and marketing expenses ............................................................................. 643 630 621 General and administrative expenses .................................................................. 74 13 18",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The book value approximated to the fair value on the remaining assets as all amounts are expected to be received. The fair value of trademarks identified was $529 million and was estimated using the Relief from Royalty Method. Significant assumptions include: (i) Royalty rates of 5.1% and 7.6% applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the trade name to estimate the royalty savings and (ii) a discount rate of 8.8% and 14.9%. Trademarks are amortized over their expected weighted-average useful economic life of 20 years. The fair value of customer relationships identified was $278 million and was estimated using the Multi- Period Excess Earnings Method. Significant assumptions include: (i) expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, (ii) customer attrition rates, which assume a substantial customer churn within the first five years, less a contributory assets charge of 13.9% and 12.5%, and (iii) discount rates of 11.0% and 14.9%. Customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated method over their expected weighted-average useful economic life of 4.1 years. The fair value of licenses (lottery, gaming and betting concessions) identified was $223 million and was estimated using the Replacement Cost Method. Significant assumptions include details regarding both the useful life and estimates of current cost with renewing the existing concessions. The fair value of developed technology was $130 million and was estimated using the Relief from Royalty Method. Significant assumptions include: (i) Royalty rates of 10.1% applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings and (ii) a discount rate of 11.0% and 14.9%. Technology is amortized over their expected weighted-average useful economic life of 5 years. The fair value of point of sales and affiliate network was $126 million and was estimated using the Replacement Cost Method for the point of sales network and the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method for the affiliation network. Significant assumptions include (i) estimates of current cost with setting up the existing point of sales network and (ii) estimated revenues and cash flows derived from the affiliation network which assumes an attrition rate of 10%. The resulting cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of 8.8% to arrive at the fair value for the affiliation network. Point of sales network are amortized over their expected weighted-average useful economic life of 20 years and 15 years for affiliation network. Acquisition-related costs of $7 million were included in general and administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income / (loss) for the year ending December 31, 2022 (2021: $3 million). The gross contractual amount for trade receivables and other receivables due is $47 million, with a loss allowance of $8 million recognized on acquisition. The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill (none of which is deductible for tax purposes) is the opportunity to increase the Group’s exposure to an attractive fast-growing regulated online market with Sisal’s omni-channel offering delivering a competitive advantage to the Group. The acquisition provides the Group with lottery capabilities for the first time and presents the opportunity to grow outside of Italy as Sisal have already done in Turkey via this product offering. There are also tangible opportunities to deliver material revenue synergies from the acquisition of Sisal through (i) leveraging Sisal’s retail channel to grow online deposits for existing Flutter brands, (ii) enhancing Sisal’s sports betting offering by utilizing the Group’s pricing and risk management capabilities and (iii) enhancing Sisal’s casino product by providing it with access to the Group’s in-house gaming content. The goodwill has been allocated to the existing International segment and reporting unit. The fair value of the non-controlling interest in Sisal Sans, a private entity, was estimated by applying the income approach and a market approach. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described in Section 820-10-35. Assumptions include a discount rate of 14.9% and terminal growth rate of 5.0%. As at December 31, 2022, the acquisition accounting for this acquisition was provisional. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the group finalized the acquisition accounting for Sisal. The adjustments arose as a result of new accounting information obtained relating to conditions that existed at the acquisition date primarily related to provisions and fair value finalization of property, plant and equipment acquired which increased the net assets acquired by $34 million and reduced the goodwill by $34 million. Since the date of acquisition to December 31, 2022, Sisal contributed revenue of $465 million and $28 million of profit after tax to the results of the Group. ## F-29 ----- _Acquisition of tombola_ On January 10, 2022, the Group completed the acquisition of a 100% stake in tombola, the UK market’s leading online bingo operator. tombola is a successful bingo-led gaming Group with an emphasis on providing a low staking bingo proposition to a highly engaged customer base.

The book value equated to the fair value on the remaining assets as all amounts are expected to be received. The fair value of customer relationships identified was $163 million and was estimated using the Multi- Period Excess Earnings Method. Significant assumptions include: (i) revenue attributable to customers, EBIT margin and contribution to assets charges, and (ii) a discount rate of 10.9%. Customer relationships are being amortized over their expected weighted-average useful economic life of 5.1 years. The fair value of the trademarks identified was $122 million and was estimated using the Relief from Royalty Method. Significant assumptions include: (i) the estimated annual revenue and the royalty rate, and (ii) a discount rate of 11.1%. Trademarks are amortized over their expected weighted-average useful economic life of 20 years. The fair value of developed technology was $48 million and was estimated using the Relief from Royalty Method. Significant assumptions include: (i) the estimated revenue, technology migration and the royalty rate, and (ii) a discount rate of 10.1%. Technology is being amortized over their expected weighted-average useful economic life of 5 years. Acquisition-related costs of $4 million were included in general and administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income / (loss) for the year ending December 31, 2022 (2021: $3 million). The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill (none of which is deductible for tax purposes) are the expansion of the Group’s position in online bingo and the sharing of product capabilities, expertise and technology across the UKI division. The goodwill has been allocated to the existing UKI reporting unit. Since the date of acquisition to December 31, 2022, tombola contributed revenue of $217 million and $12 million profit after tax to the results of the Group. _Unaudited pro forma information_ The pro forma financial information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the acquisitions had been completed on the date indicated, does not reflect synergies that might have been achieved, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position.

The fair value of the consideration was $7 million based on the fair value of Junglee at the date of the acquisition. The purpose of the acquisition is to combine it with the Group’s existing Indian business and widen and expand its product offering in the fast-growing Indian market. Due to the immaterial size of the transaction, no further disclosures are provided. As part of the acquisition of Sachiko, the Group has put in place arrangements, consisting of call and put options, that could result in it acquiring the 5% of Junglee held by the former shareholders of Sachiko in 2027 and 2032 based on the future Revenue and EBITDA performance of Junglee. _Year ended December 31, 2021 Acquisition of Junglee and Singular_ The Group acquired 57.3% in Junglee Games (“Junglee”) and 100% in Singular during the year ended December 31, 2021. The total consideration was $119 million, which consisted of a cash payment of $95 million and contingent consideration of $24 million in the case of Singular that is payable subject to the acquired business meeting strategic milestones in the future. Intangible assets of $65 million were recognized. Goodwill of $90 million was recognized and allocated to the International operating segment and reporting unit. The net assets acquired amounted to $62 million, of which cash and cash equivalents amounted to $25 million with the fair value of non-controlling interest in Junglee amounting to $34 million. Since the date of acquisition to December 31, 2021, these acquisitions contributed $69 million of revenue and $10 million of a net loss after tax to the results of the consolidated Group. If the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2021, their contribution to revenue and net loss after tax for the year ended December 31, 2021 would have been $73 million and $8 million, respectively. Acquisition-related costs of $2 million for these acquisitions were included in general and administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) for the year ending December 31, 2021. _Disposal of Oddschecker Global Media_ On August 31, 2021 the Group sold all of the shares of Oddschecker Global Media (“OGM”), a fully owned subsidiary of the Group, to Bruin Capital, in exchange for $175 million in cash (proceeds of $194 million net of $19 million cash already on the balance sheet) and recorded a gain on the disposal of $17 million. There is potential for the Group to receive further consideration of up to $28 million pending future events. However, it is currently not probable that further amounts will be received and therefore no contingent asset has been recorded. Prior to the sale, the non-current assets were measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. No impairments were recognized. The assets and liabilities of OGM were included within the UKI segment up to the date of sale. ## F-31 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

In December 2021, the Group amended and restated the Term Loan A Agreement under which all of the lenders consented to an upsize of £100 million ($135 million) across the GBP First Lien Term Loan A and the GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 resulting in aggregate total commitments of £1.5 billion ($2 billion) consisting of GBP First Lien Term Loan A commitments of £1.02 billion ($1.4 billion) and a GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 commitment of £0.5 billion ($0.6 billion). In September 2022, as part of the refinancing of the incremental Term Loan B Facility of €2.0 billion ($2.0 billion) incurred to fund the acquisition of Sisal (as discussed below), the Group further amended and restated the Term Loan A Agreement under which the lenders named therein (including new lenders) agreed to an upsize of £267 million ($297 million) to the GBP Revolving Credit Facility (total revolving credit facility of £749 million ($834 million)) and a EUR First Lien Term Loan A of €549 million ($538 million) and a USD First Lien Term Loan A 2026 of $200 million. The Group incurred issuance costs amounting $3 million in connection with the EUR First Lien Term Loan A and USD First Lien Term Loan A which has been reduced from the debt’s initial net carrying amount and amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the debt. The Group also incurred $4.5 million in connection with the upsize to the GBP Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2023, as part of a wider refinancing, we entered into the TLA/TLB/RCF Agreement (as defined below). The proceeds from the TLA/TLB/RCF Agreement were used to refinance the entire Term Loan A Agreement comprising of GBP First Lien Term Loan A 2025 of £1,018 million ($1,292 million), which would have matured in May 2025, EUR First Lien Term Loan A 2026 of €549 million ($602 million), which would have matured in July 2026, and USD First Lien Term Loan A 2026 of $200 million, which would have matured in July 2026. ## F-34 ----- The GBP First Lien Term Loan A 2025 had an interest rate of Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”) plus a Credit Adjustment Spread (“CAS”) plus a margin of 1.75% with a SONIA floor of 0%.

The GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 could be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issuance of letters of credit and/or the establishment of ancillary facilities with lenders on a bilateral basis. Each cash advance under the GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 was to be repaid at the end of its interest period or in full on the maturity date being May 2025. Amounts repaid could be re-borrowed (with automatic netting in the case of any rollover of all or any part of a cash advance and in each case subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025). A commitment fee of 35% of the margin then applicable on the available undrawn commitment was payable quarterly in arrears during the availability period, or on the last day of the availability period, which was one month prior to the maturity date. A utilization fee was also payable in the range of 0.10% to 0.40% per annum based on the proportion of revolving credit facility loans to the total GBP Revolving Credit Facility 2025 commitments. The utilization fee accrues from day to day and was payable in arrears on the last day of each successive period of three months that ends during the availability period. As of December 31, 2023, there is no debt outstanding under the Term Loan A Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Group had drawn down £63 million ($75 million). The Group had an undrawn revolving credit commitment of £686 million ($830 million) as of December 31, 2022, of which £11 million ($13 million) was reserved for issuing guarantees.

All of the facilities under the Term Loan A Agreement and the Term Loan B Agreement were secured by the same collateral. The Term Loan A Agreement required the Group to ensure that the ratio of consolidated net borrowings to consolidated EBITDA as defined therein (the net total leverage ratio) is not greater than 5.10:1 on a bi-annual basis. As of December 31, 2023, the Group was in compliance with the covenant.

In June 2020, the Group amended and restated the Term Loan B Agreement under which, among others, all the covenants and restrictions therein bind the combined Flutter and TSG allowing it to operate and integrate as such and the reporting obligations under the Term Loan B Agreement are synchronized with reporting of the consolidated financial results of the Group to other of the Group’s stakeholders. In July 2021, the Group entered into a second amendment to the Term Loan B Agreement under which the Group refinanced all existing term loans then outstanding under the Term Loan B Agreement to Dollar Term B Loans with an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, Euro Term B Loans with an aggregate principal amount of €507 million ($598 million) and a new incremental Term B Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion (together the “2021 Term Loans”).

In July 2022, the Group entered into the third amendment to the Term Loan B Agreement under which the Group obtained an incremental term loan of €2.0 billion ($2.0 billion) to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Sisal. In September 2022, the Group refinanced the incremental term loan of €2.0 billion ($2.0 billion) by incurring new incremental term loans of $1.2 billion and the EUR First Lien Term Loan A and the USD First Lien Term Loan A as discussed above. In November 2023, as part of a wider refinancing, the Group entered into the TLA/TLB/RCF Agreement as discussed below. The proceeds from the TLA/TLB/RCF Agreement (as defined below) were used to refinance the entire USD First Lien Term ## F-35 ----- Loan B 2026 (being the repayment of the outstanding principal of $2,880 million). As part of this transaction, $720 million of the principal of the USD First Lien Term Loan B 2028 was also refinanced.

If the warrants remain unexercised at the end of exercise period, they automatically convert into such number of Investor Units that provide Boyd an additional ownership of 0.5% envisaged on exercise of such warrants. The Group agreed a redemption mechanism with Boyd in the form of symmetrical call and put options as part of Boyd’s acquisition of ownership interest in FanDuel in 2019. The collaboration anniversary options are exercisable beginning August 1, 2028, and continuing for a period of 30 days (the “Collaboration Anniversary Exercise Period”) and expire if neither the Group nor Boyd exercise the options. The collaboration termination options are exercisable beginning on the earlier to occur of the termination and expiration of the collaboration agreement and continuing for a period of 30 days (the “Collaboration Termination Exercise Period”) and expire if neither the Group nor Boyd exercise the options. The symmetrical call and put options enable the Group to acquire Boyd’s 5% non-controlling ownership at an exercise price negotiated in good faith between them, as two unrelated, independent parties. If FanDuel and Boyd are unable to agree on an exercise price, independent appraisers are required to perform a fair market valuation exercise of Boyd’s Investor Units, without giving effect to any ‘minority discount’ or ‘liquidity discount.’ The aforesaid symmetrical call and put options can be settled, at the Group’s election, in cash denominated in U.S. dollars, freely tradeable shares of Flutter listed on the Irish Stock Exchange plc or the London Stock Exchange plc or any combination thereof. Subsequent to Flutter’s listing on NYSE in January 2024, Flutter is delisted from Irish Stock Exchange and the options can also be settled in freely tradeable shares of Flutter listed on NYSE.

As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $152 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the Restricted Share Plan, which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 1.60 years. 249,095 of the 2023 options awarded, have a market condition based on the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the FTSE 100 (excluding housebuilders, real estate investment trusts and natural resources companies). This market condition was directly factored into the fair-value-based measure of the award at the grant date. The Group engaged a third-party valuation specialist to provide a fair value for the awards using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The key inputs in the model were the expected weighted-average volatility of 34.45% and the weighted-average share price of the Group at the date of grant of the award of $172.08. The weighted-average fair value of the awards at the grant date was $144.00. _Flutter Entertainment plc 2023 Long Term Incentive Plan (“2023 LTIP”) In April 2023, the Group adopted the Flutter_ Entertainment plc 2023 Long Term Incentive Plans which enables the Group to grant share awards and nil cost options with a single award vesting in tranches (if the relevant performance conditions are met) after the end of the performance period applicable to the tranche. Awards granted under the 2023 LTIP shall have a performance period of not less than three years. The awards granted under the 2023 LTIP have a market condition based on the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) relative to the FTSE 100 (excluding real estate investment trusts and closed end investment trusts). This market condition was directly factored into the fair-value-based measure of the award. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group granted 44,820 share options with a nominal exercise price under the 2023 LTIP. The Group engaged a third-party valuation specialist to provide a fair value for the awards using a Monte Carlo ## F-44 ----- simulation model. The key inputs in the model were the expected weighted-average volatility of 35.91% and the share price of the Group at the date of grant of the award of $200.00. The weighted-average fair value of the awards at the grant date was $112.03. For year ended December 31, 2023 the total compensation cost arising from the 2023 LTIP was $1 million. As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $4 million of total unrecognized compensation costs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.33 years. The performance targets associated with a further 134,460 share options had not been determined as of December 31, 2023 and as a result no grant date has been established under ASC 718 and no compensation cost recognized in the period. _FanDuel Group Value Creation Plan and TSE Holdings Ltd FanDuel Group Value Creation Option Plan (together, the “VCP”)_ In 2018, the Group introduced a plan for the employees of FanDuel Group Parent LLC and its subsidiaries (FanDuel Group Parent LLC and its subsidiaries together “FanDuel”) that allowed them to share in the future value created within FanDuel. Employees were to be awarded an allocation of units that represented a share in value created. The value of these units was to be determined by the value of the business in July 2021 and July 2023 compared to benchmark. Employees had the option to exercise 50% of these units at July 2021 at the prevailing value, or roll some or all of them to July 2023 at the prevailing value at that date. The Group had the option of settling this plan via the issuance of Flutter Entertainment plc shares or cash. The Group’s acquisition of an additional 37.2% of FanDuel shares on December 30, 2020 implied a 100% value of FanDuel of $11.2 billion, which was significantly in excess of the out-performance growth cap. Due to this, in May 2021 it was decided to fix the total value of the VCP units at $457 million and determine a value per unit that would be paid out on July 2021 and July 2023 effectively fixing the price per VCP unit value of the plan in both July 2021 and July 2023 to provide certainty to employees. The value per unit to be paid out on VCP units granted in 2018 was set at $318.00 per unit and the value of VCP units granted in 2020 was set at $200.00 per unit. No other changes were made to the terms of the award. The VCP Units, prior to modification, were classified as equity awards and share-based compensation expense was based on the grant date fair value of the award. The setting of the value per unit resulted in a change in the classification of the award from equity to liability as the VCP Units do not expose the holder to gains and losses in the fair value of the Group in the same way as outright ownership. The change in the classification was accounted for as a modification and resulted in an incremental cost of $299.10 per unit and $157 per unit for VCP Units granted in 2018 and 2020 respectively resulting in a total additional incremental compensation cost at the date of modification of $364 million. $26 million of compensation cost based on the fairvalue-based measure of the original award was reclassified from additional paid in capital to share-based payment liability on the date of modification. As a liability classified award, the fair-value-based measure is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The changes in the fair-value-based measure are recognized as compensation cost (with a corresponding increase or decrease in the share-based liability) either immediately or over the employee’s remaining requisite service period or non-employee’s vesting period, depending on the vested status of the award. For unvested awards, the percentage of the fair-value-based measure that is recognized as compensation cost at the end of each period is based on the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered.

For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, compensation cost arising from the VCP was $1 million, $7 million and $383 million respectively. The final tranche of the award was settled in July 2023 and the total fair-value-based measure of share-based liabilities paid during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $176 million, $nil and $238 million respectively and there were no outstanding VCP units remaining outstanding as of December 31, 2023. _FanDuel Value Creation Award (the “VCA”) In March 2023, the Group modified the FanDuel Value Creation Award (the_ “VCA”) within the FanDuel business to provide a minimum payment to the participants. The setting of a minimum payout resulted in a change in the classification of the award from equity to liability as the VCA awards do not expose the holder to gains and losses in the fair value of the Group in the same way as outright ownership. This resulted in a total additional incremental compensation cost at the date of modification of $2 million. $1 million of compensation cost based on the fairvalue-based measure of the original award was reclassified from additional paid in capital to share-based payment liability. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, compensation cost arising from the VCP was $4 million, $1 million and $1 million respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the fair-value-based measure of the liability recorded in other noncurrent liabilities for the award was $5 million and there was approximately $7 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the VCA, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.00 years. There were no amounts paid during the year. _International Plans_ In 2021, the Group introduced plans for certain employees within the International segment that allow them to share in the future growth of their business. A portion of the awards vested in 2023, with the remainder vesting through 2025. These awards have been classified as liability awards as the settlement of the awards does not expose the holder to gains and losses in the fair value of the Group in the same way as outright ownership. As a liability classified award, the fair-value-based measure is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The changes in the fair-value-based measure are recognized as compensation cost (with a corresponding increase or decrease in the share-based liability) either immediately or over the employee’s remaining requisite service period or non-employee’s vesting period, depending on the vested status of the award. For unvested awards, the percentage of the fair-value-based measure that is recognized as compensation cost at the end of each period is based on the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, compensation cost arising from these plans was $3 million, $31 million and $7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $10 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to these plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.66 years. The total fair-value-based measure of share-based liabilities paid during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $12 million, $nil and $nil million respectively and as of December 31, 2023, the fair-value-based measure of the liability recorded in other non-current liabilities for the awards was $29 million (2022: $38 million). In 2021, the Group also introduced an award plan for management of the International segment comprising of internal strategic milestones and a value creation element, vesting in two tranches in July 2023 and December 2025. The awards were liability classified as the awards were based on a fixed amount and settled in a variable number of shares at the vesting date. In December 2022, the Group modified the portion of the tranche vesting in December 2025 to be a fixed number of shares resulting in equity classification for the remaining vesting term. On the modification date, the amounts previously recorded as a share-based payment liability were reclassified as a component of equity in the form of a credit to additional paid in capital amounting to $3 million. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, compensation cost arising from the December 2025 tranche was $3 million, $2 million and $1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $4 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the December 2025 tranche, which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 1.53 years. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, compensation cost arising from the July 2023 tranche was $3 million, $9 million and $8 million, respectively. The share-based payment liabilities with a fair value of $20 million were settled in July 2023 and there were no remaining balances outstanding as of December 31, 2023 in respect of the July 2023 tranche. ## F-46 ----- _Other plans_ In addition to the plans disclosed above, the Group maintains the Betfair Long Term Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Incentive Plan; the Flutter Entertainment plc Sharesave Scheme; the Flutter Entertainment plc 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan; the Flutter Entertainment plc 2015 Medium Term Incentive Plan, the Flutter Entertainment plc 2015 Deferred Share Incentive Plan; and The Stars Group Equity Plans, which are equity-classified awards with compensation cost recognized over the requisite service based on the fair-value-based measure of the award on the grant date. During the year a total of 335,869 awards were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $76.19. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, compensation cost arising from these plans was $22 million, $19 million and $31 million, respectively. At the year end there was a total of 1,211,354 restricted awards and options were outstanding for these plans as of December 31, 2023.

Although the Group has determined that a number of the bonds fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, there are a class of bonds which have been classified as Level 2 due to the existence of relatively inactive trading markets for those bonds. Derivative financial assets and liabilities – Swap agreements The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate and foreign currency risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, such as yield curves, spot and forward FX rates. The Group incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own non-performance risk and the applicable counterparty’s non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, the Group has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. Although the Group has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. At the years ended at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Group assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions, determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives.

The EBITDA multiple used to develop the level 3 fair value measured was 8.08 for the year ended December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 8.8), which was based on ## F-48 ----- the guideline public company method. An increase in the input would result in an increase in the investments in equity securities valuation; a decrease in the input would result in a decrease in the investments in equity securities valuation. The total unrecognized loss of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: $6 million gain, December 31, 2021: $2 million gain) is recognized with other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss). Non-derivative financial instruments _Fox Option Liability_ On October 2, 2019, the Group entered into an arrangement with Fox Corporation (“Fox”), pursuant to which FSG Services LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fox, has an option (the Fox Option) to acquire an 18.6% equity interest of the then outstanding investor units (the “Fastball Units”) in FanDuel Group Parent LLC (“FanDuel”). In April 2021, Fox filed an arbitration claim against the Group with respect to its option to acquire an 18.6% equity interest in FanDuel seeking the same price that the Group paid for the acquisition of the Fastball Units (37.2% of FanDuel) from Fastball Holdings LLC in December 2020. On November 7, 2022, the arbitration tribunal determined the option price as of December 2020 to be $3.7 billion plus an annual escalator of 5%. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the option price was $4.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. Fox has a ten-year period from December 2020 within which to exercise the Fox Option, should it wish to do so, and should Fox not exercise within this timeframe, the Fox Option shall lapse. Cash payment is required at the time of exercise and the Fox Option can only be exercised in full. Exercise of the Fox Option requires Fox to be licensed. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Fox Option amounting to $400 million and $220 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities, was determined using an option pricing model. The significant unobservable inputs were the enterprise value of FanDuel, the discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”), the discount for lack of control (“DLOC”), implied volatility and probability of Fox getting licensed. The enterprise value of FanDuel was determined giving an equal weight to the value indications of the discounted cash flow analysis and the guideline public company analysis. The discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis was 21% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The enterprise value (EV)-to-revenue multiple used in the guideline public company analysis was 4.8x and 3.4x for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 5.3x and 5.0x for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, with the ranges of revenue multiples of selected comparable companies being 1.1x–6.2x and 1.1x–5.7x for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The median and arithmetic average for the comparable companies was 2.6x–2.3x and 3.2x–2.6x for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2.1x–2.2x and 2.6x–2.4x for the year ended December 31, 2022. In developing the fair value measurement, management placed greater weight on multiples of peer group companies that were most directly comparable to FanDuel from within the selected guideline public companies. The key value drivers considered while assigning weights to multiples of peer group companies were profitability (profit margins), future growth prospects, and size of peer group companies, among others. The result of this calibration was that a multiple between the third quartile and high end was deemed most appropriate to develop the required fair value measurement. Additionally, management applied a combined 35% and 40% discount for lack of marketability and lack of control for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 respectively. Management estimated the DLOM considering outputs from various securities-based approaches that included the Asian Protective Put, Finnerty method and Protective put (Chaffe) method. A range of DLOMs obtained using these approaches was 13.9% to 21.6%. To cross-verify the estimated DLOM, management also conducted restricted stock studies and observed average or median DLOMs in the range of c. 10.9% to c. 45.0%. Management also considered pre-initial IPO studies that indicate median DLOMs to be potentially in a range of 6.15% to 82%, with an arithmetic average of 46.96% within the population of post-2008 IPOs considered in the study. DLOC was estimated at 18.40% and 20% using implied discounts in previous observable transactions involving FanDuel’s equity ownership and data based on Mergerstat studies for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 respectively. To cross-verify the estimated DLOC, Management has calculated the implied DLOC using the control premium used in goodwill impairment studies. The combined discounts range from 29.7% to 36.0% and 32.2% to 46.5%, with management having selected 35% and 40%, which is on the lower end of the third quartile, but above the arithmetic average as most appropriate to develop the required fair value measurement for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The volatility was 36% and 38% for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, with the volatility range of the selected comparable companies being 23.3%–58.7% for December 31, 2023 and 14.7%–62.7% for December 31, 2022. In developing the fair value measurement, the probability of a market participant submitting to and obtaining a license was estimated at 75% for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. Changes in discount rates, revenue multiples, DLOM, DLOC, volatility and probability of Fox getting licensed, each in isolation, may change the fair value of certain of the Fox Option. Generally, an increase in discount rates, DLOM and DLOC or ## F-49 ----- decrease in revenue multiples, volatility and probability of FOX getting licensed may result in a decrease in the fair value of the Fox Option. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of the Fox Option, the fair value of the Fox Option may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Fox Option may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for FanDuel Group LLC. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the Fox Option may cause the losses ultimately realized on the Fox Option to be different than the unrealized losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. _Redeemable non-controlling interests at fair value_ The terms of symmetrical call and put options agreed between the Group and Boyd require exercise price to be calculated at fair market value without giving effect to DLOM and DLOC. FanDuel’s pre-discount enterprise value determined in the same manner as discussed earlier is considered in measuring the fair value of redeemable non-controlling interests owned by Boyd. _Contingent consideration_ The contingent consideration payable is primarily determined with reference to forecast performance for the acquired businesses during the relevant time periods and the amounts to be paid in such scenarios. The fair value was estimated by assigning probabilities to the potential payout scenarios. The significant unobservable inputs are forecast performance for the acquired businesses. The fair value of contingent consideration is primarily dependent on forecast performance for the acquired businesses in excess of a predetermined base target. An increase and decrease of 10% in the excess over the predetermined base target during the relevant time periods would increase and decrease the value of contingent consideration at December 31, 2023 by $2 million and $2 million, respectively (December 31, 2022: $1 million and $2 million).",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

The Group establishes an accrued liability for legal claims and indemnification claims when the Group determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome. As additional information becomes available, the Group reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigations, which may also revise our estimates. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to these matters may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued. Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, there can be no assurance that our accruals will be sufficient to cover the extent of our potential exposure to losses. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments, or settlements which might be incurred by us in connection with the various proceedings could affect our results of operations and financial condition. _Austrian and German player claims_ The Group has seen a number of player claims in Austria and Germany for reimbursement of historic gaming losses. The basis of these claims is rooted in the Group having provided remote services in Austria and Germany (outside of Schleswig-Holstein) from Maltese entities on the basis of multi-jurisdictional Maltese licenses, which the Group continues to believe is compliant in accordance with EU law. However, the Austrian Courts and certain German Courts consider the Group’s services non-compliant with their respective local laws. The Group strongly disputes the basis of these claims and judgements made by Austrian and German courts in awarding the player’s claims. As of December 31, 2023, the Group expects to settle claims amounting to €14 million ($16 million) and recognized a loss contingency included within Other current liabilities. In addition, there are further claims made against the Group amounting to €40 million ($45 million) as of December 31, 2023, the settlement of which is predicated on the merits of the case and whether the enforcement proceedings are successful in laying claim over the Group’s Maltese assets for settlement of these claims. The ## F-52 ----- Group, based on advice from its legal counsel, believes such cross-border enforcement of judgements is in contravention to Maltese public policy and Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 and has not accrued any liability for these claims. The Group has filed countersuits before the Maltese Civil Court for setting aside these claims. The defendants have also filed garnishee orders with the Maltese Civil Court to attach the Group’s Maltese assets, some of which have already been declined by the Maltese Civil Court. Should the Maltese Courts decide in favor of the Group, there would be grounds for dismissal of all pending player claims instituted against the Group. While the Group believes that it has strong arguments, at this time, the Group is unable to reasonably estimate the likelihood of the outcome due to the complexities and uncertainty around the judicial process. _Tax dispute in relation to operations in Italy_ In December 2022, the Italian Tax Police initiated an investigation of the operations conducted by PokerStars business in Italy (hereinafter referred to as ‘PS Italy’), alleging that PS Italy’s server infrastructure located in Italy amounts to an Italian permanent establishment for corporate tax purposes. PS Italy’s submissions to the Italian Tax Police note that the server and network equipment was in third party locations not at the disposal of PS Italy and performed mere auxiliary automated activities primarily put in place to provide Italian regulators with an interface for reporting of PS Italy’s revenues. Further, PS Italy did not employ or have staff locally. A similar audit of this infrastructure in previous years, at a time when the Group had local employees, resulted in an immaterial Transfer Pricing adjustment being agreed with the Italian Tax Authorities since the Italian Supreme Court ruled that the Group did not have Italian permanent establishment. The Group is fully co-operating with the Italian Tax Authorities competent for the issuance of a formal tax assessment (which has not yet been notified). Considering that the assessment by the Italian Tax Authorities is at an early stage and ongoing and based on currently available information at the time of issue of the consolidated financial statements, the Group is unable to make a reasonable estimate of loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the investigation by the Italian Tax Police. _Cybersecurity Incident_ The Group received notice in August 2023 that certain customer and employee data was involved in the global incident involving the MOVEit file transfer software, which began when the third-party provider administering the software announced that it had identified a previously unknown vulnerability in MOVEit. The Group had previously used MOVEit to share data and manage file transfers similar to many companies globally. Once the Group was informed of the incident, the Group promptly undertook responsive measures, including restricting access to the affected application, launching an internal investigation in partnership with outside independent cybersecurity forensic and notifying the relevant regulators and law enforcement agencies, as well as our employees and customers, impacted by the incident. Based on this investigation and information currently known at this time, the Group cannot determine or predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or any related claims or reasonably provide an estimate or range of the possible outcome or loss, if any, though the Group does not expect that this incident will have a material impact on our operations or financial results. However, the Group has incurred and may continue to incur, expenses related to existing or future claims arising from this incident. _Goods and Services Tax rate applicable to operations in India_ With effect from October 1, 2023, the Indian Parliament confirmed an increase in the goods and services tax (“GST”) rate from 18% to 28% and determined the tax base should be player deposits. India’s Goods and Services Tax Council (the “GST Tax Authorities”) is currently investigating the historical characterization of services for taxation and therefore the GST rate applicable to products such as rummy, fantasy games and poker offered by online gaming businesses. Industry precedent for products characterized as ‘games of skill’ has been to subject them to a tax of 18% on commission charged from players, whereas the GST Tax Authorities are asserting that the products should be characterized as ‘games of chance’ and are subject to a higher tax of 28% on the amount staked by players. The GST Tax Authorities have issued tax demand notices to several online gaming businesses. The Group operations in India (Junglee and Sachiko) have received requests from the GST Authorities for information, but have not received a tax demand notice. The lead case, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence versus Gameskraft Technologies Private Limited, for the pursual of underpaid GST of $2.6 billion, was ruled in favor of Gameskraft, the taxpayer, at the Karnataka High Court in May 2023, who found the taxes had been paid in accordance with the law, but the case is now being appealed at the Indian Supreme Court. On January 8, 2024, the Indian Supreme Court also issued a notice to the Directorate General of GST Intelligence in response to petitions filed by the E-Gaming Federation, Games24x7 and Head Digital Works challenging the government’s ## F-53 ----- decision to retrospectively impose 28% GST on amounts staked by players and directed the government and the GST department to file their response. The case remains unresolved at the time of issue of the consolidated financial statements. Since these matters are still developing, the Group is unable to predict the outcome. As of the date of issue of the consolidated financial statements the Group is still assessing the quantum on any potential claim by the GST Tax Authorities and is unable to make a reasonable estimate of any reasonably possible loss or range of losses, if any, were the Group to receive a tax demand notice and there was an adverse final decision in the case pending before the Indian Supreme Court.",N/A,as_expected,2024,453

After giving effect to the Assumption Agreement, the aggregate principal amount of Term B loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement will increase by $514 million (the “First Incremental Term B Loans”), which shall be fungible with the existing Term B loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
