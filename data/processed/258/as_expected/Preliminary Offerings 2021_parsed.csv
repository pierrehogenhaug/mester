Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual performance and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the market in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this offering circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and the development of the market in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ from those reflected in forward-looking statements include, without limitation: - risks related to the effects of natural or man-made disasters, including pandemics such as COVID-19; - our ability to identify, sign and retain recording artists and songwriters and the existence or absence of superstar releases; - our inability to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate; - the ability to further develop a successful business model applicable to a digital environment and to enter into artist services and expanded-rights deals with recording artists in order to broaden our revenue streams in growing segments of the music entertainment business; - the popular demand for particular recording artists and/or songwriters and music and the timely delivery to us of music by major recording artists and/or songwriters; - the diversity and quality of our recording artists, songwriters and releases; - slower growth in streaming adoption and revenue; - our dependence on a limited number of digital music services for the online distribution and marketing of our music and their ability to significantly influence the pricing structure for online music stores; - trends, developments or other events in some foreign countries in which we operate; iv ----- - risks associated with our non-U.S. operations, including limited legal protections of our intellectual property rights and restrictions on the repatriation of capital; - unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations; - the impact of heightened and intensive competition in the recorded music and music publishing industries and our inability to execute our business strategy; - significant fluctuations in our operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock from period to period; - our failure to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel; - a significant portion of our revenues are subject to rate regulation either by government entities or by local third-party collecting societies throughout the world and rates on other income streams may be set by governmental proceedings, which may limit our profitability; - risks associated with obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights; - our involvement in intellectual property litigation; - threats to our business associated with digital piracy, including organized industrial piracy; - an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible and long-lived assets; - our failure to have full control and ability to direct the operations we conduct through joint ventures; - the impact of, and risks inherent in, acquisitions or other business combinations; - risks inherent to our outsourcing certain finance and accounting functions; - the fact that we have engaged in substantial restructuring activities in the past, and may need to implement further restructurings in the future and our restructuring efforts may not be successful or generate expected cost savings; - our ability to maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and vendors and our music; - risks related to evolving laws and regulations concerning data privacy which might result in increased regulation and different industry standards; - legislation limiting the terms by which an individual can be bound under a “personal services” contract; - a potential loss of catalog if it is determined that recording artists have a right to recapture U.S. rights in their recordings under the U.S. Copyright Act; - potential employment and withholding liabilities if our recording artists and songwriters are characterized as employees; - any delays and difficulties in satisfying obligations incident to being a public company; - the impact of our substantial leverage on our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, on our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and on our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness; v ----- - the ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and the risk that we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful; - the fact that our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business; - the significant amount of cash required to service our indebtedness and the ability to generate cash or refinance indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control; - our indebtedness levels, and the fact that we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness; - risks of downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us could impact our cost of capital; - the dual class structure of our common stock and Access’s existing ownership of our Class B common stock have the effect of concentrating control over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval with Access;

258,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1427,MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA AND FORECASTS,1427.1,,1427.1.1,,"This offering circular includes, or incorporates by reference, estimates regarding market and industry data and forecasts, including industry size, share of industry sales, industry position, growth rates and penetration rates, which are based on publicly available information, industry publications and surveys, reports from government agencies, reports by market research firms and our own estimates based on our management’s knowledge of, and experience in, the music entertainment industry and market segments in which we compete. Third-party industry publications and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources vi ----- generally believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of included information. The Issuer has not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources nor has the Issuer ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein.

The third-party industry sources referenced, or incorporated by reference, in this offering circular include, among others, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, Nielsen, Music & Copyright, MIDiA and Billboard. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,101
258,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"This offering circular includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios of Parent, including OIBDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA with the meaning and as calculated as set forth in “Offering Circular Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data,” that in each case are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or “U.S. GAAP.” We consider OIBDA to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses, and believe the presentation of OIBDA helps improve the ability to understand our operating performance and evaluate our performance in comparison to comparable periods. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our businesses. Free Cash Flow reflects our net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund our debt service requirements, ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and any dividends, prepayments of debt or repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. As a result, Free Cash Flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method management uses. Because Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Because Free Cash Flow deducts capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments from “net cash provided by operating activities” (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure), users of this information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected. Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to “EBITDA” as defined in our Revolving Credit Facility and in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, and is substantially similar to “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined under the indentures governing our Existing Senior Secured Notes and “EBITDA” as defined under our Senior Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term “EBITDA” as it is commonly used. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business, (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, vii ----- unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies calculate OIBDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA identically (if at all), the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, these measures should not be considered as substitutes for the information contained in the historical financial information of Parent and Warner Music Group prepared in accordance with GAAP included or incorporated by reference herein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

258,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1102,OFFERING CIRCULAR SUMMARY,1102.1,Our Company,1102.1.1,,"We are one of the world’s leading music entertainment companies. Our renowned family of iconic record labels, including Atlantic Records, Warner Records, Elektra Records and Parlophone Records, is home to many of the world’s most popular and influential recording artists. In addition, Warner Chappell Music, our global music publishing business, boasts an extraordinary catalog that includes timeless standards and contemporary hits, representing works by over 80,000 songwriters and composers, with a global collection of more than one million musical compositions. Our entrepreneurial spirit and passion for music has driven our recording artist and songwriter focused innovation for decades. Our Recorded Music business, home to superstar recording artists such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and Cardi B, generated $3.810 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, representing 85% of total revenues. Our Music Publishing business, which includes esteemed songwriters such as Twenty One Pilots, Lizzo and Katy Perry, generated $657 million of revenue in fiscal 2020, representing 15% of total revenues. We benefit from the scale of our global platform and our local focus. Today, global music entertainment companies such as ours are more important and relevant than ever. The traditional barriers to widespread distribution of music have been erased. The tools to make and distribute music are at every musician’s fingertips, and today’s technology makes it possible for music to travel around the world in an instant. This has resulted in music being ubiquitous and accessible at all times. Against this industry backdrop, the volume of music being released on digital platforms is making it harder for recording artists and songwriters to get noticed. We cut through the noise by identifying, signing, developing and marketing extraordinary talent. Our global artists and repertoire (“A&R”) experience and marketing strategies are critical ingredients for recording artists or songwriters who want to build long-term global careers. We believe that the music, not the technology, delights fans and drives the business forward. Our commercial innovation is crucial to maintaining our momentum. We have championed new business models and empowered established players, while protecting and enhancing the value of music. We were the first major music entertainment company to strike landmark deals with important companies such as Apple, YouTube and Tencent Music Entertainment Group, as well as with pure-play music technology companies such as MixCloud, SoundCloud and Audiomack. We adapted to streaming faster than other major music entertainment companies and, in 2016, were the first such company to report that streaming was the largest source of our recorded music revenue. Looking into the future, we believe the universe of opportunities will continue to expand, including through the proliferation of new devices such as smart speakers and the monetization of music on social media and other platforms. We believe advancements in technology will continue to drive consumer engagement and shape a growing and vibrant music entertainment ecosystem.",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

We consider OIBDA to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses, and believe the presentation of OIBDA helps improve the ability to understand our operating performance and evaluate our performance in comparison to comparable periods. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our businesses. Accordingly, OIBDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, OIBDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 8 ----- The following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) from continuing operations to OIBDA and further provides the components from operating income (loss) from continuing operations to net income (loss) for the periods presented:",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund our debt service requirements, ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and any dividends, prepayments of debt or repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. As a result, Free Cash Flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate longterm value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to “EBITDA” as defined in our Revolving Credit Facility and in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, and is substantially similar to “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined under the indentures governing our Existing Senior Secured Notes and “EBITDA” as defined under our Senior Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term “EBITDA” as it is commonly used. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to adjusting net income to exclude interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, also adjusts net income by excluding items or expenses such as, among other items, (1) the amount of any restructuring charges or reserves; (2) any non-cash charges (including any impairment charges); (3) any net loss (gain) resulting from hedging currency exchange risks; (4) the amount of management, monitoring, consulting and advisory fees paid to Access under the Management Agreement or otherwise; (5) business optimization expenses (including consolidation initiatives, severance costs and other 9 ----- costs relating to initiatives aimed at profitability improvement); (6) transaction expenses; (7) equity-based compensation expense; and (8) certain extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. It also includes adjustments for the pro forma impact of certain projected cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies and any quality of earnings analysis prepared by independent certified public accountants in connection with an acquisition, merger, consolidation or other investment. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business; (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of net income, which is the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

In addition, we would have been able to borrow up to $290 million under our Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2021 (giving effect to approximately $10 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2021). Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our investors. For example, it may: - make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes; - increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility; - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable rates; - require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses; - limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all or borrow additional funds in the future for, among other things, working capital, acquisitions or debt service requirements; - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and - limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the Existing Senior Secured Notes (the “Existing Notes _Indentures”) and, upon issuance, the indenture governing the notes offered hereby as well as under the Senior Credit_ Facilities. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, the Existing Notes Indentures and the credit agreements that govern the Senior Credit Facilities contain or will contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Those covenants include restrictions on our ability to, among 12 ----- other things, incur more indebtedness, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions, make investments, create liens, transfer or sell assets, merge or consolidate and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby does not limit our ability to incur unsecured indebtedness, and will allow us to incur substantial secured indebtedness.

Warner Music Group may not maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on its indebtedness.

These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - create liens on certain assets; and - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: - pay dividends on, and redeem and purchase, equity interests; - make investments or other restricted payments; - make prepayments on, redeem or repurchase certain debt; 13 ----- - incur certain liens; - make certain loans and investments; - incur certain additional debt; - enter into guarantees; - enter into mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; - enter into transactions with affiliates; and - pay dividends or make distributions.

These covenants will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - create liens on certain assets; and - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facilities depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. In addition, under the credit agreement governing the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facilities, a financial maintenance covenant is applicable if at the end of a fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and letters of credit is in excess of $105 million. Our failure to comply with obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business or may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise, and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our debt. We may, from time to time, refinance our existing indebtedness, which could result in the agreements governing any new indebtedness having fewer or less restrictive covenants, including removing or lessening restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make restricted payments. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in recording artists and songwriters, capital expenditures or dividends, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indentures governing our outstanding notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

See “— Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the guarantees of the notes, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” In addition, holders of the notes will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under the circumstances described under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Guarantees.” As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a creditor of an entity or the insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of an entity may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or voided.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that we or any of the guarantors did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes or incurring its guarantee to the extent we or such guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of such guarantee.

In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; 17 ----- - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of a guarantee of the notes was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or that guarantee, subordinate the notes of that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the applicable obligor or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee.

Depreciation of the euro against the currency in which you measure your investment returns would cause a decrease in the effective yield of the notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the notes is translated into the currency in which you measure your investment returns.

Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes would be required to render the judgment in euros. The judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars, however, at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors whose home currency is not euros would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a significant amount of time. A U.S. federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the notes would apply the foregoing New York law. To the extent that a judgment is ordered in U.S. dollars, an investor would be subject to exchange risk on the amount they receive in euros due to variation in the exchange rate between the time of judgment and the time of collection. In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars.

The fair value of the collateral securing the notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among other things, the condition of our industry, the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, portions of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes. In addition, in the event of any such proceeding, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon any of the collateral may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations. The notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis with all of our existing and future indebtedness secured pursuant to the same security arrangements and future indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors, foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, or following acceleration of our indebtedness or an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the notes, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities will be entitled to be repaid on an equal and ratable priority basis from the proceeds of collateral. In addition, the security interest of the collateral agent for the notes will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Also, certain items included in the collateral securing the notes, such as licenses and other permits, may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant to applicable law) and therefore the collateral agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of a foreclosure.

In addition, the trustee and collateral agent may not monitor, or we may not inform the trustee and collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The collateral agent for the notes will have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the notes against third parties.

State laws may limit the ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the improved real property collateral located therein. State laws govern the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against real property which secure debt obligations such as the notes. These laws may impose procedural requirements for foreclosure that differ from, and may necessitate a longer time period for completion than, the requirements for foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts, and a right of redemption after foreclosure. The laws of certain states may also impose “security first” or “single action” rules, which limit the type or number of judicial remedies that a creditor may seek in respect of defaults on mortgaged property, and which might affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless of the location of the collateral and limit the right to recover any deficiency following a foreclosure. The holders of the notes, the trustee and the collateral agent for the notes may also be limited in their ability to seek remedies in the event of a breach of the covenant described under “Description of Senior Secured Notes— Certain Covenants.” Judicial decisions in some jurisdictions have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt as a result of a breach of similar covenants. Under these decisions, a lender seeking to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens may be required to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although federal law may preempt, in whole or in part, certain of these decisions, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, courts in certain jurisdictions could prevent the collateral agent from exercising all the remedies available to it pursuant to the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby upon a breach of this covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders to enforce the covenant.",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

Under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, secured creditors are prohibited from repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case without bankruptcy court approval and may be prohibited from disposing of security repossessed from such a debtor without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally permit the debtor to continue to retain collateral, 22 ----- including cash collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but is intended generally to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral with the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security if and at such times as the court, in its discretion, determines that a diminution in the value of the collateral occurs as a result of the stay of repossession or the disposition of the collateral during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, we cannot predict whether or when the collateral agent for the notes could foreclose upon or sell the collateral or whether or to what extent holders of notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” Moreover, the collateral agent may need to evaluate the impact of the potential liabilities before determining to foreclose on collateral consisting of real property, if any, because secured creditors that hold a security interest in real property may be held liable under environmental laws for the costs of remediating or preventing the release or threatened releases of hazardous substances at such real property. Consequently, the collateral agent may decline to foreclose on such collateral or exercise remedies available in respect thereof if it does not receive indemnification to its satisfaction from the holders of the notes. 23 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

Each Authorized Representative agrees that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Notes or the applicable First Lien Obligations) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each holder of the First Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Offered Notes by acceptance thereof, is deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any Proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of First Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the Intercreditor Provisions. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the agreements governing a series of First Lien Obligations, and the Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the 34 ----- proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations, as applicable, is required to be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of First Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of First Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Security Agreement. By agreeing to purchase Offered Notes, each noteholder authorizes the Trustee and the Indenture Authorized Representative (1) (in the case of the Trustee) to appoint the Indenture Authorized Representative to act on its behalf as the Indenture Authorized Representative under the Security Agreement, (2) to appoint the Collateral Agent to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement and under each of the other Security Documents and (3) to authorize the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Security Documents, including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any grantor thereunder to secure any of the First Lien Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Security Agreement provides that the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth therein and in the other Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent: (1) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (2) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Agreement or by the other Security Documents that the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Security Document or applicable law; (3) shall not, except as expressly set forth in Security Agreement and in the other Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a grantor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; (4) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) with the consent or at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (3) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Issuer stating that such action is permitted by the terms of the Security Agreement; and (5) shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under, and as defined in, any series of First Lien Obligations unless and until written notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First Lien Obligations or the Issuer. In addition, among other things, the Collateral Agent will not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (1) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (2) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (3) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, 35 ----- agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (4) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of the Security Agreement, any other Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Security Documents, (5) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral for any series of First Lien Obligations or (6) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any agreement relating to the First Lien Obligations, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent.",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment (a “Change of Control Payment”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase. On or prior to the date that is 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will mail or deliver by electronic transmission a notice to each Holder stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and offering to repurchase Offered Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer. The paying agents will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or applicable authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Offered Notes and other Euro-denominated Notes. The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering 37 ----- Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Offered Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Offered Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of such Offered Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to such Change of Control Offer, to redeem all Offered Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of such redemption (subject to the rights of Holders of such Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date). Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Issuer may prohibit the Issuer from repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event unless such Indebtedness has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of those creditors accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. As described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer also has the right to redeem the Offered Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or otherwise. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.” The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this “Description of Senior Secured Notes” as the “Suspension Period.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Subsidiary to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period (or upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time arising out of actions taken or events that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date the Issuer and any Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising prior to such Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, and shall have no liability for any actions taken or events that occurred during the Suspension Period, or for any actions taken or events occurring at any time pursuant to any such commitment or obligation.

So long as the notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees) will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture governing the notes offered hereby. In addition, participants, whether direct or indirect, in Euroclear, or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may be, which may change from time to time.

Payments of all such amounts will be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by law.

The following summaries of those operations and procedures are provided solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that respective settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. 76 ----- We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, as the case may be, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 77 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

The purchase agreement will also provide that if an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the offering may be terminated. The initial purchasers propose to offer the notes in the United States and Canada initially at the offering prices on the cover page of this offering circular. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. Certain initial purchasers have informed us that they may resell the notes to or through one or more of their affiliates or selling agents. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each of the initial purchasers has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the notes (i) as part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells notes in reliance on Regulation S during such 40-day period, a confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in such offering), may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. We will agree to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities or to contribute to payments which they may be required to make in that respect. The notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no market. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and may be limited during any exchange offer for the notes and the pendency of any shelf registration statement relating to the notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the notes. We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the closing date specified on the cover page of this offering circular, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the SEC under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisor. 81 ----- The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. - Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. - Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. - Covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. - Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates have in the past and may in the future engage in investment banking or other transactions of a financial nature with us, Access and our respective affiliates, for which they have received customary compensation. We intend to use the net proceeds of the notes offered hereby, together with available cash, to redeem the 3.625% Notes. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may hold positions in the 3.625% Notes and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering. Furthermore, banking affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers are lenders and agents under our Revolving Credit Facility and are lenders and agents under our Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement. The decision of these initial purchasers to distribute the notes was made independent of the lenders with which they are affiliated, which lenders have no involvement in determining whether or when to distribute the notes under this offering or the terms of the offering.",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturer's target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer`s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA.

For example, we are required to pay 101% of the principal amount of any note purchased by us at the Holder’s election after a change of control, as described above under the heading “Description of Senior Secured Notes— Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”. U.S. Treasury regulations provide special rules for contingent payment debt instruments that, if applicable, could cause the timing, amount and character of a Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the notes to be different from those described below. We intend to treat the possibility of our making any of the above payments as not causing the notes to be contingent payment debt instruments. Our treatment will be binding on all Holders, except a Holder that discloses its differing treatment in a statement attached to its timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year during which such Holder acquired its notes. However, our treatment is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). If the IRS were to challenge our treatment, a Holder might be required to accrue income on the notes in excess of stated interest and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital 84 ----- gain, gain recognized on the disposition of the notes. In any event, if we actually make any such payment, the timing, amount and character of a Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the notes may be affected. Each Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments and any such payment that it actually receives.

258,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1107,U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,1107.2,U.S. Holders,1107.2.1,Interest on the Notes,"In general, interest payable on a note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income when it is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The notes are not expected to be issued with more than de minimis original issue discount (“OID”). However, if the notes are issued with more than de minimis OID, each U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income (as interest) as it accrues, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, using a constant yield method, before such U.S. Holder receives any payment attributable to such income. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not issued with more than _de minimis OID._ The amount of interest paid with respect to a note that is includible in income by a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the U.S. dollar value of the amount paid in euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received by such U.S. Holder. The amount of interest on a note that is includible in income by a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the U.S. dollar value of such interest income that accrued during the relevant accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued interest income generally is determined by translating such interest income at the average rate of exchange for such accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the taxable year). Alternatively, such U.S. Holder may elect to translate such interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of such accrual period (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year). If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of receipt of the payment in respect of the related accrued interest, a U.S. Holder that has made such election may translate such accrued interest using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of such payment. The above election will apply to all debt obligations held by such U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such accrued interest income on the date the payment in respect of such interest income is received if there is any difference between the rate of exchange used to determine such interest income and the rate of exchange on the date such payment is received. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder generally will have a basis in euro received with respect to payments of interest on a note equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a conversion or other disposition of such euro by such U.S. Holder generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,101

A U.S. Holder that receives euro on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note generally will have an amount realized equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (or, if such note is treated as traded on an established securities market, on the settlement date in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer). A U.S. Holder generally will realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss upon such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (as ordinary income or loss) if there is any difference between (i) the spot rate of exchange on the date such U.S. Holder acquired such note (or, if applicable, the settlement date for such acquisition) and (ii) the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment in respect of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition is received or 85 ----- the date such note is disposed of, as applicable. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss, together with any foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on such disposition in respect of accrued interest, generally will be realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the note. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note that is not treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder has held such note for more than one year at the time of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition. Net long-term capital gain of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders generally is subject to preferential rates of tax. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder that determines its amount realized in connection with the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note by reference to the spot rate of exchange on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (rather than on the settlement date) may recognize additional foreign currency exchange gain or loss upon receipt of euro from such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition. A U.S. Holder generally will have a basis in the euro received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro on the date of receipt.

This discussion is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different interpretation. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to specific Holders (as defined below) in light of their particular circumstances (including Holders that are directly or indirectly related to us and accrual method holders that have an “applicable financial statement”) or to Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (such as banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or other Holders that generally mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities, retirement plans, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, Holders that hold a note as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion or other integrated transaction or U.S. Holders that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar).

This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to Holders that participate in a redemption of the 3.625% Notes. As used in this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (x) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (y) that has in effect a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. As used in this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the term “Holder” means a U.S. Holder or a NonU.S. Holder. If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes invests in a note, the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to such investment will depend in part upon the status and activities of such entity and the particular partner.

If we are a party in interest with respect to an ERISA Plan, the purchase and holding of the notes by or on behalf of the ERISA Plan may be a prohibited transaction under Section 406(a)(1) of ERISA and Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, unless exemptive relief were available under an applicable statutory or administrative exemption or there were some other basis on which the transaction was not prohibited. Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and foreign plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to these “prohibited transaction” rules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar rules under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (such plans, together with the ERISA Plan, the “Plans,” each of which we refer to as a “Plan”). To address the above concerns, the notes may not be purchased by or transferred to any investor unless such investor makes the representations contained in paragraph 5 under “Transfer Restrictions,” which are designed to ensure that the acquisition of the notes will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive.
