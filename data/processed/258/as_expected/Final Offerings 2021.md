### WMG Acquisition Corp.

€445,000,000

2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031

WMG Acquisition Corp. (“Warner Music Group”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WMG Holdings Corp. (“Holdings”) and an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Warner Music Group Corp. (the “Parent”), is offering €445,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.250% Senior Secured Notes
due 2031 (the “notes”). The notes will mature on August 15, 2031. Interest will accrue from August 16, 2021. Warner Music Group will pay interest on
the notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year commencing February 15, 2022. We cannot assure you that the Transactions (as defined herein)
will be consummated in accordance with their terms, or at all.

The notes will be redeemable on or after August 15, 2026 at the redemption prices specified in this listing circular. At any time prior to August 15,

2026, Warner Music Group will be entitled to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their respective principal
amount plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, during any 12-month period
prior to August 15, 2026, Warner Music Group may redeem up to 10% of the notes at a redemption price equal to 101.125% of their principal amount,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Warner Music Group may also redeem up to 40% of the notes before August
15, 2026, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings or
contributions to its capital at the redemption price specified in this listing circular.

The notes offered hereby will be guaranteed, on a senior secured basis, by all of Warner Music Group’s existing wholly-owned domestic restricted

subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities (as defined in this listing circular), subject to customary exceptions. The notes
and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on substantially all of Warner Music Group’s assets, the assets of
Holdings and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors as described in this listing circular (the “Collateral”). The notes will, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral, be effectively (i) senior to Warner Music Group’s future indebtedness secured by liens on the Collateral that are junior to the liens on the
Collateral securing the notes, (ii) senior to Warner Music Group’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and (iii) equal with Warner Music Group’s
existing and future indebtedness secured by liens on the Collateral that are not senior or junior to the liens on the Collateral securing the notes, including
Warner Music Group’s outstanding 3.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “3.625% Notes”) to the extent the 3.625% Notes are not redeemed in
full as described under “Listing Circular Summary—Recent Developments—Redemption”, 2.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “2.750%
_Notes”), 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “3.000% Notes”) and 3.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the “3.875% Notes” and, together_
with the 3.625% Notes, the 2.750% Notes and the 3.000% Notes, the “Existing Senior Secured Notes”) and indebtedness under the Senior Credit
Facilities.

The notes and the related guarantees will be Warner Music Group’s and the guarantors’ general secured senior obligations and will rank senior to

all their future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes. The notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of Warner
Music Group’s existing and future liabilities that are not so subordinated, including the Existing Senior Secured Notes, and indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Facilities, and will be structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of Warner Music Group’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes,
to the extent of the assets of those subsidiaries.

Warner Music Group does not intend to file an exchange offer registration statement with respect to the notes.
Warner Music Group intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of the notes, together with available cash, to repurchase, redeem or discharge

any and all of the 3.625% Notes currently outstanding. See “Listing Circular Summary—Recent Developments—Redemption.”

**Investing in the notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” on page 12.**

**Notes** **Price: 100.0%**

plus accrued interest, if any, from August 16, 2021, if settlement occurs after such date

Warner Music Group has applied to list the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF Market.
We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream

Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”), in each case on or about August 16, 2021.

The notes and the related guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities

_Act”). The notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons, except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the_
exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
Securities Act. This listing circular constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg law on prospectuses for securities dated July 16,
2019.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market - Solely for the**

purposes of the manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led
to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each
as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer's target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer`s target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the**

purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has
led to the conclusion that (i) the target market for the notes is only eligible counterparties as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as
it forms part of domestic law of the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook
Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRIIPs regulation - prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors – The notes are not intended to be offered,**

sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014, as amended (the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.

**UK PRIIPs regulation - prohibition of sales to UK retail investors – The notes are not intended to be**

offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

-----

without limitation, all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this listing
circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein and include, without limitation, consummation of the
Transactions, including the offer and sale of the notes offered hereby, in accordance with their terms, or at all, our
ability to compete in the highly competitive markets in which we operate, statements regarding our ability to
develop talent and attract future talent, our ability to reduce future capital expenditures, our ability to monetize our
music, including through new distribution channels and formats to capitalize on the growth areas of the music
entertainment industry, our ability to effectively deploy our capital, the development of digital music and the effect
of digital distribution channels on our business, including whether we will be able to achieve higher margins from
digital sales, the success of strategic actions we are taking to accelerate our transformation as we redefine our role in
the music entertainment industry, the effectiveness of our ongoing efforts to reduce overhead expenditures and
manage our variable and fixed cost structure and our ability to generate expected cost savings from such efforts, our
success in limiting piracy, the growth of the music entertainment industry and the effect of our and the industry’s
efforts to combat piracy on the industry, Parent’s intention to pay dividends or repurchase or retire our outstanding
debt or notes in open market purchases, privately or otherwise, the impact on us of potential strategic transactions,
our ability to fund our future capital needs and the effect of litigation on us.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be

beyond our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or
outcomes and that actual performance and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the market in which we operate, may differ materially from
those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this listing circular and the documents
incorporated by reference herein. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows,
and the development of the market in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this listing circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein, those results or developments
may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. New factors emerge from time to time that
may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Factors that
could cause actual results and outcomes to differ from those reflected in forward-looking statements include,
without limitation:

  - risks related to the effects of natural or man-made disasters, including pandemics such as COVID-19;

  - our ability to identify, sign and retain recording artists and songwriters and the existence or absence of
superstar releases;

  - our inability to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate;

  - the ability to further develop a successful business model applicable to a digital environment and to enter
into artist services and expanded-rights deals with recording artists in order to broaden our revenue streams
in growing segments of the music entertainment business;

  - the popular demand for particular recording artists and/or songwriters and music and the timely delivery to
us of music by major recording artists and/or songwriters;

  - the diversity and quality of our recording artists, songwriters and releases;

  - slower growth in streaming adoption and revenue;

  - our dependence on a limited number of digital music services for the online distribution and marketing of
our music and their ability to significantly influence the pricing structure for online music stores;

  - trends, developments or other events in some foreign countries in which we operate;

  - risks associated with our non-U.S. operations, including limited legal protections of our intellectual
property rights and restrictions on the repatriation of capital;

  - unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations;

iv


-----

- the impact of heightened and intensive competition in the recorded music and music publishing industries
and our inability to execute our business strategy;

- significant fluctuations in our operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock from
period to period;

- our failure to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel;

- a significant portion of our revenues are subject to rate regulation either by government entities or by local
third-party collecting societies throughout the world and rates on other income streams may be set by
governmental proceedings, which may limit our profitability;

- risks associated with obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights;

- our involvement in intellectual property litigation;

- threats to our business associated with digital piracy, including organized industrial piracy;

- an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible and long-lived assets;

- our failure to have full control and ability to direct the operations we conduct through joint ventures;

- the impact of, and risks inherent in, acquisitions or other business combinations;

- risks inherent to our outsourcing certain finance and accounting functions;

- the fact that we have engaged in substantial restructuring activities in the past, and may need to implement
further restructurings in the future and our restructuring efforts may not be successful or generate expected
cost savings;

- our ability to maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and vendors and
our music;

- risks related to evolving laws and regulations concerning data privacy which might result in increased
regulation and different industry standards;

- legislation limiting the terms by which an individual can be bound under a “personal services” contract;

- a potential loss of catalog if it is determined that recording artists have a right to recapture U.S. rights in
their recordings under the U.S. Copyright Act;

- potential employment and withholding liabilities if our recording artists and songwriters are characterized
as employees;

- any delays and difficulties in satisfying obligations incident to being a public company;

- the impact of our substantial leverage on our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, on our
ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and on our ability to meet our obligations under
our indebtedness;

- the ability to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and the risk that we may be forced
to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful;

- the fact that our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business;

v


-----

  - the significant amount of cash required to service our indebtedness and the ability to generate cash or
refinance indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control;

  - our indebtedness levels, and the fact that we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which
may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness;

  - risks of downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us could impact
our cost of capital;

  - the dual class structure of our common stock and Access’s existing ownership of our Class B common
stock have the effect of concentrating control over our management and affairs and over matters requiring
stockholder approval with Access; and

  - risks related to other factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in this listing circular and the documents
incorporated by reference herein.

You should read this listing circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein completely and with

the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from expectations. All forward-looking
statements made in this listing circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein are qualified by these
cautionary statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not
undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking or
cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, and
changes in future operating results over time or otherwise. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods
are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and
should only be viewed as historical data.

Other risks, uncertainties and factors, including those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this listing

circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could cause our or Parent’s actual results to differ
materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. You should read carefully the factors
described in the “Risk Factors” section of this listing circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein to
better understand the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and underlying any forward-looking
statements.

**BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

This listing circular includes or incorporates by reference historical consolidated financial statements and

certain financial data of Parent in lieu of consolidated financial statements and financial data of Warner Music
Group, which is the issuer of the notes and Parent’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. Non-disclosure of the
Issuer’s accounts would not be likely to mislead investors with regard to facts and circumstances that are essential
for assessing the securities. Parent is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations
through its subsidiaries and is a reporting company under the Exchange Act. The financial information of Parent is
substantially identical to that of Warner Music Group.

In addition, this listing circular includes or incorporates certain financial information of Warner Music Group.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA AND FORECASTS**

This listing circular includes, or incorporates by reference, estimates regarding market and industry data and

forecasts, including industry size, share of industry sales, industry position, growth rates and penetration rates,
which are based on publicly available information, industry publications and surveys, reports from government
agencies, reports by market research firms and our own estimates based on our management’s knowledge of, and
experience in, the music entertainment industry and market segments in which we compete. Third-party industry
publications and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources
generally believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of included
information. The Issuer has not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources nor has the Issuer
ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Similarly, internal surveys, industry forecasts

vi


-----

and market research, while believed to be reliable, have not been independently verified. The third-party industry
sources referenced, or incorporated by reference, in this listing circular include, among others, the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry, Nielsen, Music & Copyright, MIDiA and Billboard. Our estimates involve
risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the
captions “Risk Factors” and “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

This listing circular includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios of Parent, including OIBDA, Free

Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA with the meaning and as calculated as set forth in “Listing Circular Summary—
Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data,” that in each case are not recognized under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, or “U.S. GAAP.”

We consider OIBDA to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our

businesses, and believe the presentation of OIBDA helps improve the ability to understand our operating
performance and evaluate our performance in comparison to comparable periods. However, a limitation of the use of
OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and
intangible assets used in generating revenue in our businesses.

Free Cash Flow reflects our net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and cash paid or

received for investments. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance.
Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund
our debt service requirements, ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic
acquisitions and investments, and any dividends, prepayments of debt or repurchases or retirement of our
outstanding debt or notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. As a result, Free
Cash Flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know
whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the
presentation of Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance
in a manner similar to the method management uses. Because Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance
calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a
substitute for, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or cash flow provided by operating
activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures employed by other companies. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available
for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Because Free Cash Flow
deducts capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments from “net cash provided by operating
activities” (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure), users of this information should consider
the types of events and transactions that are not reflected.

Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to “EBITDA” as defined in our Revolving Credit Facility and in the indenture

that will govern the notes offered hereby, and is substantially similar to “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined under
the indentures governing our Existing Senior Secured Notes and “EBITDA” as defined under our Senior Term Loan
Facility. Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term “EBITDA” as it is commonly used. While Adjusted EBITDA and
similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements,
these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential
inconsistencies in the method of calculation.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating

performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute
for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the
periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business, (2) it
does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our indebtedness and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital
expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary,
unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may
recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash
flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate

vii


-----

whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most
recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or
weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or
any complete fiscal year. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute
for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Because not all companies calculate OIBDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA identically (if at all), the

presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further,
these measures should not be considered as substitutes for the information contained in the historical financial
information of Parent and Warner Music Group prepared in accordance with GAAP included or incorporated by
reference herein.

**LISTING CIRCULAR SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in, or incorporated by reference into, this listing_

_circular. This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read this entire_
_listing circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein, including the “Risk Factors” section and all_
_the incorporated information, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Parent_
_incorporated by reference herein._

**Our Company**

We are one of the world’s leading music entertainment companies. Our renowned family of iconic record

labels, including Atlantic Records, Warner Records, Elektra Records and Parlophone Records, is home to many of
the world’s most popular and influential recording artists. In addition, Warner Chappell Music, our global music
publishing business, boasts an extraordinary catalog that includes timeless standards and contemporary hits,
representing works by over 80,000 songwriters and composers, with a global collection of more than one million
musical compositions. Our entrepreneurial spirit and passion for music has driven our recording artist and
songwriter focused innovation for decades.

Our Recorded Music business, home to superstar recording artists such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and Cardi B,

generated $3.810 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, representing 85% of total revenues. Our Music Publishing
business, which includes esteemed songwriters such as Twenty One Pilots, Lizzo and Katy Perry, generated $657
million of revenue in fiscal 2020, representing 15% of total revenues. We benefit from the scale of our global
platform and our local focus.

Today, global music entertainment companies such as ours are more important and relevant than ever. The

traditional barriers to widespread distribution of music have been erased. The tools to make and distribute music are
at every musician’s fingertips, and today’s technology makes it possible for music to travel around the world in an
instant. This has resulted in music being ubiquitous and accessible at all times. Against this industry backdrop, the
volume of music being released on digital platforms is making it harder for recording artists and songwriters to get
noticed. We cut through the noise by identifying, signing, developing and marketing extraordinary talent. Our global
artists and repertoire (“A&R”) experience and marketing strategies are critical ingredients for recording artists or
songwriters who want to build long-term global careers. We believe that the music, not the technology, delights fans
and drives the business forward.

Our commercial innovation is crucial to maintaining our momentum. We have championed new business

models and empowered established players, while protecting and enhancing the value of music. We were the first
major music entertainment company to strike landmark deals with important companies such as Apple, YouTube
and Tencent Music Entertainment Group, as well as with pure-play music technology companies such as MixCloud,
SoundCloud and Audiomack. We adapted to streaming faster than other major music entertainment companies and,
in 2016, were the first such company to report that streaming was the largest source of our recorded music revenue.
Looking into the future, we believe the universe of opportunities will continue to expand, including through the
proliferation of new devices such as smart speakers and the monetization of music on social media and other
platforms. We believe advancements in technology will continue to drive consumer engagement and shape a
growing and vibrant music entertainment ecosystem.

**Recent Developments**

At any time (which may be more than once) before August 15, 2026,
we may choose to redeem up to 40% of the notes with proceeds that
we or one of our parent companies raises in one or more equity
offerings, as long as:

are rated investment grade by both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
(“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) and no default or

we and our subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenant requiring
future note guarantors. See ‘‘Description of Senior Secured Notes—
Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated
Investment Grade.’’

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

Set forth below are summary historical consolidated financial and other data of Parent as of the dates and for the

periods indicated. The financial data for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, September 30, 2019 and
September 30, 2018, and as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 have been derived from Parent’s
audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference into this listing circular from Parent’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The financial data as of September 30,
2018 have been derived from audited financial statements not included or incorporated by reference in this listing
circular. The financial data for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and as of June 30, 2021 have been
derived from the unaudited financial statements incorporated by reference into this listing circular from Parent’s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021, which have been prepared on a basis
consistent with Parent’s audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, such unaudited
consolidated financial data reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present
fairly the financial position of Parent and its subsidiaries for those periods. The financial data as of June 30, 2020
have been derived from unaudited financial statements not included or incorporated by reference in this listing
circular. The financial data for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 have been derived by taking the historical
audited financial data for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, less the historical unaudited financial data for
the nine months ended June 30, 2020, plus the historical unaudited financial data for the nine months ended June,
2021. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
the full year or any future period.

This summary financial data should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Parent’s financial statements and notes thereto incorporated by
reference into this listing circular from Parent’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September
30, 2020 and Parent’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021. Historical
results are not indicative of future operating results and results from interim periods are not indicative of full year
results. The following consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet data have been prepared
in conformity with U.S. GAAP. For a discussion of the material differences between the financial information and
historical results of operations of Parent and Warner Music Group, see “Basis of Presentation.”

(1) We evaluate our operating performance based on several factors, including our primary financial measure,
which is operating income (loss) before non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and non-cash amortization of
intangible assets (which we refer to as “OIBDA”). We consider OIBDA to be an important indicator of the
operational strengths and performance of our businesses, and believe the presentation of OIBDA helps improve
the ability to understand our operating performance and evaluate our performance in comparison to
comparable periods. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not
reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our
businesses. Accordingly, OIBDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income
(loss), net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
In addition, OIBDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other
companies.

(2) Free Cash Flow reflects our net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and cash paid or
received for investments. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate our operating
performance. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to fund our debt service requirements, ongoing working capital requirements, capital
expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and any dividends, prepayments of debt or
repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated
purchases or otherwise. As a result, Free Cash Flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate longterm value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of
our operating performance. We believe the presentation of Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful for investors
because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method management uses.

The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow for the periods
presented:

(a) Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 include Los Angeles headquarters construction expenditures of $45 million
and $28 million, respectively.

(b) Reflects acquisition of music publishing rights and music catalogs, net, investments and acquisitions of
businesses, net and proceeds from the sale of investments including, in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 and
fiscal year 2019, the $183 million used to fund the acquisition of EMP, which was entirely debt financed,
and in fiscal year 2018, the cash impact of the net gain of $389 million related to the sale of the Spotify
shares.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to “EBITDA” as defined in our Revolving Credit Facility and in the indenture
that will govern the notes offered hereby, and is substantially similar to “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined
under the indentures governing our Existing Senior Secured Notes and “EBITDA” as defined under our Senior
Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term “EBITDA” as it is commonly used. The
definition of Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to adjusting net income to exclude interest expense, income taxes,
and depreciation and amortization, also adjusts net income by excluding items or expenses such as, among
other items, (1) the amount of any restructuring charges or reserves; (2) any non-cash charges (including any
impairment charges); (3) any net loss (gain) resulting from hedging currency exchange risks; (4) the amount of
management, monitoring, consulting and advisory fees paid to Access under the Management Agreement or
otherwise; (5) business optimization expenses (including consolidation initiatives, severance costs and other

10


-----

costs relating to initiatives aimed at profitability improvement); (6) transaction expenses; (7) equity-based
compensation expense; and (8) certain extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. It also includes
adjustments for the pro forma impact of certain projected cost savings, operating expense reductions and
synergies and any quality of earnings analysis prepared by independent certified public accountants in
connection with an acquisition, merger, consolidation or other investment.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating
performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it
does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating
revenue for our business; (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary
to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure,
future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back
certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income;
however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted
EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined
by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs.
Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can
be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the
measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. Accordingly,
Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other
measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of net income, which is the most directly comparable measure calculated in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented:

(a) For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, reflects a net loss incurred on the early extinguishment of
our debt as part of the April 2021 redemption of our 5.500% Senior Notes in the third quarter of fiscal
2021, as well as the redemption of our 4.125% Senior Secured Notes and 4.875% Senior Secured Notes,
the tender for and redemption of the 5.000% Senior Secured Notes and the partial repayment of the
Senior Term Loan Facility, all of which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.

(b) Reflects net gain on sale of securities and divestitures.

(c) Reflects severance costs and other restructuring related expenses.

(d) Reflects losses (gains) from hedging activities and unrealized losses (gains) due to foreign exchange on
our Euro-denominated debt and intercompany transactions.

(e) Reflects management fees and related expenses paid to Access pursuant to the management agreement
which was terminated upon completion of the IPO in June 2020.

(f) Reflects mainly integration, transaction and qualifying IPO costs.

(g) Reflects costs associated with our transformation initiatives and IT system updates, which includes costs
of $28 million related to our finance transformation for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

(h) Reflects non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the Warner Music Group Corp. Senior
Management Free Cash Flow Plan and the Omnibus Incentive Plan.

(i) Reflects non-cash activity, including the unrealized losses (gains) on the mark-to-market of an equity
method investment, investment losses (gains) and other non-cash impairments.

(j) Reflects expected savings resulting from transformation initiatives and pro forma impact of specified
transactions for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Certain of these cost savings initiatives and
transactions impacted quarters prior to the quarter during which they were identified within the last
twelve-month period. The pro forma impact of these specified transactions and initiatives resulted in a
$15 million increase in the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA.

(k) The fiscal year 2018 included a net gain of $389 million, pre-tax, related to the sale of Spotify shares
acquired in the ordinary course of business.

(4) We define leverage ratio as the ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe the leverage ratio is useful

to investors as an alternative liquidity measure. Net Debt is total debt of Warner Music Group net of cash and
equivalents of Warner Music Group not exceeding $250 million. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the notes involves risks. You should consider carefully the risks relating to the notes and the risks_

_relating to the collateral described below and the risk factors and other information contained in Parent’s Annual_
_Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and Parent’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q_
_for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 that are incorporated by_
_reference in this listing circular, before making a decision to invest in the notes. See “Incorporation by Reference;_
_Where You Can Find Additional Information.” The risks and uncertainties described in this listing circular and in_
_the documents incorporated by reference herein may not be the only ones facing us. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely_
_impact our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or_
_results of operations would likely suffer. In such case, the trading prices of the notes could fall, and you may lose all_
_or part of the money you paid to buy the notes._

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness on a consolidated basis could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital_**
**_to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from_**
**_meeting our obligations under our indebtedness, including the notes._**

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, our total consolidated indebtedness would have

been $3,367 million. In addition, we would have been able to borrow up to $290 million under our Revolving Credit
Facility as of June 30, 2021 (giving effect to approximately $10 million of letters of credit outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2021).

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our investors. For example, it may:

  - make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes;

  - increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of
significant inflation and financial market volatility;

  - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the revolving
portion of our Senior Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable rates;

  - require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby
reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses;

  - limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all or borrow additional funds in
the future for, among other things, working capital, acquisitions or debt service requirements;

  - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we
operate;

  - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and

  - limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the

restrictions contained in the indentures governing the Existing Senior Secured Notes (the “Existing Notes
_Indentures”) and, upon issuance, the indenture governing the notes offered hereby as well as under the Senior Credit_
Facilities. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now
face could intensify.

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, the Existing Notes Indentures and the credit agreements

that govern the Senior Credit Facilities contain or will contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in
activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Those covenants include restrictions on our ability to, among

13


-----

other things, incur more indebtedness, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions, make investments,
create liens, transfer or sell assets, merge or consolidate and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Our
failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result
in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. See also “—Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our
flexibility in operating our business” and “—The indenture that will govern the notes will contain limited
covenants.”

**_Despite our indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the_**
**_risks created by our substantial indebtedness._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the

future. None of the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities or the Existing Note Indentures fully
prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. The indenture
that will govern the notes offered hereby does not limit our ability to incur unsecured indebtedness, and will allow
us to incur substantial secured indebtedness. If we or our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence
ratios set forth in the Existing Note Indentures and the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities, we
or our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by
our current substantial indebtedness.

Our ability to incur secured indebtedness, including the notes, is subject to compliance with certain secured

leverage ratios that are calculated as of the date of incurrence. The amount of secured indebtedness that we are able
to incur and the timing of any such incurrence under these ratios vary from time to time and are a function of several
variables, including our outstanding indebtedness and our results of operations calculated as of specified dates or for
certain periods. There can be no assurance that if we incur secured indebtedness in this offering in compliance with
such ratios, we would be able to incur the same amount of or any secured indebtedness on any future date.

**_Warner Music Group may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be_**
**_forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Warner Music Group’s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its debt obligations depends on

its financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive
conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Warner Music Group may not
maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
and interest on its indebtedness.

Warner Music Group will rely on its subsidiaries to make payments on its borrowings. If these subsidiaries do

not dividend funds to Warner Music Group in an amount sufficient to make such payments, if necessary in the
future, Warner Music Group may default under the Existing Notes Indentures, or the indenture that will govern the
notes offered hereby, which would result in all such notes becoming due and payable.

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

The Existing Notes Indentures (assuming the redemption in full of the 3.625% Notes) contain various covenants

that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of
our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - create liens on certain assets; and

  - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

In addition, the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that

limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

  - pay dividends on, and redeem and purchase, equity interests;

  - make investments or other restricted payments;

  - make prepayments on, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

14


-----

  - incur certain liens;

  - make certain loans and investments;

  - incur certain additional debt;

  - enter into guarantees;

  - enter into mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;

  - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

  - pay dividends or make distributions.

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain various covenants that limit our ability to

engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted
subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - create liens on certain assets; and

  - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facilities depends

upon satisfaction of these covenants. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility
were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination
that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein. Events beyond our
control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. In addition, under the credit agreement governing the
revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facilities, a financial maintenance covenant is applicable if at the end of a
fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and letters of credit is in excess of $105 million.

Our failure to comply with obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event

of default under such instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults.
A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated,
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or will have the
ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.

All of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business or may limit our ability to take

advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise, and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of
our debt. We may, from time to time, refinance our existing indebtedness, which could result in the agreements
governing any new indebtedness having fewer or less restrictive covenants, including removing or lessening
restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make restricted payments.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to

reduce or delay investments in recording artists and songwriters, capital expenditures or dividends, or to sell assets,
seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be
successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating
results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material
assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indentures governing our outstanding notes
restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from dispositions. We may not be able to consummate
those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be
adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. While subject to certain restrictions in our debt agreements,
if we were to pay dividends to our shareholders, the funds used to make such dividend payments would not be
available to service our indebtedness.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee of the notes may be reduced to zero, avoided or released_**
**_under certain circumstances, holders of the notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the_**
**_guarantors._**

The guarantees of the notes provided by our subsidiary guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the

guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under a guarantee
could be reduced to zero depending on the amount of other obligations of such entity. Further, under certain
circumstances, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes or other applicable laws could
void the obligations under a guarantee or subordinate the guarantee to other obligations of the guarantor. See “—
Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the guarantees of the notes,
and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” In addition, holders of the notes will lose the
benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under the circumstances described under “Description of Senior
Secured Notes—Guarantees.”

As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon

the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee
issued by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee exceeds
the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a creditor of an entity or the
insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of an entity may contest the validity and enforceability of the
guarantee and the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or voided. If any guarantees
are deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee
apply, the notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable guarantor, including trade
payables of such guarantor.

**_If the guarantees under certain other indebtedness are released or terminated, those guarantors will be released_**
**_from their guarantees of the notes._**

If a subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities or the notes, then the

guarantee of the notes by such subsidiary will be released automatically without action by, or consent of, any holder
of the notes or the trustee under the relevant indenture. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Guarantees.”
You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the
indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will
effectively be senior to claims of holders of the notes.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. The ability to generate cash or_**
**_refinance indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness, including

the notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures and other corporate expenses will depend on our future operating
performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative and other factors and any legal and regulatory
restrictions on the payment of distributions and dividends to which they may be subject. Many of these factors are
beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that
currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our
other needs. To satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, we must
continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may need to reduce or delay our planned
capital expenditures or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Significant delays in our
planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at
all. While limited by the terms of our debt agreements, if we were to pay dividends to our shareholders, the funds
used to make such dividend payments would not be available to service our indebtedness.

**_If we or our subsidiaries default on our or their obligations to pay our or their indebtedness, we may not be able_**
**_to make payments on the notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Senior Credit

Facilities that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness
could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes and such other indebtedness when
due and substantially decrease the market value of the notes and such other indebtedness.

16


-----

If we or our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds

necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we
otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including
covenants in the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities or the indentures governing our
indebtedness, including the Existing Notes Indentures), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements
governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all
the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under
the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and cease
making further loans, and holders of such indebtedness that is secured could institute foreclosure proceedings
against our assets, which could further result in a cross-default or cross-acceleration of our debt issued under other
instruments, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facilities, the notes, our other indebtedness or other debt of our subsidiaries are accelerated, all our non-guarantor
subsidiaries’ debt and liabilities would be payable from our subsidiaries’ assets, prior to any distributions of our
subsidiaries’ assets to pay interest and principal on the notes and our other indebtedness, and we might not be able to
repay or make any payments on the notes and our other indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of a change of control event specified in the Existing Notes Indentures or upon the

occurrence of a change of control triggering event specified in the indenture that will govern the notes offered
hereby, we will be required to offer to repurchase all our respective outstanding debt securities issued under such
indentures (unless otherwise redeemed) at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. It is possible, however, that we would not have sufficient funds
available at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of such indebtedness. We may be
unable to repay all of that indebtedness or to obtain such consent. Any requirement to offer to repurchase
outstanding debt securities may therefore require us to refinance our other outstanding debt, which we may not be
able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. A change of control may constitute an event of default under
the Senior Credit Facilities. In addition, our failure to repurchase the notes and the Existing Senior Secured Notes
after a change of control or change of control triggering event, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable indenture would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which in turn would result in a
default under the Senior Credit Facilities, resulting in the acceleration of the indebtedness represented by the notes
and under the Senior Credit Facilities.

**_Certain corporate events may not trigger a change of control event, in which case we will not be required to_**
**_redeem the notes._**

The Existing Notes Indentures permit and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit us

to engage in certain important corporate events that would increase indebtedness or alter our business but would not
constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the applicable indenture. If we effected a leveraged recapitalization or
other such non-change of control transaction that resulted in an increase in indebtedness or fundamentally changed
our business, our ability to make payments on the notes would be adversely affected. However, we would not be
required to redeem the notes, and you might be required to continue to hold your notes, despite our decreased ability
to meet our obligations under the notes.

The definition of Change of Control includes a disposition of “all or substantially all of our assets.” Although

there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “substantially all” of our assets. As
a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to
make an offer to repurchase the notes.

**_The indenture that will govern the notes will contain limited covenants._**

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain limited covenants, including those

restricting our ability and the ability of the guarantors to create certain liens on certain assets and our ability to
consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. These limited covenants are
subject to exceptions which, among other things, allow us to incur substantial secured debt and do not restrict the
sale of all or substantially all of our Recorded Music business or Music Publishing business. See “Description of
Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_If the notes are rated investment grade at any time by both Moody’s and S&P, the covenant related to future note_**
**_guarantees and the corresponding event of default contained in the indenture that will govern the notes offered_**
**_hereby will be suspended, resulting in a reduction of credit protection._**

If, at any time, the credit rating on the notes, as determined by both Moody’s and S&P, equals or exceeds Baa3

and BBB, respectively, or any equivalent replacement ratings, and no default has occurred and is continuing under
the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, we will no longer be subject to the covenant related to future
note guarantees and the corresponding event of default contained in the indenture that will govern the notes offered
hereby. Such covenant and corresponding event of default that cease to apply to us as a result of achieving these
ratings will be restored if one or both of the credit ratings on the notes later falls below these thresholds. However,
during any period in which such covenant is suspended, we will not be required to take any actions that would have
been required if such covenant had been in effect. If such covenant is later restored, the actions not taken while the
covenant was suspended will not result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes even if the
absence of such actions would constitute an event of default at the time the covenant is restored. Accordingly, if
such covenant and corresponding event of default are suspended, you will have less credit protection than you will at
the time the notes are issued. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes – Certain Covenants.”

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and/or the guarantees of the_**
**_notes, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the

incurrence of the guarantees of the notes. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state
fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or the guarantees thereof could
be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued the notes or
incurred the guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than
reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantee and,
in the case of (b) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

  - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of
the notes or the incurrence of the guarantee;

  - the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantee left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable,
with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on its business; or

  - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond
our or such guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,

property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that we or any of the
guarantors did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes or incurring its
guarantee to the extent we or such guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the
notes or the incurrence of such guarantee.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we, or any of the

guarantors of the notes, were insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether
the notes or the guarantees of the notes would be subordinated to our or any of such guarantors’ other debt. In
general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if:

  - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable
value of all of its assets;

18


-----

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature;
or

  - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of a guarantee of the notes was a

fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or that guarantee,
subordinate the notes of that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the applicable obligor or
require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee. In the event of a
finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, with respect to the notes or the guarantees thereof, you
may not receive any repayment on the notes.

The Existing Notes Indentures contain, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain,

a “savings clause” intended to limit each subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount
that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under applicable law. There can be no
assurance that this provision will be upheld as intended.

**_A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, or our parent companies_**
**_or the notes, if any, could cause the liquidity or market value of the notes to decline and our cost of capital to_**
**_increase._**

The notes have been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional

rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a
rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment,
circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any
downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of a rating by a rating agency (or any anticipated downgrade, suspension or
withdrawal) could reduce the liquidity or market value of the notes.

Any future lowering of our ratings or the ratings of any of our parent companies, including Holdings, may make

it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to
the notes is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may lose some or all of the value of your
investment.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration under applicable debt_**
**_securities laws._**

We are offering the notes under exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state

securities laws. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, you may only offer or
sell the notes pursuant to an exemption from, or in transactions not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to an effective registration statement. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

**_There is no established trading market for the notes, which means there are uncertainties regarding the price and_**
**_terms on which a holder could dispose of the notes, if at all._**

The notes will constitute new issues of securities with no established trading market. We cannot assure you that

an active trading market will develop for any of the notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able
to resell your notes at their fair market value or at all. Future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors,
including, among other things, our ability to have the restrictive legend removed from the notes, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The initial purchasers have informed us that they
currently intend to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed; however, the initial purchasers are not
obligated to do so, and they may cease their market-making at any time. Although we have applied to list the notes
on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF market, we cannot assure you that a trading
market for the notes will develop, or if a trading market does develop, that it will be maintained.

We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that you

receive when you sell your notes will be favorable. We also cannot assure you as to the level of liquidity of the

19


-----

trading market for the notes if one develops. Future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors,
including:

  - our operating performance and financial condition;

  - the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding;

  - prevailing interest rates;

  - the interest of securities dealers in making a market and the number of available buyers; and

  - the market for similar securities.

You should not purchase any of the notes unless you understand and know you can bear all of the investment

risks involving the notes.

**_You may face currency exchange risks by investing in the notes._**

The notes are denominated and payable in euros. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a

currency other than the currency in which the notes are denominated, investment in such notes entails foreign
currency exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro,
relative to the currency you use to measure your investment returns, caused by economic, political and other factors
which affect exchange rates and over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency in
which you measure your investment returns would cause a decrease in the effective yield of the notes below their
stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the notes is translated into the currency in
which you measure your investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign
currency exchange gains or losses resulting from your investment in the notes. See “U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations.” You should consult your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to you of acquiring, holding
and disposing of the notes.

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies_**
**_within the countries that utilize the euro as an official currency (the “Eurozone”), or the potential dissolution of_**
**_the euro entirely, could adversely affect the value of the notes._**

Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future

financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the
diverse economic and political circumstances in individual member states. These and other concerns could lead to
the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the
possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences
for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential
developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the
notes.

**_In a lawsuit for payment on the notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._**

The notes and the indenture governing the notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Under

New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes would be required to render the judgment
in euros. The judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars, however, at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of
entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors whose home currency is not
euros would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a
significant amount of time. A U.S. federal court sitting in New York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising
in connection with the notes would apply the foregoing New York law. To the extent that a judgment is ordered in
U.S. dollars, an investor would be subject to exchange risk on the amount they receive in euros due to variation in
the exchange rate between the time of judgment and the time of collection. In courts outside of New York, investors
may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an
action based on the notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States
only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euros into U.S. dollars would depend upon
various factors, including which court renders the judgment and when the judgment is rendered.

20


-----

**_Trading in the clearing systems is subject to minimum denomination requirements._**

The notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in

excess thereof. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades which could result in amounts being held
in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive notes are required to be issued in relation
to such notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the
minimum denomination or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in its account with the relevant clearing
system at the relevant time may not receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive notes unless and until such
time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement

**Risks Related to the Collateral**

**_We will in most cases have control over the collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the notes and the related guarantees._**

The collateral documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and

collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees.

In addition, we will not be required to comply with all or any portion of Section 314(d) of the Trust Indenture

Act of 1939 (the “Trust Indenture Act”) if we do not qualify the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby
under the Trust Indenture Act. Because we intend to remove the restrictive legends on the notes, and provide an
unrestricted CUSIP number for the notes, it is likely that we do not file a registration statement relating to the notes
and thus likely that we do not so qualify the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. Section 314(d)
would otherwise have required certain appraisal and valuation actions in connection with certain releases of
collateral under the security arrangements. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes.”

**_There may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the notes._**

No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made in connection with the offering of the notes and the

value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of
buyers and other factors. The fair value of the collateral securing the notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors
that include, among other things, the condition of our industry, the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale,
general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of
the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of
the collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, portions of the collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the
collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or
liquidation of the collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes. In addition, in the event of any
such proceeding, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon any of the collateral may be subject to
bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations.

The notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis with all of our existing and future indebtedness secured

pursuant to the same security arrangements and future indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. As a result,
upon any distribution to our creditors, foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceedings, or following acceleration of our indebtedness or an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders
of the notes, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities will be
entitled to be repaid on an equal and ratable priority basis from the proceeds of collateral.

In addition, the security interest of the collateral agent for the notes will be subject to practical problems

generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent may
need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you
that the collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any
third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Also, certain items included in the
collateral securing the notes, such as licenses and other permits, may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant
to applicable law) and therefore the collateral agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of
a foreclosure. Accordingly, the collateral agent, as collateral agent for the notes, may not have the ability to
foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral securing the notes may significantly decrease.

21


-----

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the collateral securing the_**
**_notes and related guarantees will be released automatically, without the consent of the holders of the notes or the_**
**_trustee._**

Under various circumstances, collateral securing the notes will be released automatically, including:

  - a sale, transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the Existing Notes
Indentures or the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities;

  - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee; and

  - with respect to collateral that is capital stock, upon the dissolution of the issuer of such capital stock in
accordance with the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.

In addition, the guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released in connection with a sale of

such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the Existing Notes Indentures and the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby.

The Existing Notes Indentures do, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will, also permit

us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted
subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture that
will govern the notes offered hereby, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its
subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the
indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the
aggregate value of the collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary
and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have
a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries. See “Description of Senior Secured
Notes.”

**_The security agreement in respect of the collateral securing the notes limits the ability of the trustee for the notes_**
**_to take or direct enforcement actions with respect to such collateral._**

The security agreement in respect of the collateral securing the notes will provide that only the “Applicable

Authorized Representative” has the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the collateral,
including directing its release, and the representatives of other series of obligations secured pursuant to the security
agreement have no right to take actions with respect to the collateral. See “Description of Senior Secured Notes—
Collateral and Intercreditor Arrangements—Intercreditor Provisions.”

Certain categories of assets will be excluded from the collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees.

Excluded assets will include the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and equity investees, certain capital stock
of our subsidiaries and equity investees and certain properties and motor vehicles. If an event of default occurs and
the notes are accelerated, the notes and the related guarantees will rank equally with the holders of other
unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the relevant entity with respect to such excluded property.

**_The rights of holders of the notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in certain collateral in the future._**

Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest,

such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such
property and rights are acquired and identified. The security agreement in respect of the collateral securing the notes
will not require us to take certain actions to perfect the security interests granted thereunder including entering into
any control agreements. In addition, the trustee and collateral agent may not monitor, or we may not inform the
trustee and collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and necessary
action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The collateral agent
for the notes will have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute
collateral or the perfection of any security interest in favor of the notes against third parties. Such failure may result
in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes against third
parties.

22


-----

**_Delivery of security interests in collateral acquired after the issue date of the notes increases the risk that the_**
**_security interests in respect of such collateral could be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

The delivery of security interests in any after-acquired collateral will be made after the issue date of the notes. If

the grantor of any such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any mortgage or
security interest in collateral delivered by such grantor after the issue date of the notes would face a greater risk than
security interests in place on the issue date of being voidable as a preference under bankruptcy law by the pledgor
(as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties, if certain events or circumstances exist
or occur, including if the pledge is deemed a fraudulent conveyance or the person pledging or granting such security
interest is insolvent at the time of the pledge or grant of the security interest, if the pledge or security interest permits
the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery than if the security interest had not been pledged or granted and
a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or grant, or, in
certain circumstances, a longer period. To the extent that any such grant or pledge is avoided as a preference, you
would lose the benefit of the security interest in the applicable collateral.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for

our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in
whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss
of any of the pledged collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations,
including the notes and the related guarantees.

**_State law may limit the ability of the trustee and the holders of the notes to foreclose on real property and_**
**_improvements included in the collateral._**

The notes will be secured by, among other things, liens on real property and related improvements located in

various states. State laws may limit the ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the improved real property
collateral located therein. State laws govern the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against
real property which secure debt obligations such as the notes. These laws may impose procedural requirements for
foreclosure that differ from, and may necessitate a longer time period for completion than, the requirements for
foreclosure of security interests in personal property. Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if
it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts, and a right of redemption after
foreclosure. The laws of certain states may also impose “security first” or “single action” rules, which limit the type
or number of judicial remedies that a creditor may seek in respect of defaults on mortgaged property, and which
might affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless of
the location of the collateral and limit the right to recover any deficiency following a foreclosure.

The holders of the notes, the trustee and the collateral agent for the notes may also be limited in their ability to

seek remedies in the event of a breach of the covenant described under “Description of Senior Secured Notes—
Certain Covenants.” Judicial decisions in some jurisdictions have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate
debt as a result of a breach of similar covenants. Under these decisions, a lender seeking to accelerate debt secured
by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens may be required to
demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to
protect against an increased risk of default. Although federal law may preempt, in whole or in part, certain of these
decisions, the scope of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, courts in certain jurisdictions could
prevent the collateral agent from exercising all the remedies available to it pursuant to the indenture that will govern
the notes offered hereby upon a breach of this covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of
holders to enforce the covenant.

**_In the event of our bankruptcy, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon the collateral will be subject_**
**_to certain bankruptcy law and other limitations._**

The ability of holders of the notes to realize upon the collateral will be subject to certain bankruptcy law

limitations in the event of our bankruptcy. Under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, secured creditors are
prohibited from repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case without bankruptcy court approval
and may be prohibited from disposing of security repossessed from such a debtor without bankruptcy court
approval. Moreover, applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally permit the debtor to continue to retain collateral,

23


-----

including cash collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that
the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.”

The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but is intended

generally to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral with the commencement of the
bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional security if and at such times as the
court, in its discretion, determines that a diminution in the value of the collateral occurs as a result of the stay of
repossession or the disposition of the collateral during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a
precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court,
we cannot predict whether or when the collateral agent for the notes could foreclose upon or sell the collateral or
whether or to what extent holders of notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the
collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.”

Moreover, the collateral agent may need to evaluate the impact of the potential liabilities before determining to

foreclose on collateral consisting of real property, if any, because secured creditors that hold a security interest in
real property may be held liable under environmental laws for the costs of remediating or preventing the release or
threatened releases of hazardous substances at such real property. Consequently, the collateral agent may decline to
foreclose on such collateral or exercise remedies available in respect thereof if it does not receive indemnification to
its satisfaction from the holders of the notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from this offering will be approximately €445 million. We intend to use the

net proceeds of the offering of the notes, together with available cash, to redeem the 3.625% Notes pursuant to the
Notice of Redemption and to pay premiums, fees, expenses and accrued interest related to such redemption and the
offering of the notes. We cannot assure you that the Transactions will be consummated in accordance with their
terms, or at all. Should the offering of notes not be consummated or should the aggregate principal amount of newly
issued notes be less than €445 million, some portion of the 3.625% Notes may remain outstanding. Certain of the
initial purchasers and/or affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may hold positions in the 3.625% Notes and,
accordingly, may receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering.

The outstanding principal amount of the 3.625% Notes is €445,000,000. The 3.625% Notes mature on October

15, 2026.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and equivalents and capitalization of Parent:

  - as of June 30, 2021, on an actual basis; and

  - as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions as if they had been completed on June 30, 2021.

The total capitalization of Warner Music Group is substantially similar to that of Parent. Debt amounts

presented in the table below reflect the aggregate outstanding principal amounts. The Issuer’s authorized and
outstanding share capital consists of 1,001 shares of common stock, par value $0.001. All outstanding shares of
common stock of the Issuer are fully paid and non-assessable, and owned 100% by Holdings.

After giving effect to the Transactions, actual amounts may vary from the estimated as adjusted amounts

depending on several factors, including differences from our estimate of fees and expenses. We intend to use the net
proceeds of this offering, together with available cash, to redeem the 3.625% Notes and to pay certain other related
fees and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.” We cannot assure you that the Transactions will be consummated in
accordance with their terms, or at all.

This table should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Risk Factors,” and “Listing Circular

Summary—Recent Developments” sections included or incorporated by reference in this listing circular and the
interim unaudited financial statements of Parent as of June 30, 2021 and for the three month periods ended June 30,
2021 and 2020, incorporated by reference into this listing circular.

**DESCRIPTION OF SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading “—Certain

Definitions.” In this description, the term “Issuer” refers only to WMG Acquisition Corp. and not to any of its
subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue its euro-denominated 2.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “Offered Notes”) under

an indenture (the “Base Indenture”), dated as of June 29, 2020 (the “Base Indenture Closing Date”) among itself, as
issuer, the Guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and Credit Suisse AG, as
Notes Authorized Agent and Collateral Agent, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture thereto, to be
dated as of the issue date of the Offered Notes (the “Closing Date”) (the Base Indenture as supplemented, the
“Indenture”) in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer previously issued $535.0 million principal amount of 3.875% Senior Secured
Notes due 2030 (the “Initial Dollar Notes”), €325.0 million principal amount of 2.750% Senior Secured Notes due
2028 (the “Initial Euro Notes” and, together with the Initial Dollar Notes, the “Initial Notes”), $550.0 million
principal amount of 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “3.000% Notes”) and $250.0 million principal
amount of 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the “Additional 3.000% Notes” and, together with the Initial
Notes and the 3.000% Notes, the “Existing Notes”) under the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the first and
second supplemental indentures thereto, on June 29, 2020, the third supplemental indenture thereto, on August 12,
2020, and the fourth supplemental indenture thereto, on November 2, 2020. The Offered Notes and any Additional
Notes (as defined below) are referred to collectively in this “Description of Senior Secured Notes” as the “Notes”
and references to “Issue Date” are to November 1, 2012, the issue date of the initial notes issued under the
Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2012 (the “2012 Secured Indenture”), among the Issuer, as issuer, the
Guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, and Credit Suisse AG, as Notes Authorized Agent
and Collateral Agent. The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended
(the “Trust Indenture Act”). We cannot assure you that any of the Transactions will be consummated in accordance
with their terms, or at all.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Offered Notes and the

Security Documents. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read those documents
because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Offered Notes. Copies of the Indenture,
the Offered Notes and the Security Documents may be obtained from the Issuer upon request. Certain defined terms
used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in
the Indenture, the Offered Notes and the Security Documents.

The registered Holder of any Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders

will have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Offered Notes and the Guarantees**

The Offered Notes:

  - will be general obligations of the Issuer;

  - will be secured on an equal basis with all existing and future Obligations of the Issuer having Pari Passu
Lien Priority, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, by first-priority Liens (subject
to Permitted Liens) on the Collateral from time to time owned by the Issuer;

  - will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

  - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer,
including the Existing Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities;

  - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (other than
certain intercompany obligations) of any non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

27


-----

  - will not be guaranteed by Holdings (the principal asset of which, other than cash on hand from time to time,
is the shares of the Issuer).

The Guarantees in respect of the Offered Notes:

  - will be general obligations of such Guarantor;

  - will be secured on an equal basis with all existing and future Obligations of such Guarantor having Pari
Passu Lien Priority, including such Guarantor’s guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing
Notes, by first-priority Liens (subject to Permitted Liens) on the Collateral from time to time owned by
such Guarantor;

  - will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

  - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including its guarantee of the Existing Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities; and

  - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities (other than
certain intercompany obligations) of any Subsidiary of such Guarantor that is not also a Guarantor of the
Offered Notes.

As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Offered Notes Transactions:

  - the Offered Notes and related Guarantees would have been secured on an equal basis with approximately
$3,367 million of total consolidated indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors represented by
indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes and the Offered Notes;

  - the Offered Notes and related Guarantees would have been structurally subordinated to approximately
$1,978 million of liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries; and

  - we would have had $290 million in unutilized revolving capacity under the Senior Credit Facilities (after
giving effect to approximately $10 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Senior Revolving
Credit Facility as of June 30, 2021), which would be pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and
would be secured on an equal basis with the Notes.

The Indenture permits us to incur additional secured Indebtedness, including additional Indebtedness secured by

the Collateral.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Offered Notes will be issued initially in an aggregate principal amount of €445 million. The Initial Dollar

Notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $535 million, the Initial Euro Notes were issued in an
aggregate principal amount of €325 million, the 3.000% Notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $550
million and the Additional 3.000% Notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. In addition
to the Existing Notes, additional securities may be issued under the Indenture in one or more series (the “Additional
_Notes”) from time to time after this offering. Any offering of Additional Notes is subject to the covenants described_
below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Any Additional Notes issued under the Indenture will vote
as a single class with the Offered Notes (except as otherwise provided herein) and will otherwise be treated as Notes
for purposes of the Indenture. The Indenture permits the Issuer to designate the currency, maturity date, interest rate
and optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of Additional Notes, which may differ from the
maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions applicable to the Existing Notes of any series and the
Offered Notes issued on the Closing Date. Additional Notes that differ with respect to currency, maturity date,
interest rate or optional redemption provisions from the Existing Notes of any series or the Offered Notes issued on
the Closing Date will constitute a different series of Notes from such Existing Notes or Offered Notes, as applicable.
Additional Notes that have the same currency, maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions as the
Existing Notes or the Offered Notes issued on the Closing Date will be treated as the same series as such Existing
Notes or Offered Notes, as applicable, unless otherwise designated by the Issuer. The Issuer will similarly be

28


-----

entitled to vary the application of certain other provisions to any series of Additional Notes. A separate CUSIP or
ISIN would be issued for any Additional Notes, unless the Existing Notes of any series or the Offered Notes, as
applicable, and such Additional Notes are treated as part of the “same issue” for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
or both the Existing Notes of any series and the Offered Notes, as applicable, and such Additional Notes are issued
in the same series without (or with less than a de minimis amount of) original issue discount for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, or another then-recognized identifier is used. The Issuer will issue Offered Notes in denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Offered Notes will mature on August 15, 2031 (the
“Offered Notes Final Maturity Date”).

Interest on the Offered Notes will accrue at the rate of 2.250% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in

arrears on February 15 and August 15, commencing on February 15, 2022. The Issuer will make each interest
payment to the Holders of record of the Offered Notes on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1,
whether or not a business day.

Interest on the Offered Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid,

from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

If a Holder has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuer, the Issuer, through the paying agent for the Offered

Notes, or otherwise, will pay all principal, interest and premium, if any, on that Holder’s Offered Notes in
accordance with those instructions. All other payments on the Offered Notes will be made at the office or agency of
the paying agent and registrar (initially within the City of Luxembourg), unless the Issuer elects to make interest
payments by check mailed to the Holders at their address set forth in the register of Holders or otherwise.

**Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) if and for so long as the Offered Notes are

listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market.
The Registrars will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Offered Notes (as defined herein) outstanding from
time to time (the “Register”) and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Offered Notes on behalf of the
Issuer. The Issuer will also maintain a register of Offered Notes at its registered office which, in case of any
discrepancy with the information contained in the Register, shall prevail over the Register.

Société Générale Bank & Trust will initially act as paying agent, transfer agent and Registrar of the Offered

Notes. The Issuer may change the paying agent, transfer agent or Registrar of the Offered Notes, without prior
notice to the Holders, and the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent, transfer agent or Registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the procedures described in

“Book Entry, Delivery and Form” and “Transfer Restrictions.” The Registrars and the Trustee may require a Holder,
among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuer may require a Holder
to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or
exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note (1) for
a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or (2) tendered and not withdrawn in connection with
a Change of Control Offer.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to August 15, 2026 the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the

aggregate principal amount of Offered Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any Additional Notes of
the same series) issued under the Indenture, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 102.250% of the principal
amount of the Offered Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of redemption
(subject to the rights of Holders of Offered Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date) (each, a “Offered Note Equity Offering Redemption”), with funds in an aggregate amount not
exceeding the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Issuer or any contribution to the Issuer’s

29


-----

common equity capital made with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Issuer’s direct or
indirect parent; provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Offered Notes originally issued under the Indenture

(including the aggregate principal amount of any Additional Notes of the same series) remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (unless all Offered Notes are otherwise repurchased or
redeemed substantially concurrently with the corresponding Offered Note Equity Offering Redemption); and

(2) notice of such redemption is given no more than 180 days after the date of, and may be conditioned

upon, the closing of such Equity Offering.

The Offered Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to August 15, 2026 at the option of

the Issuer, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Offered Notes redeemed plus the
Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

On or after August 15, 2026 the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Offered Notes, at its option, at the

redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, on the Offered Notes to be redeemed to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the
twelve-month period beginning on August 15 of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2026........................................................................................................................................ 101.125%

2027........................................................................................................................................ 100.563%

2028 and thereafter ................................................................................................................. 100.000%

In addition, during any 12-month period prior to August 15, 2026 the Issuer will be entitled to redeem up to

10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Offered Notes (including the principal amount of any
Additional Notes of the same series) at a redemption price equal to 101.125% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

The Issuer may acquire Offered Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market

purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such
acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.

The Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and performance of

the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

Any redemption or notice of any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more

conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering, other offering or other
corporate transaction or event. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. Notice of any redemption in
respect of an Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender for Offered Notes, if Holders of not less than 90%

in the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Offered Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Offered
Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any other Person making such tender offer, purchases all of the Offered
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer will have the right, upon notice given not
more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to such tender offer, to redeem all of the Offered Notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to the price offered to each Holder in such
tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest to but

30


-----

excluding the date of redemption (subject to the rights of Holders of Offered Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Offered Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Offered Notes for

redemption as follows:

(1) if the Offered Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the

requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the Offered Notes are listed; or

(2) if the Offered Notes are not listed on any national securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by

such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate, or in accordance with Euroclear’s or Clearstream’s
procedures, as applicable.

No Offered Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. If a partial redemption is made with the proceeds

of an Equity Offering in accordance with the first paragraph under “—Optional Redemption,” the Trustee will select
the applicable Offered Notes on a pro rata basis or on as nearly a pro rata basis as is practicable (subject to
Euroclear’s or Clearstream’s procedures, as applicable, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock
exchange or depositary requirements). Notices of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail or delivered by
electronic transmission at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Offered
Notes to be redeemed, except that redemption notices may be mailed or delivered by electronic transmission more
than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Offered Notes,
a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or a satisfaction and discharge of any Notes of a series.

If any Offered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Offered Note

will state the portion of the principal amount of that Offered Note that is to be redeemed. A new certificated Offered
Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original certificated Offered Note will be issued in
the name of the Holder of Offered Notes upon cancellation of the original certificated Offered Note. Offered Notes
called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases
to accrue on certificated Offered Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Guarantees**

The Indenture provides that the Guarantors jointly and severally guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the

Indenture and the Notes on a senior secured basis. The Indenture provides that the obligations of each Guarantor
under its Guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer under applicable law.

Each Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to the Issuer or another Restricted

Subsidiary without limitation, or with other Persons upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. The
Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released in the event that:

(1) the sale, disposition or other transfer (including through merger or consolidation) of all of the Capital

Stock (or any sale, disposition or other transfer of Capital Stock or other transaction following which the
applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary), or all or substantially all the assets, of the applicable
Guarantor if such sale, disposition or other transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture;

(2) the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in

accordance with the provisions of the Indenture set forth in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

(3) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness under the

Senior Term Loan Agreement or Senior Revolving Credit Agreement, or the guarantee that resulted in the
obligation of such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes;

31


-----

(4) the exercise of the legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option by the Issuer as described

under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture being
discharged in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(5) during the Suspension Period, upon the merger or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into

another Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor with such other Subsidiary being the surviving Person in such merger
or consolidation, or upon liquidation of such Guarantor following the transfer of all of its assets to the Issuer or
a Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor.

**Collateral and Intercreditor Arrangements**

**Collateral**

The Security Documents provide that the Notes and the Guarantees have the benefit of the Collateral, which

generally consists of the Capital Stock of the Issuer and substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, including pledges of all Capital Stock of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries directly
owned by the Issuer and the Guarantors (but limited to 65% of each series of Capital Stock of each direct Foreign
Subsidiary owned by the Issuer or any Guarantor), subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, and excluding any
Excluded Assets and Excluded Subsidiary Securities. The Security Documents provide that the Collateral of the
Issuer and Holdings secures the Obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, and Collateral of each Guarantor secures
the Obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee.

Not all assets of Holdings, the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries constitutes Collateral. See “Risk Factors—

Risk Factors Related to the Collateral—The security agreement in respect of the collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes will limit the ability of the trustee for the Senior Secured Notes to take or direct enforcement actions
with respect to such collateral.” The Security Documents provide that the Collateral that secures the Notes excludes
the Excluded Assets.

“Excluded Assets” is defined in the Security Documents, and includes among other things:

(1) certain property that is subject to a Lien in respect of purchase money obligations or Capitalized

Lease Obligations,

(2) any fee interest in real property owned as of the Issue Date, and any fee interest in after-acquired

owned real property if, in each case, the fair market value of such fee interest is less than $5.0 million
individually,

(3) motor vehicles and any other assets subject to certificate of title, (iv) property that has been sold or

otherwise transferred in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing, (v) any interest in leased real
property, (vi) certain assets being held for pending divestiture in connection with an acquisition that (in the
good faith determination of the Issuer) would not be material to the business or operations of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries and (vii) foreign intellectual property. The Security Documents provide that the Collateral also
excludes any Excluded Subsidiary Securities. In addition, the Security Documents do not require the Issuer and
the Guarantors to (x) take any action in any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, or required by
the laws of any such jurisdiction, in order to create any security interests (or other Liens) in assets located or
titled outside of the United States of America or to perfect any security interests (or other Liens) in any
Collateral, (y) deliver control agreements with respect to, or confer perfection by “control” over, any deposit
accounts, bank or securities account or other Collateral, except, in the case of Collateral that constitutes Capital
Stock or intercompany notes in certificated form, delivering such Capital Stock or intercompany notes (in the
case of intercompany notes, limited to any such note with a principal amount in excess of $5.0 million) to the
Collateral Agent (or another Person as required under the Security Agreement) or (z) deliver landlord lien
waivers, estoppels or collateral access letters.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could be secured

by Liens sharing in all or part of the Collateral, which security interests may rank equally with or junior to the
security interest of the Holders of the Notes. The amount of all such additional secured Indebtedness will be limited
by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Under certain circumstances the amount of such
additional secured Indebtedness could be significant.

32


-----

The Security Agreement provides that Holders of the Notes have a security interest ranking equal with the

security interest of the holders of the Existing Notes, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and certain
Additional Pari Passu Obligations (each as defined under “Intercreditor Provisions” below). Except as provided
therein, the Security Agreement does not permit Holders of the Notes to take any enforcement action with respect to
the Collateral without the written consent of the Applicable Authorized Representative (as defined under
“Intercreditor Provisions” below). See “Intercreditor Provisions.”

**After Acquired Property**

Promptly, but in no event later than 180 days, following the acquisition by the Issuer or any Guarantor of any

After Acquired Property, the Issuer or such Guarantor shall execute and deliver such mortgages, Security Document
supplements, security instruments and financing statements as shall be reasonably necessary to cause such After
Acquired Property to be made subject to a perfected Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) in favor of the Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes (as well as for the benefit of the holders of Existing
Notes, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and certain Additional Obligations), and thereupon all
provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such
After Acquired Property to the same extent and with the same force and effect, provided that (a) the Collateral in
any event will exclude Excluded Assets and Excluded Subsidiary Securities and (b) in any event the Issuer or such
Guarantor will not be required to (x) take any action in any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, or
required by the laws of any such jurisdiction, in order to create any security interests (or other Liens) in assets
located or titled outside of the United States of America or to perfect any security interests (or other Liens) in any
Collateral, (y) deliver control agreements with respect to, or confer perfection by “control” over, any deposit
accounts, bank or securities account or other Collateral, except, in the case of Collateral that constitutes Capital
Stock or intercompany notes in certificated form, delivering such Capital Stock or intercompany notes (in the case
of intercompany notes, limited to any such note with a principal amount in excess of $5.0 million) to the Collateral
Agent (or another Person as required under the Security Agreement) or (z) deliver landlord lien waivers, estoppels
or collateral access letters.

**Security Documents**

The Issuer, Holdings, the Guarantors, the Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative for the Term Loan

Obligations, the Authorized Representative for the Revolving Obligations and the Indenture Authorized
Representative (each as defined below) are parties to the Security Agreement which, together with any other
Security Documents, create and establish the terms of the Liens that secure the Notes and the Guarantees. These
Liens secure the payment when due of all of the Notes Obligations, as provided in the Security Documents. Credit
Suisse AG has been appointed, pursuant to the Indenture, as the Indenture Authorized Representative.

Although the Holders of the Offered Notes will not be party to the Security Agreement, by their acceptance of

the Offered Notes they will agree to be bound thereby.

**lntercreditor Provisions**

The Security Agreement sets forth certain intercreditor arrangements (the “Intercreditor Provisions”) among the

holders of the Notes (as well as for the benefit of the holders of Existing Notes), the holders of certain obligations
under the Senior Term Loan Agreement, certain designated hedging obligations and certain designated cash
management arrangements (collectively, as more particularly defined in the Security Agreement, the “Term Loan
Obligations”), the holders of certain obligations under the Senior Revolving Credit Agreement, certain designated
hedging obligations and certain designated cash management arrangements (collectively, as more particularly
defined in the Security Agreement, the “Revolving Obligations”) and the holders of certain additional pari passu
obligations (the “Additional Pari Passu Obligations” and collectively with the Notes Obligations, the Term Loan
Obligations and Revolving Obligations, the “First Lien Obligations”). Term Loan Obligations and Revolving
Obligations are defined in the Security Agreement and include successor credit agreements, loan agreements or
other agreements or instruments evidencing or governing the terms of any indebtedness incurred to refund,
refinance, restructure, replace, renew, repay, increase or extend (whether in whole or in part and whether with the
original agent and creditors or other agents and creditors or otherwise) the indebtedness and other obligations
outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Agreement or the Senior Revolving Credit Agreement, as the case may be,
to the extent designated by Holdings pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement. Each series of First Lien
Obligations under the Security Agreement is represented by the Trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent or
other debt representative for such series of First Lien Obligations (each, an “Authorized Representative”) and Credit

33


-----

Suisse AG acts as initial Authorized Representative for the Term Loan Obligations, as initial Authorized
Representative for the Revolving Obligations and as initial Authorized Representative for the Notes Obligations.
The Intercreditor Provisions set forth certain rights, priorities and interests of the holders of the Notes Obligations,
Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and Additional Pari Passu Obligations. The Intercreditor Provisions
provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the holders of First Lien Obligations, including, among
other things, that:

(1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any

Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and
Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Liens securing all such series of First Lien Obligations shall be of equal
priority;

(2) each series of First Lien Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated,

supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended from time to time as permitted by the
Indenture and the other agreements governing the other First Lien Obligations without affecting the Lien
priority or relative rights of the holders of First Lien Obligations under the Security Documents; and

(3) so long as permitted by the Indenture and the agreements governing the Term Loan Obligations, the

Revolving Obligations and any permitted Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Issuer may incur additional
Additional Pari Passu Obligations, which may be secured equally and ratably with each other series of First
Lien Obligations on the terms and conditions set forth in the Security Agreement.

The Intercreditor Provisions also provide that, subject to limited exceptions, only the “Applicable Authorized

Representative” has the right to exercise remedies (including to direct foreclosures and take other actions with
respect to the Collateral), and the Authorized Representatives of other series of First Lien Obligations have no right
to take actions with respect to the Collateral. As of the Closing Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will
be Credit Suisse AG as Authorized Representative for the Revolving Obligations and Credit Suisse AG, as
Authorized Representative on behalf of the holders of the Notes, will have no rights to take any action under the
Intercreditor Provisions. The “Applicable Authorized Representative” as of any date is:

(1) to the extent one or more revolving credit facilities with commitments equal to, or in excess of, $75.0

million (each, a “Major Revolving Facility”) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Revolving Facility (a “Revolver
Replacement Event”), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility (or, if more
than one Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with respect to
the Major Revolving Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments thereunder);
_provided that upon the occurrence of a Revolver Replacement Event with respect to the Major Revolving_
Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable
Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility
with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments;

(2) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement

Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving
Facility and (y) one or more term loan facilities with Indebtedness outstanding, equal to, in excess of, $75.0
million (each, a “Major Term Loan Facility”) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Term Loan Facility (a “Term
Loan Replacement Event”), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility (or, if
more than one Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with
respect to the Major Term Loan Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness);
_provided that upon the occurrence of a Term Loan Replacement Event with respect to the Major Term Loan_
Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable
Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility
with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness; and

(3) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement

Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving
Facility and (y) no Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date or a Term Loan Replacement Event

34


-----

has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Term Loan Facility,
until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable series of
First Lien Obligations (a “First Lien Facility Replacement Event”), the Authorized Representative with respect
to the series of First Lien Obligations with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or
Indebtedness; provided that upon the occurrence of a First Lien Facility Replacement Event with respect to the
series of First Lien Obligations whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative,
the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the series of
First Lien Obligations with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or Indebtedness.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date,” with respect to the then Applicable

Authorized Representative and with respect to any series of First Lien Obligation that is not represented by the then
Applicable Authorized Representative, is the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period the Authorized
Representative of such series of First Lien Obligation was a Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative)
after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing the series of First Lien
Obligations under which such Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative,
and (b) the Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that
Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is a Major Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing that series of First Lien
Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and
payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise), in accordance with the agreements
governing that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative
Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any
Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Collateral Agent has commenced and is
pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral with reasonable diligence in light of the then
existing circumstances or (2) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such
Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any bankruptcy, insolvency or
liquidation proceeding.

“Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means the Authorized Representative of any series of First

Lien Obligations with principal amount of Indebtedness or commitments thereunder equal to, or in excess of, $75
million, that is not represented by the then Applicable Authorized Representative.

The Applicable Authorized Representative has the sole right to instruct the Collateral Agent to act or refrain

from acting with respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to
such Collateral from any other Person. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other
than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official
appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to,
or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in
respect of, the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the

Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative
had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other
than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest, or object to any foreclosure proceeding or
action brought by the Collateral Agent or Applicable Authorized Representative. Each Authorized Representative
agrees that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the applicable
series of First Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Notes or the
applicable First Lien Obligations) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each holder of the First Lien
Obligations, including the holders of the Offered Notes by acceptance thereof, is deemed to have agreed that it will
not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any Proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of
First Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the Intercreditor Provisions.

If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the agreements governing a series of First Lien

Obligations, and the Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any
distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the

35


-----

proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Collateral Agent or any other
holder of First Lien Obligations, as applicable, is required to be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the
payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral
Agent.

Holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or

other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations seeking
damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any
Collateral. In addition, holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof
marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of First Lien Obligations
obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the
discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for
the other holders of First Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the
Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Security Agreement.

By agreeing to purchase Offered Notes, each noteholder authorizes the Trustee and the Indenture Authorized

Representative (1) (in the case of the Trustee) to appoint the Indenture Authorized Representative to act on its behalf
as the Indenture Authorized Representative under the Security Agreement, (2) to appoint the Collateral Agent to act
on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement and under each of the other Security Documents
and (3) to authorize the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Security Documents,
including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any grantor
thereunder to secure any of the First Lien Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto.

The Security Agreement provides that the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those

expressly set forth therein and in the other Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Collateral Agent:

(1) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default

has occurred and is continuing;

(2) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except

discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Agreement or by the other Security
Documents that the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized
Representative; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any
Security Document or applicable law;

(3) shall not, except as expressly set forth in Security Agreement and in the other Security Documents,

have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a grantor
or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any
capacity;

(4) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) with the consent or at the request of the

Applicable Authorized Representative or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or
(3) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Issuer stating that such action is permitted by the
terms of the Security Agreement; and

(5) shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under, and as defined in, any series of

First Lien Obligations unless and until written notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Collateral
Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First Lien Obligations or the Issuer.

In addition, among other things, the Collateral Agent will not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or

inquire into (1) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with the Security Agreement or
any other Security Document, (2) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under the
Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (3) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,

36


-----

agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, or the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (4) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of the
Security Agreement, any other Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation,
perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Security Documents, (5) the value or the sufficiency
of any Collateral for any series of First Lien Obligations or (6) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any
agreement relating to the First Lien Obligations, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Collateral Agent.

**Additional Intercreditor Arrangements**

By their acceptance of the Offered Notes, the Holders of the Offered Notes will authorize the Collateral Agent,

the Indenture Authorized Representative and the Trustee, as applicable, to enter into any intercreditor agreement on
behalf of, and binding with respect to, the Holders of the Offered Notes and their interest in designated assets, in
connection with the incurrence of any Additional Indebtedness, including to clarify the respective rights of all
parties in and to designated assets. The Collateral Agent or the Indenture Authorized Representative, as applicable,
will enter into any such intercreditor agreement at the request of the Issuer, provided that the Issuer will have
delivered to the Collateral Agent or the Indenture Authorized Representative, as the case may be, an Officer’s
Certificate to the effect that such other intercreditor agreement complies with the provisions of the Indenture and the
Security Documents.

The Issuer will have the right to determine whether Obligations with respect to Additional Indebtedness

(“Additional Obligations”) will, as between such Additional Obligations and the Note Obligations, rank pari passu
or junior with respect to the Collateral, and as between or among such Additional Obligations and any other First
Lien Obligations, rank pari passu, senior or junior with respect to the Collateral, to the extent permitted under the
applicable Security Documents. The terms on which any Additional Obligations will rank junior in priority to the
Note Obligations and other First Lien Obligations with respect to the Collateral will be set forth in one or more other
intercreditor agreements having terms no less favorable to the Holders with respect to such Collateral than the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, as determined in good faith by the Issuer.

**Release of Collateral**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to the releases of property and other assets included in the

Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances:

  - to enable the disposition of such property or assets to any Person (other than the Issuer or a Guarantor);

  - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee (including upon (A) satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture as set forth below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or (B) a legal defeasance or
covenant defeasance as set forth below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”), the release
of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

  - with respect to Collateral that is Equity Interests, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of that
Equity Interest that is not prohibited by the Indenture;

  - if the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and the Issuer has delivered a
notice of such Investment Grade Ratings to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent and no Default has
occurred and is continuing under the Indenture;

  - the release of Collateral by the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized
Representative in accordance with the terms of the Security Agreement (other than releases of all or
substantially all of the Collateral);

  - in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Security Documents; or

  - as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The Offered Notes and Guarantees will cease to have a security interest in the Collateral upon (i) payment in

full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Offered Notes and all other Obligations

37


-----

with respect to the Offered Notes under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and
payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is paid or (ii) a legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance” or a discharge of the Indenture or the Offered Notes as described under “—Satisfaction and
Discharge.”

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Notes after the Closing Date, unless the

Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” (and has not
rescinded such exercise), each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part
(equal to €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of Offered Notes and other Eurodenominated Notes) of that Holder’s Notes pursuant to an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms set forth
in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment (a “Change of Control Payment”) in
cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase. On or prior to the date that is 30 days following any Change of
Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will mail or deliver by electronic transmission a notice to each Holder stating
that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and offering to repurchase Offered Notes on
the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later
than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture
and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Indenture by virtue of
such conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control

Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all

Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s

Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer.

The paying agents will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control

Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or applicable authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or
cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or
an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Offered Notes and other Euro-denominated Notes.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change

of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable.
Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance

of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering

38


-----

Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is
made.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event

if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all
Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Offered Notes validly tender

and do not withdraw such Offered Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a
Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of such Offered Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to such Change
of Control Offer, to redeem all Offered Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash
equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of such
redemption (subject to the rights of Holders of such Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the
relevant interest payment date).

Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions of certain events that would

constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a
Change of Control Triggering Event. Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Issuer may prohibit the Issuer from
repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event unless such Indebtedness has been repurchased
or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of those
creditors accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could
cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of
such repurchase on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes
upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The provisions under the
Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Notes. As described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer also has the right to redeem
the Offered Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or otherwise.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of
control.”

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance of

“all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there
is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in
ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether the Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the

Closing Date, (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has
occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the date thereof being referred to as the
“Suspension Date”) then, the covenants listed under the following captions in this “Description of Senior Secured
Notes” section of this listing circular will not be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) clause (5) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”; and

(2) “—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees,”

39


-----

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the

Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one
or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the
Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be
subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between
the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this “Description of Senior Secured Notes” as the
“Suspension Period.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of

any kind will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Subsidiary to comply
with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period (or upon termination of the Suspension Period or after
that time arising out of actions taken or events that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a
Reversion Date the Issuer and any Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default, Event of Default or
breach of any kind, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising
prior to such Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, and shall have no liability
for any actions taken or events that occurred during the Suspension Period, or for any actions taken or events
occurring at any time pursuant to any such commitment or obligation.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

**Liens**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to

exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness of the Issuer or of a
Guarantor, on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or on any
right to receive income therefrom (the “Initial Lien”), unless (a) in the case of an Initial Lien on any Collateral, such
Initial Lien has Junior Lien Priority on such Collateral in relation to the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable or
(b) in the case of an Initial Lien on any other asset or property, the Notes (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are equally and ratably secured with (or, in the event the Lien relates to Subordinated Indebtedness, are
secured on a senior basis to) the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a
Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be

automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien that
gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

The Issuer may not (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer is the

surviving Person); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties
or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions to another Person
(including pursuant to a Division); unless:

(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such

consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition has been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state
of the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof (the Issuer or such Person, as the case may
be, being herein called the “Successor Company”);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the

Notes and the Indenture pursuant to agreements in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) [reserved]; and

40


-----

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall have by

supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes;

_provided that, for the purposes of this covenant only, neither a Music Publishing Sale nor a Recorded Music Sale_
will be deemed to be a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) the Issuer may
therefore consummate a Music Publishing Sale without complying with this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
Assets” covenant notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”
covenant, (2) the Issuer may therefore consummate a Recorded Music Sale without complying with this “Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Merger, Consolidation
or Sale of Assets” covenant and (3) the determination in the preceding proviso shall not affect the determination of
what constitutes all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer under any other contract to which the Issuer is a party.

For the purpose of this covenant, with respect to any sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of

properties or assets in connection with any acquisition (including any acquisition by means of a merger or
consolidation with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary), the determination of whether such sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or disposition constitutes a sale of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole shall be made on a pro forma basis giving effect to such acquisition.

This “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer,

conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (3), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer
all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or to another Restricted Subsidiary and (b) the Issuer may merge
with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in another state of the United
States.

Any reference herein to (i) a transfer, assignment, sale, disposition or transfer, or similar term, shall be deemed

to apply to a division of or by a limited liability company, or an allocation of assets to a series of a limited liability
company (collectively, a “Division”), as if it were a transfer, assignment, sale or transfer, or similar term, as
applicable, to a separate Person, and (ii) a merger, consolidation, amalgamation or consolidation, or similar term,
shall be deemed to apply to the division of or by a limited liability company, or an allocation of assets to a series of a
limited liability company, or the unwinding of such a division or allocation, as if it were a merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or consolidation or similar term, as applicable, with a separate Person.

**Additional Subsidiary Guarantees**

The Indenture provides that the Issuer will cause each Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary that is a Domestic

Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is a Securitization Subsidiary) that guarantees any Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Guarantor under the Senior Term Loan Agreement or Senior Revolving Credit Agreement to execute and
deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the
Notes. Each Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by
that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted Subsidiary, voidable
under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally.

Each Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—

Guarantees.”

**Reports**

The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee and the Holders of Notes, as their names and addresses appear in the note

register, or make available on the Issuer’s website or another relevant internet or intranet website to which the
Trustee and each Holder of Notes has access (including any website maintained by the SEC):

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year (or such longer period as would be permitted by the

Commission if the Issuer were then subject to Commission reporting requirements as a non-accelerated filer;
provided, that such longer period shall not apply if the Commission provided such longer period exclusively to

41


-----

the Issuer), annual audited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year prepared in accordance with
GAAP, together with a report on the annual financial statements by the Issuer’s certified independent
accountants and a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
substantially similar to that which would be included in an Annual Report on Form 10-K (as in effect on the
Base Indenture Closing Date) filed with the Commission by the Issuer (if the Issuer were required to prepare
and file such form);

(2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or such longer

period as would be permitted by the Commission if the Issuer were then subject to Commission reporting
requirements as a non-accelerated filer; provided, that such longer period shall not apply if the Commission
provided such longer period exclusively to the Issuer), unaudited consolidated financial statements for such
fiscal quarter prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” substantially similar to that which would be included in a
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (as in effect on the Base Indenture Closing Date) filed with the Commission by
the Issuer (if the Issuer were required to prepare and file such form); and

(3) information substantially similar to the information that would be required to be included in a Current

Report on Form 8-K (as in effect on the Base Indenture Closing Date) filed with the Commission by the Issuer
(if the Issuer were required to prepare and file such form) pursuant to Item 1.01 (Entry into a Material
Definitive Agreement) (with respect to acquisitions and dispositions only), 1.03 (Bankruptcy or Receivership),
2.01 (Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets), 4.01 (Changes in Registrant’s Certifying
Accountants) or 5.01 (Changes in Control of Registrant) of such form (and in any event excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the financial statements, pro forma financial information and exhibits, if any, that would be
required by Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits) of such form), within 15 days after the date of filing
that would have been required for a current report on Form 8-K; provided that no such information shall be
required to be furnished if the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such information is not material
to the Holders of the Notes or the business, assets, operations or financial position of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

In addition, the Issuer will make such information available to securities analysts and prospective investors

upon request. In addition, the Issuer has agreed that, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, it will furnish to
the Holder of the Notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that the Issuer furnishes to the Trustee and the Holders an

Annual Report for any parent company of the Issuer on Form 10-K for any fiscal year, as filed with the
Commission, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year (or such longer period as would be permitted by the
Commission if such parent company of the Issuer were then subject to Commission reporting requirements as a nonaccelerated filer; provided, that such longer period shall not apply if the Commission provided such longer period
exclusively to the Issuer (or such parent company of the Issuer)), such Form 10-K shall satisfy all requirements of
clause (1) above with respect to such fiscal year, (ii) in the event that the Issuer furnishes to the Trustee and the
Holders a Quarterly Report for any parent company of the Issuer on Form 10-Q for any fiscal quarter, as filed with
the Commission, within 45 days after the end of such fiscal quarter (or such longer period as would be permitted by
the Commission if such parent company of the Issuer were then subject to Commission reporting requirements as a
non-accelerated filer; provided, that such longer period shall not apply if the Commission provided such longer
period exclusively to the Issuer (or such parent company of the Issuer)), such Form 10-Q shall satisfy all
requirements of clause (2) above with respect to such fiscal quarter and (iii) in the event that the Issuer furnishes to
the Trustee and the Holders a Current Report for any parent company of the Issuer on Form 8-K that includes
information pursuant to Item 1.01 (Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement) (with respect to acquisitions and
dispositions only), 1.03 (Bankruptcy or Receivership), 2.01 (Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets),
4.01 (Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountants) or 5.01 (Changes in Control of Registrant) of such form (and
in any event excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the financial statements, pro forma financial information and
exhibits, if any, that would be required by Item 9.01 (Financial Statements and Exhibits) of such form), as filed with
the Commission, within 15 days after the date of filing that would have been required for a current report on Form
8-K, such Form 8-K shall satisfy all requirements of clause (3) above with respect to such information.

42


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the information and reports referred

to above to the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes if the Issuer (or any parent company of the Issuer) has filed
such information or reports with the Commission via the EDGAR filing system and such information and reports are
publicly available.

Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in no event shall any information or reports delivered

pursuant to this covenant be required to (x) include any separate consolidating financial information with respect to
the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Affiliate of the Issuer, (y) comply with Section 302, Section 404
and Section 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or related items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act and (z) comply with Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 and Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X
under the Securities Act, as the same may be amended or any successor law, rule or regulation.

With respect to all of the foregoing, the Trustee shall have no obligation to determine whether such information,

documents or reports have been so posted or filed. Delivery of such information, documents and reports to the
Trustee under the Indenture is for informational purposes only and the information and Trustee’s receipt of the
foregoing shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, or determinable
from information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants thereunder (as to
which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate). The Trustee shall have no duty to
review or analyze reports delivered to it. Additionally, the Trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a
continuing basis or otherwise, the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants or with respect to any reports or other
documents filed with the SEC or any internet or intranet website or datasite under the Indenture.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Under the Indenture, an Event of Default is defined as any of the following:

(1) the Issuer defaults in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of

principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) the Issuer defaults in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes and such

default continues for a period of 30 days;

(3) the Issuer defaults in the performance of, or breaches any covenant, warranty or other agreement

contained in, the Indenture (other than a default in the performance or breach of a covenant, warranty or
agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1) or (2) above) and such default or breach continues for a
period of (i) 180 days with regard to “—Reports” or (ii) 60 days with regard to other covenants, warranties or
agreements contained in the Indenture, in each case after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of outstanding Notes under the Indenture; provided that a
notice of Default with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders more than two years prior
to such notice of Default, may not be given and any such notice shall be invalid and have no effect; provided,
further, that such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a
“Notice of Default”; provided, further, that when a Default or an Event of Default is cured, it ceases;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is

secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or the
payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee exists on or is created after the Issue
Date, if (A) such default either (1) results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or (2) relates to an obligation other than the
obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or
holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its Stated Maturity and (B) the
principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in
default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or
the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $75.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) or
more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy affecting the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary;

43


-----

(6) the failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments (net of amounts covered

by insurance policies issued by reputable and creditworthy insurance companies) aggregating in excess of $75.0
million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days
after such judgment becomes final, and, with respect to any judgments covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(7) the Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated

by the terms thereof) or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under the Indenture or any Guarantee,
other than by reason of the discharge of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with
the Indenture, and such Default continues for 10 days; or

(8) with respect to any Collateral, individually, having a fair market value in excess of $75.0 million, any

of the Security Documents ceases to be in full force and effect, or any of the Security Documents ceases to give
the Holders of the Notes the Liens purported to be created thereby, or any of the Security Documents is declared
null and void or the Issuer or any Guarantor denies in writing that it has any further liability under any Security
Document (in each case other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or any of the Security
Documents), except to the extent that any loss of perfection or priority results from the failure of the Collateral
Agent (or any other collateral agent for any Secured Indebtedness) to maintain possession of certificates
actually delivered to it representing securities, promissory notes or other instruments pledged under the Security
Documents, or otherwise results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or the Collateral
Agent (or any other collateral agent for any Secured Indebtedness) and except, as to Collateral consisting of real
property, to the extent that such failure is covered by a lender’s title insurance policy and the Collateral Agent is
reasonably satisfied with the credit of such insurer; provided, that if a failure of the sort described in this clause
(8) is susceptible of cure (including with respect to any loss of Lien priority on material portions of the
Collateral), no Event of Default shall arise under this clause (8) with respect thereto until 30 days after an
Officer becomes aware of such failure.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer)

shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding Notes
under the Indenture may declare the principal of and accrued interest on such Notes to be due and payable by notice
in writing to the Issuer and the Trustee specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a “notice of
acceleration” (the “Acceleration Notice”), and the same shall become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, then all

unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes shall ipso
_facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of each Trustee or_
any Holder of the Notes.

The Indenture provides that, at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes as

described in the two preceding paragraphs, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may rescind
and cancel such declaration and its consequences:

(1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree;

(2) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest

that has become due solely because of the acceleration; and

(3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest and

overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes issued and then outstanding under the Indenture may

waive any existing Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and its consequences, except a default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on such Notes.

44


-----

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default

and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and
rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, if within 20 days after
such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the
Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders thereof
have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default
or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and under

the Trust Indenture Act, if provisions from the Trust Indenture Act are incorporated into the Indenture. Subject to
the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any
of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes,
unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, liability or expense. Subject to all provisions of the Indenture and applicable law, the Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under such Indenture have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust
or power conferred on the Trustee.

Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or

stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the
subject of litigation.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.

The Issuer is required, within ten business days, upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver
to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transaction**

The Indenture provides that, in connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition

Transaction, at the Issuer’s election, (a) for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture
which requires that no Default, Event of Default, specified Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, has
occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the
Issuer, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default, specified Default or specified Event of Default,
as applicable, exists on the date (x) a definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into,
(y) in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (or any
equivalent thereof under the laws, rules or regulations in any other applicable jurisdiction) applies, on which a “Rule
2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction is
made (or the equivalent notice under such equivalent laws, rules or regulations in such other applicable jurisdiction)
or (z) notice of redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is given. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has exercised its option
under the first sentence of this clause (a), and any Default, Event of Default, specified Default or specified Event of
Default, as applicable, occurs following the date (x) a definitive agreement for the applicable Limited Condition
Transaction was entered into, (y) in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on
Takeovers and Mergers (or any equivalent thereof under the laws, rules or regulations in any other applicable
jurisdiction) applies, on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer in respect of a target
of a Limited Condition Transaction is made (or the equivalent notice under such equivalent laws, rules or
regulations in such other applicable jurisdiction) or (z) notice of redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction
and discharge or repayment of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is given and prior to the
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such Default, Event of Default, specified Default or
specified Event of Default, as applicable, shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of
determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction is permitted
hereunder, and (b) in connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction,
for purposes of (1) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of the
First Lien Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio or the Senior Secured Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio or any other
financial measure; (2) testing baskets set forth in the Indenture (including baskets measured as a percentage of
EBITDA); or (3) any other determination as to whether any such Limited Condition Transaction and any related
transactions (including any financing thereof) complies with the covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture,
in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited

45


-----

Condition Transaction, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted
hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date (x) a definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is
entered into, (y) in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and
Mergers (or any equivalent thereof under the laws, rules or regulations in any other applicable jurisdiction) applies,
the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer in respect of a target of a Limited
Condition Transaction is made (or the equivalent notice under such equivalent laws, rules or regulations in such
other applicable jurisdiction) or (z) notice of redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or
repayment of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is given, as applicable (the “LCT Test Date”), and
if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness and Liens and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Issuer
ending prior to the LCT Test Date for which consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available, the Issuer
could have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, basket or amount, such
ratio, basket or amount shall be deemed to have been complied with; provided that (a) if financial statements for one
or more subsequent fiscal years or quarters shall have been delivered pursuant to the requirements described under
the caption “—Certain Covenants—Reports” prior to the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is
consummated, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, baskets or amounts on the
basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the
applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, baskets or amounts and (b) except as contemplated in the
foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, baskets or amounts (and any related requirements and conditions)
shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition
Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including any Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness
and Liens and the use of proceeds thereof).

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios, baskets or amounts for

which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any
such ratio, basket or amount, including due to fluctuations in exchange rates or in EBITDA of the Issuer or the
Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction or any applicable currency exchange rate, at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such ratios, baskets or amounts will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If the Issuer has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition
Transaction, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio, basket or amount with respect to the
Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness or Liens, or the making of dividends, distributions, investments, asset sales,
mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer or the
designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the
date on which (1) such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated, (2) the definitive agreement for, or firm
offer in respect of, such Limited Condition Transaction (if an acquisition or investment) is terminated or expires
without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or (3) such notice of redemption, repurchase,
defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is
revoked or expires without consummation, any such ratio, basket or amount shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any
Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness and Liens and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. As
used herein, the term “Limited Condition Transaction” means (x) any acquisition, including by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or other business combination or the acquisition of Capital Stock or otherwise, by one
or more of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of any assets, business or Person or any other investment
permitted by the Indenture whose consummation is not conditioned on the availability of, or on obtaining, third
party financing or (y) any redemption, repurchase, defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or repayment of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock requiring notice in advance of such redemption, repurchase,
defeasance, satisfaction and discharge or prepayment.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any direct or

indirect parent company or Subsidiary of the Issuer, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer
or any Guarantor under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture or the Security Documents or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

46


-----

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations with respect to the Notes of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture will terminate

(other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes issued under the
Indenture. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations and the obligations of the
Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture (“Legal Defeasance”) and
cure all then existing Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or

interest or premium, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of

Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in

connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and each

Guarantor released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”)
and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including nonpayment,
bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events of the Issuer but not its Restricted Subsidiaries)
described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to
the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under the Indenture:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes,

(i) in the case of Notes denominated in U.S. Dollars, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities,
or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities and (ii) in the case of Notes
denominated in Euro, cash in euros, non-callable European Government Securities, or a combination of cash in
euros and non-callable European Government Securities, in amounts for purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) above
as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the
principal of, or interest and premium, if any, on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being
defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; provided that upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium (as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture with respect to each
series of Notes), the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an
amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium (as defined in the applicable
supplemental indenture with respect to each series of Notes) calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”)
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of
such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward
such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel

reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(A) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a

ruling or

(B) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax

law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the
holders of the respective outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income

47


-----

tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel

reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the
holders of the respective outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a

Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and any
simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection
therewith);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or

constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound
(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit
and any simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in
connection therewith);

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by

the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent
of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel (which

opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions
precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, all Liens on the Collateral

securing the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes will be released and the Security Documents shall cease to be of
further effect.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, any

Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) then outstanding
voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the
Notes or any Guarantee may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) then outstanding voting as a single class (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that (x) if
any such amendment or waiver will only affect one series of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then outstanding
under the Indenture, then only the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such
series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment or waiver by its terms will affect a
series of Notes in a manner different and materially adverse relative to the manner such amendment or waiver
affects other series of Notes, then the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such
series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Notes) shall be required.

48


-----

Without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver of the Indenture may not (with respect to

any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or

waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with

respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under
the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, premium, if any, on the

Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) amend or waive the legal right of any Holder of any Note to receive payment of principal of and

interest on such Note on or after the respective Stated Maturity for such principal or interest payment date for
such interest expressed in such Note, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after
such respective Stated Maturity or interest payment date;

(6) modify the Guarantees of Significant Subsidiaries in any manner materially adverse to the Holders of

the Notes; or

(7) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

In addition, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in principal amount of Notes then

outstanding, no amendment, supplement or waiver may make any change to any Security Document or the
Intercreditor Agreement or the specified provisions in the Indenture dealing with the Collateral or the Security
Documents, that would release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents
(except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement).

Notwithstanding the preceding three paragraphs, without the consent of any Holder of Notes, the Issuer, the

Guarantors, the Trustee, the Indenture Authorized Representative, and the Collateral Agent (if applicable) may
amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, any Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any other applicable intercreditor agreement:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes.

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s obligations to Holders of Notes in the case of a merger or

consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of Notes or

that does not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(5) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the

Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act; or

(6) to conform the text of the Indenture (including any supplemental indenture or other instrument

pursuant to which Notes are issued), the Guarantees, the Notes, any Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any other applicable intercreditor agreement to any provision of this “Description of Senior
Secured Notes” of this listing circular or, with respect to subsequent issuances, the Description of Senior
Secured Notes in the relevant subsequent listing circular;

(7) to add a Guarantee of the Notes, including, without limitation, by any parent company of the Issuer;

49


-----

(8) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the

Indenture as of the Base Indenture Closing Date, or to provide for the issuance of Exchange Notes;

(9) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of

Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance, administration and
book-entry transfer of the Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended
would not result in the Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law
and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer the Notes;

(10) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee or collateral agent so

long as the successor trustee or collateral agent is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms
of the Indenture;

(11) to secure the Notes or to add to the Collateral (including to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant

any other Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, as
additional security for the payment and performance of all or any portion of the Obligations with respect to the
Notes, in any property or assets, including any that are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in
which a Lien is required to be granted, to or for the benefit of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Indenture,
any of the Security Documents or otherwise);

(12) to provide for Additional Obligations pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Intercreditor

Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement; or

(13) to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to

or securing the Notes when such release, termination or discharge is provided for under the Indenture or any of
the Security Documents.

The intercreditor provisions of the Security Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable

intercreditor agreement may be amended from time to time with the consent of the parties thereto. In addition, the
Issuer may, without the consent of any other party thereto, amend the Security Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement to designate indebtedness as “Additional Pari Passu
Obligations,” or as any other indebtedness subject to terms and provisions of such agreement.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes, when:

(1) either:

(A) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been

replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust, have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation; or

(B) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and

payable by reason of the mailing or delivery of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and
payable by reason of the mailing or delivery of a notice of redemption or otherwise within one year and the
Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for
the benefit of the Holders, (i) in the case of Notes denominated in U.S. Dollars, cash in U.S. dollars, noncallable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government
Securities and (ii) in the case of Notes denominated in Euro, cash in euros, non-callable European
Government Securities, or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government
Securities, in amounts for purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) above as will be sufficient without consideration
of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation of principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium (as
defined in the applicable supplemental indenture with respect to each series of Notes), the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium (as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture with respect

50


-----

to each series of Notes) calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium
Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with
the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall
be applied toward such redemption;

(2) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the

deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

The Notes of any series will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect, when:

(1) either:

(A) all Notes of such series that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that

have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose payment money has been deposited in trust,
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(B) all Notes of such series that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become

solely for the benefit of the Holders, (i) in the case of Notes denominated in U.S. Dollars, cash in U.S.

Government Securities and (ii) in the case of Notes denominated in Euro, cash in euros, non-callable

Trustee for cancellation of principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium (as
defined in the applicable supplemental indenture with respect to such series of Notes), the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Notes of such series to the extent that an amount is

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel (which opinion of counsel

may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to
satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Indenture limits its right to obtain payment

of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or
otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting
interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, (if the Indenture is qualified under the Trust Indenture Act)
apply to the Commission for permission to continue or resign.

51


-----

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the

time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to
certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee
will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own
affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of Notes, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee security and
indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Notices to Holders of Offered Notes**

All notices to holders of Offered Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in

the Register maintained by the Registrar. In addition, if and for so long as any of the Offered Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market, and to the
extent that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of
the Offered Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules and regulations of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu) or otherwise made available. For Offered Notes which are represented by global certificates held
on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream’s, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or
Clearstream’s for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than

once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made, provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a holder shall be mailed to such Person by first class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to him if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a
notice or communication to a holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other holders. If
a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture provides that it and the Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of

the State of New York.

The Issuer has not qualified and does not expect to qualify the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. The

Indenture will accordingly not be subject to the Trust Indenture Act, and will not contain any provision
corresponding or similar to certain provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that would otherwise apply if the Indenture
were so qualified, including Trust Indenture Act §316(b).

consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies); provided that a Below Investment Grade

reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the
Holders of Notes in writing at their request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or

Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Measurement Period or subsequent to the Measurement Period

that have been or are expected to be realized and for which the actions necessary to realize such cost savings,
reductions and synergies are taken or expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of any such
Specified Transaction (in each case as though such cost savings, reductions and synergies had been realized on the
first day of the applicable Measurement Period).

In the event that any calculation of the First Lien Indebtedness to EBITDA Ratio shall be made as of the date of

the initial borrowing of any applicable Indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the entire committed amount of
such Indebtedness (as contemplated by clause (26) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”), such committed amount
may thereafter be borrowed and reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, and secured by Liens without

date of the initial borrowing of any applicable Indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the entire committed
amount of such Indebtedness (as contemplated by clause (26) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”), such

interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained

by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including some states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition,
while the notes are in global form, holders of Book- Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders”
of notes for any purpose (other than for certain tax purposes).

So long as the notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees) will be

considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture governing the notes offered
hereby. In addition, participants, whether direct or indirect, in Euroclear, or Clearstream must rely on the procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may be, which may change from time to time.

We, the Trustee, the registrar, any co-registrar and any paying agents for the notes and our or their respective

agents will not have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their

respective nominees) will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with
the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing
practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent
fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest
of less than €100,000 may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest, if

any) will be made by us to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee, which will
distribute such payments to their respective participants in accordance with their respective procedures, provided,
that at the option of Warner Music Group, payment of interest on the notes may be made by check mailed to the
holders of such notes as such addresses appear in the note register. Payments of all such amounts will be made
without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by law. We expect that payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through those participants will be governed by standing
customer instructions and customary practices.

Under the terms of the indenture governing the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the notes offered hereby, we,

the Trustee, the registrar, any co-registrar and any paying agents for the notes and our or their respective agents will
treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the
owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, the Trustee, the
registrar, any co-registrar and any paying agents for the notes and our or their respective agents will have no
responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant

relating to payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest for any such payments made by Euroclear
or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest;

(2) Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

(3) the records of the common depositary for the Global Notes.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of,

premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to
holders of interests in such notes through Euroclear or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of

notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given
such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the
indenture governing the notes offered hereby or the notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, transfers between

participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s rules, as
applicable, and will be settled in immediately available funds. The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set
forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on
transfers and certification requirements as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, Unrestricted Book-Entry Interests may be exchanged for

Restricted Book-Entry Interests only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

76


-----

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the

indenture governing the notes offered hereby) to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a person:

(A) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning

of Rule 144A;

(B) purchasing for its own account or the account a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction

meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(C) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other

jurisdictions.

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an

Unrestricted Book-Entry Interest, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture governing the notes
offered hereby) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or
Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest
transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the

form of a Book-Entry Interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Certificated Notes**

Under the terms of the indenture governing the notes offered hereby, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will

receive notes in certificated form only:

(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as

a depositary for the Global Note or (b) ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act
and, in either case, a qualified successor depositary is not appointed;

(3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default under the terms of the indenture

governing the notes offered hereby with respect to the notes and the Trustee has received a written request
from Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to issue such notes in certificated form; or

(4) at any time if we, in our sole discretion, determine that all Global Notes, as the case may be,

should be exchanged for notes in certificated form.

In all cases, notes issued in certificated form delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interest in

a Global Note will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf
of Euroclear or Clearstream in respect with their customary procedures, and they will bear the applicable restrictive
legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless such legend is not required by applicable law.

Notes in certificated form may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in

accordance with the indenture governing the notes offered hereby and only after the transferor first delivers to the
Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the indenture governing the notes offered hereby) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such notes, and we may require a
holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the indenture governing the notes offered hereby.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. The

following summaries of those operations and procedures are provided solely for the convenience of investors. The
operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that respective settlement system and may be
changed at any time. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

77


-----

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and

settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in
the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things,
services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities
lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others
such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect

participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, as the case may be, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United

States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction

(4) The purchaser acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of

beneficial interests in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration statement)
the holder of notes or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be
required to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and
submit such certifications and other documentation as provided in the applicable Indenture.

subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or to provisions
under applicable federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such
provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”) and (iii) entities the underlying assets of which are

respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold, sell, exchange, vote or provide any consent with
respect to such securities.

81


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Under the terms and conditions to be set forth in the purchase agreement with respect to the notes, we will agree

to sell to the initial purchasers the following respective principal amounts of notes set forth opposite their names
below.

**Principal Amount**

**Initial Purchaser** **of Notes**
Credit Suisse International......................................................................................... € 89,000,000

Citigroup Global Markets Limited ............................................................................ € 74,173,000

J.P. Morgan Securities plc ......................................................................................... € 74,173,000

Merrill Lynch International ....................................................................................... € 74,173,000

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ...................................................................................... € 74,173,000

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC....................................................................................... € 59,308,000

Total....................................................................................................................... € 445,000,000

The purchase agreement will provide that the initial purchasers are obligated to purchase all of the notes if any

of such notes are purchased. The purchase agreement will also provide that if an initial purchaser defaults, the
purchase commitments of non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the offering may be terminated.

The initial purchasers propose to offer the notes in the United States and Canada initially at the offering prices

on the cover page of this listing circular. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. Certain initial
purchasers have informed us that they may resell the notes to or through one or more of their affiliates or selling
agents.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United

States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A under the Securities Act and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
Securities Act. Each of the initial purchasers has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement, it will
not offer, sell or deliver the notes (i) as part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells notes in reliance on Regulation S
during such 40-day period, a confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the notes are restricted as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United

States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in such offering), may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

We will agree to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities or to contribute to payments which they may

be required to make in that respect.

The notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no market. The initial purchasers have

advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole
discretion. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, and may be limited during any exchange offer for the notes and the pendency of any shelf
registration statement relating to the notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or
liquidity of any market for the notes.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the closing date

specified on the cover page of this listing circular, which will be the seventh business day following the date of
pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+7”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the SEC under the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties

82


-----

to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of
pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will
settle in T+7, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days
should consult their own advisor.

The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty

bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

  - Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial
purchasers.

  - Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do
not exceed a specified maximum.

  - Covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

  - Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the
notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover
short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the notes to be

higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time.

In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their respective

affiliates have in the past and may in the future engage in investment banking or other transactions of a financial
nature with us, Access and our respective affiliates, for which they have received customary compensation. We
intend to use the net proceeds of the notes offered hereby, together with available cash, to redeem the 3.625% Notes.
Certain of the initial purchasers and/or affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may hold positions in the 3.625%
Notes and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering. Furthermore, banking affiliates
of certain of the initial purchasers are lenders and agents under our Revolving Credit Facility and are lenders and
agents under our Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement. The decision of these initial purchasers to distribute the notes
was made independent of the lenders with which they are affiliated, which lenders have no involvement in
determining whether or when to distribute the notes under this offering or the terms of the offering.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market - Solely for the**

purposes of the manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led
to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each
as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturer's target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer`s target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or

otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who
is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key
information document required by the EU PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.
This listing circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA will be

83


-----

made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of notes. This listing circular is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or

otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who
is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined
in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
Prospectus Regulation”).

Consequently no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the

notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be lawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation.

This listing circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in the UK will be made pursuant

to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
securities. This listing circular is not a prospectus for purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

In the UK, this listing circular is being distributed only to and is directed only at (i) persons who are

“investment professionals” falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Promotion Order, (ii) high net worth
companies, unincorporated associations and other bodies within the categories described in Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of
the Financial Promotion Order and (iii) any other persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of the notes
may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to
as “relevant persons”). Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this listing circular or any
of its contents. Any investment or investment activity to which this listing circular relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Canada**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are

accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the
_Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration_
_Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in_
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for

rescission or damages if this listing circular (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation,
provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed
by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or

**U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase,

ownership and disposition of the notes by U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) that purchase
such notes at their issue price (generally the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold, excluding
sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement
agents or wholesalers) pursuant to this offering and hold such notes as capital assets. This discussion is based on the
Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations
thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or
to different interpretation. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that
may be relevant to specific Holders (as defined below) in light of their particular circumstances (including Holders
that are directly or indirectly related to us and accrual method holders that have an “applicable financial statement”)
or to Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (such as banks, insurance companies,
dealers in securities or other Holders that generally mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, tax-exempt entities, retirement plans, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
certain former citizens or residents of the United States, Holders that hold a note as part of a straddle, hedge,
conversion or other integrated transaction or U.S. Holders that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S.
dollar). This discussion does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax considerations or any U.S. federal
estate, gift or alternative minimum tax considerations. This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income
tax considerations that may be relevant to Holders that participate in a redemption of the 3.625% Notes.

As used in this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S. federal

income tax purposes, is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (x) with respect to which
a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (y) that has in effect a valid election under
applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

As used in this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is neither a U.S.

Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the term “Holder” means a U.S. Holder or a NonU.S. Holder.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes invests in a note, the U.S. federal

income tax considerations relating to such investment will depend in part upon the status and activities of such entity
and the particular partner. Any such entity should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax
considerations applicable to it and its partners relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of a note.

EACH PERSON CONSIDERING AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX

ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME, ESTATE
AND OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION
OF THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

**Certain Additional Payments**

In certain circumstances, we are required to make payments on the notes other than stated principal and interest.

For example, we are required to pay 101% of the principal amount of any note purchased by us at the Holder’s
election after a change of control, as described above under the heading “Description of Senior Secured Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”.

U.S. Treasury regulations provide special rules for contingent payment debt instruments that, if applicable,

could cause the timing, amount and character of a Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the notes to be
different from those described below. We intend to treat the possibility of our making any of the above payments as
not causing the notes to be contingent payment debt instruments. Our treatment will be binding on all Holders,
except a Holder that discloses its differing treatment in a statement attached to its timely filed U.S. federal income
tax return for the taxable year during which such Holder acquired its notes. However, our treatment is not binding on
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). If the IRS were to challenge our treatment, a Holder might be
required to accrue income on the notes in excess of stated interest and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital

85


-----

gain, gain recognized on the disposition of the notes. In any event, if we actually make any such payment, the
timing, amount and character of a Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the notes may be affected. Each
Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments and any such payment that it actually receives. The remainder of this discussion assumes
that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

**_Interest on the Notes_**

In general, interest payable on a note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income when it is

received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. The notes are not expected to be issued with more than de minimis original issue discount (“OID”).
However, if the notes are issued with more than de minimis OID, each U.S. Holder generally will be required to
include OID in income (as interest) as it accrues, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, using a constant yield method, before such U.S. Holder receives any payment
attributable to such income. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not issued with more than
_de minimis OID._

The amount of interest paid with respect to a note that is includible in income by a U.S. Holder that uses the

cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the U.S. dollar value of the amount paid in euro
translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received by such U.S. Holder.

The amount of interest on a note that is includible in income by a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of

accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the U.S. dollar value of such interest income that accrued during
the relevant accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued interest income generally is determined by
translating such interest income at the average rate of exchange for such accrual period (or, with respect to an
accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the taxable
year). Alternatively, such U.S. Holder may elect to translate such interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the
last day of such accrual period (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the last day of
the taxable year). If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of receipt of the payment in respect
of the related accrued interest, a U.S. Holder that has made such election may translate such accrued interest using
the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of such payment. The above election will apply to all debt
obligations held by such U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder
generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such accrued interest income on the
date the payment in respect of such interest income is received if there is any difference between the rate of
exchange used to determine such interest income and the rate of exchange on the date such payment is
received. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder generally will have a basis in euro received with respect to payments of interest on a note equal

to the U.S. dollar value of such euro on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a conversion or other disposition of
such euro by such U.S. Holder generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain

or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale, exchange, retirement or other
disposition (other than any amount attributable to accrued interest, which, if not previously included in such U.S.
Holder’s income, will be taxable as interest income to such U.S. Holder) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in such note.

A U.S. Holder that receives euro on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note generally will

have an amount realized equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the
date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (or, if such note is treated as traded on an established
securities market, on the settlement date in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer). A U.S. Holder
generally will realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss upon such sale, exchange, retirement or other
disposition (as ordinary income or loss) if there is any difference between (i) the spot rate of exchange on the date
such U.S. Holder acquired such note (or, if applicable, the settlement date for such acquisition) and (ii) the spot rate
of exchange on the date the payment in respect of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition is received or

86


-----

the date such note is disposed of, as applicable. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss, together with any
foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on such disposition in respect of accrued interest, generally will be
realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or
other disposition of the note. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a
note that is not treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss.

Any capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder has held such note for more

than one year at the time of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition. Net long-term capital gain of
certain non-corporate U.S. Holders generally is subject to preferential rates of tax. The deductibility of capital losses
is subject to limitations.

A U.S. Holder that determines its amount realized in connection with the sale, exchange, retirement or other

disposition of a note by reference to the spot rate of exchange on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other
disposition (rather than on the settlement date) may recognize additional foreign currency exchange gain or loss
upon receipt of euro from such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition.

A U.S. Holder generally will have a basis in the euro received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other

disposition of a note equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a
conversion or other disposition of such euro by such U.S. Holder generally will be treated as ordinary income or
loss.

**_Medicare Tax_**

In addition to regular U.S. federal income tax, certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are

subject to a 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income,” which may include all or a portion of their
interest income on a note and net gain, including foreign currency gain, from the sale, exchange, retirement or other
disposition of a note.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

A U.S. Holder that participates in any “reportable transaction” (as defined in U.S. Treasury regulations) must

attach to its U.S. federal income tax return a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. U.S. Holders should consult
their own tax advisors as to the possible obligation to file IRS Form 8886 reporting foreign currency exchange loss
arising from the notes or any amounts received with respect to the notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Information reporting generally will apply to payments to a U.S. Holder of interest on, or proceeds from the

sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of, a note, unless such U.S. Holder is an entity that is exempt from
information reporting and, when required, demonstrates this fact. Any such payment to a U.S. Holder that is subject
to information reporting generally will also be subject to backup withholding, unless such U.S. Holder provides the
appropriate documentation (generally, IRS Form W-9) to the applicable withholding agent certifying that, among
other things, its taxpayer identification number is correct, or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules

generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability if the
required information is furnished by such U.S. Holder on a timely basis to the IRS.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

**_General_**

Subject to the discussion below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “FATCA

Withholding”:

(a) payments of principal, interest and premium with respect to a note owned by a Non-U.S. Holder

generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that, in the case of amounts treated
as payments of interest:

87


-----

(i) such amounts are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the

United States by such Non-U.S. Holder;

(ii) such Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total

combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;

(iii) such Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation described in section 957(a)

of the Code that is related to us through stock ownership;

(iv) such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of such amounts is described in

section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and

(v) the certification requirements described below are satisfied; and

(b) a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any

gain recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note, unless (i) such gain is
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such Non-U.S. Holder,
in which event such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner described
below, or (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or
more during the taxable year of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition and certain other
conditions are met, in which event such gain (net of certain U.S. source losses) generally will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (except as provided by an applicable tax treaty).

The certification requirements referred to in clause (a)(v) above generally will be satisfied if the Non-U.S.

Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a statement (generally on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BENE), signed under penalties of perjury, stating, among other things, that such Non-U.S. Holder is not a U.S. person.
U.S. Treasury regulations provide additional rules for a note held through one or more intermediaries or passthrough entities.

If the requirements set forth in clause (a) above are not satisfied with respect to a Non-U.S. Holder, amounts

treated as payments of interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless
another exemption is applicable. For example, an applicable tax treaty may reduce or eliminate this withholding tax
if such Non-U.S. Holder provides the appropriate documentation (generally, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) to
the applicable withholding agent.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and if amounts

treated as interest on a note or gain recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note are
effectively connected with such trade or business, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
withholding tax on such interest or gain, provided that, in the case of amounts treated as interest, such Non-U.S.
Holder provides the appropriate documentation (generally, IRS Form W-8ECI) to the applicable withholding agent.
Instead, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (but not the Medicare tax
described above) on such interest or gain in substantially the same manner as a U.S. Holder (except as provided by
an applicable tax treaty). In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate if provided by an applicable tax
treaty) on its effectively connected income for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Amounts treated as payments of interest on a note to a Non-U.S. Holder and the amount of any U.S. federal tax

withheld from such payments generally will be reported annually to the IRS and to such Non-U.S. Holder by the
applicable withholding agent.

The information reporting and backup withholding rules that apply to payments of interest to certain U.S.

Holders generally will not apply to amounts treated as payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder if such Non-U.S.
Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN
or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

88


-----

Proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note by a Non-U.S. Holder effected

outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to the
information reporting and backup withholding rules that apply to payments to certain U.S. Holders, provided that the
proceeds are paid to the Non-U.S. Holder outside the United States. However, proceeds from the sale, exchange,
retirement or other disposition of a note by a Non-U.S. Holder effected through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S.
broker with certain specified U.S. connections or of a U.S. broker generally will be subject to these information
reporting rules (but generally not to these backup withholding rules), even if the proceeds are paid to such Non-U.S.
Holder outside the United States, unless such Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a
U.S. person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or
otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note by a
Non-U.S. Holder effected through a U.S. office of a broker generally will be subject to these information reporting
and backup withholding rules, unless such Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S.
person (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E to the applicable withholding agent) or
otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules

generally will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability if the
required information is furnished by such Non-U.S. Holder on a timely basis to the IRS.

**FATCA Withholding**

Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act provisions of the Code and related U.S. Treasury guidance

(“FATCA”), a withholding tax of 30% will be imposed in certain circumstances on payments of interest on the
notes. In the case of payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (such as a bank, a broker, an investment fund
or, in certain cases, a holding company), as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary, this tax generally will be
imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such institution (i) has agreed to (and does) comply with the
requirements of an agreement with the United States (an “FFI Agreement”) or (ii) is required by (and does comply
with) applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an intergovernmental agreement between the United States
and a foreign jurisdiction (an “IGA”) to, among other things, collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities or other
relevant tax authorities certain information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution and, in either case,
such institution provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status. In the case of payments
made to a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner), the tax generally will be imposed,
subject to certain exceptions, unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA
status and, in certain cases, identifies any “substantial” U.S. owner (generally, any specified U.S. person that directly
or indirectly owns more than a specified percentage of such entity). If a note is held through a foreign financial
institution that has agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement or is subject to similar
requirements under applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an IGA, such foreign financial institution (or,
in certain cases, a person paying amounts to such foreign financial institution) generally will be required, subject to
certain exceptions, to withhold tax on payments made to (i) a person (including an individual) that fails to provide
any required information or documentation or (ii) a foreign financial institution that has not agreed to comply with
the requirements of an FFI Agreement and is not subject to similar requirements under applicable foreign law
enacted in connection with an IGA. Each Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of
FATCA to the ownership and disposition of the notes.

89


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and Section

4975 of the Code prohibit employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of ERISA, as well as individual
retirement accounts and other plans, accounts and arrangements subject to Section 4975 of the Code or any entity
deemed to hold assets of a plan, account or arrangement subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(each of which we refer to as an “ERISA Plan”), from engaging in certain transactions involving “plan assets” with
persons who are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under Section 4975 of the Code with
respect to such ERISA Plans. If we are a party in interest with respect to an ERISA Plan, the purchase and holding
of the notes by or on behalf of the ERISA Plan may be a prohibited transaction under Section 406(a)(1) of ERISA
and Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, unless exemptive relief were available under an applicable statutory or
administrative exemption or there were some other basis on which the transaction was not prohibited.

Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church

plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and foreign plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not
subject to these “prohibited transaction” rules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar
rules under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (such plans, together with the ERISA Plan, the “Plans,” each of which we refer
to as a “Plan”).

To address the above concerns, the notes may not be purchased by or transferred to any investor unless such

investor makes the representations contained in paragraph 5 under “Transfer Restrictions,” which are designed to
ensure that the acquisition of the notes will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under
ERISA or the Code.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of

the applicable rules, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the notes on
behalf of or with “plan assets” of any Plan consult with their counsel regarding the relevant provisions of ERISA
and the Code and any other provision under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are
similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code and the availability of exemptive relief applicable to the purchase
and holding of the notes.
