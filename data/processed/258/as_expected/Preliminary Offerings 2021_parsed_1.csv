258_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"This offering circular includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios of Parent, including OIBDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA with the meaning and as calculated as set forth in “Offering Circular Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data,” that in each case are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or “U.S. GAAP.” We consider OIBDA to be an important indicator of the operational strengths and performance of our businesses, and believe the presentation of OIBDA helps improve the ability to understand our operating performance and evaluate our performance in comparison to comparable periods. However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our businesses. Free Cash Flow reflects our net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund our debt service requirements, ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and any dividends, prepayments of debt or repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. As a result, Free Cash Flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method management uses. Because Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Because Free Cash Flow deducts capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments from “net cash provided by operating activities” (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure), users of this information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected. Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to “EBITDA” as defined in our Revolving Credit Facility and in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, and is substantially similar to “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined under the indentures governing our Existing Senior Secured Notes and “EBITDA” as defined under our Senior Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term “EBITDA” as it is commonly used. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business, (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, vii ----- unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year.

However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our businesses. Free Cash Flow reflects our net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund our debt service requirements, ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and any dividends, prepayments of debt or repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. As a result, Free Cash Flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method management uses. Because Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Because Free Cash Flow deducts capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments from \u201cnet cash provided by operating activities\u201d (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure), users of this information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected. Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to \u201cEBITDA\u201d as defined in our Revolving Credit Facility and in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, and is substantially similar to \u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d as defined under the indentures governing our Existing Senior Secured Notes and \u201cEBITDA\u201d as defined under our Senior Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term \u201cEBITDA\u201d as it is commonly used. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business, (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, vii ----- unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year.

However, a limitation of the use of OIBDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue in our businesses. Free Cash Flow reflects our net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance. Management believes Free Cash Flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to fund our debt service requirements, ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, strategic acquisitions and investments, and any dividends, prepayments of debt or repurchases or retirement of our outstanding debt or notes in open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. As a result, Free Cash Flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method management uses. Because Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Because Free Cash Flow deducts capital expenditures and cash paid or received for investments from \u201cnet cash provided by operating activities\u201d (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure), users of this information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected. Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to \u201cEBITDA\u201d as defined in our Revolving Credit Facility and in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, and is substantially similar to \u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d as defined under the indentures governing our Existing Senior Secured Notes and \u201cEBITDA\u201d as defined under our Senior Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term \u201cEBITDA\u201d as it is commonly used. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, these terms are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business, (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, vii ----- unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies calculate OIBDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA identically (if at all), the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, these measures should not be considered as substitutes for the information contained in the historical financial information of Parent and Warner Music Group prepared in accordance with GAAP included or incorporated by reference herein.\n\nPrevious Evaluation Output:\nAnswer: No\nEvidence: \n\nReference Examples:\n(1) Negative Example (Risk Absent):\n\nExample 1 (Negative Case)\nScenario: A leading cloud computing provider offering scalable storage and computing solutions to businesses worldwide.\nObservations: Continuous investment in cutting-edge technology, strong R&D capabilities, and a robust infrastructure that supports high availability and security standards.\nModel Decision: {\""Answer\"": \""No\"", \""Evidence\"": \""The company's proactive investment in technology and strong infrastructure mitigate technology risk, positioning it as a resilient leader in the cloud computing industry.\""}\n\n\n(2) Positive Example (Risk Present):\n\nExample 2 (Positive Case)\nScenario: Traditional brick-and-mortar retail chain specializing in apparel with minimal online presence.\nObservations: Limited adoption of e-commerce platforms, outdated inventory management systems, and slow response to digital marketing trends.\nModel Decision: {\""Answer\"": \""Yes\"", \""Evidence\"": \""The company's lack of technological advancement and slow adaptation to digital retail trends expose it to significant technology risk, making it vulnerable to competition from more technologically adept retailers.\""}\n\n\nInstructions:\n1.

Our renowned family of iconic record labels, including Atlantic Records, Warner Records, Elektra Records and Parlophone Records, is home to many of the world’s most popular and influential recording artists. In addition, Warner Chappell Music, our global music publishing business, boasts an extraordinary catalog that includes timeless standards and contemporary hits, representing works by over 80,000 songwriters and composers, with a global collection of more than one million musical compositions. Our entrepreneurial spirit and passion for music has driven our recording artist and songwriter focused innovation for decades. Our Recorded Music business, home to superstar recording artists such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and Cardi B, generated $3.810 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, representing 85% of total revenues. Our Music Publishing business, which includes esteemed songwriters such as Twenty One Pilots, Lizzo and Katy Perry, generated $657 million of revenue in fiscal 2020, representing 15% of total revenues. We benefit from the scale of our global platform and our local focus. Today, global music entertainment companies such as ours are more important and relevant than ever. The traditional barriers to widespread distribution of music have been erased. The tools to make and distribute music are at every musician’s fingertips, and today’s technology makes it possible for music to travel around the world in an instant. This has resulted in music being ubiquitous and accessible at all times. Against this industry backdrop, the volume of music being released on digital platforms is making it harder for recording artists and songwriters to get noticed.

Our entrepreneurial spirit and passion for music has driven our recording artist and songwriter focused innovation for decades. Our Recorded Music business, home to superstar recording artists such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and Cardi B, generated $3.810 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, representing 85% of total revenues.

Adjusted EBITDA differs from the term “EBITDA” as it is commonly used. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to adjusting net income to exclude interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, also adjusts net income by excluding items or expenses such as, among other items, (1) the amount of any restructuring charges or reserves; (2) any non-cash charges (including any impairment charges); (3) any net loss (gain) resulting from hedging currency exchange risks; (4) the amount of management, monitoring, consulting and advisory fees paid to Access under the Management Agreement or otherwise; (5) business optimization expenses (including consolidation initiatives, severance costs and other 9 ----- costs relating to initiatives aimed at profitability improvement); (6) transaction expenses; (7) equity-based compensation expense; and (8) certain extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. It also includes adjustments for the pro forma impact of certain projected cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies and any quality of earnings analysis prepared by independent certified public accountants in connection with an acquisition, merger, consolidation or other investment. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of those limitations include: (1) it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenue for our business; (2) it does not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; and (3) it does not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In particular, this measure adds back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income; however, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are difficult to predict. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not the same as net income or cash flow provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Further, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the most recent four fiscal quarters. As a result, the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter, and it may not be comparable to the measure as calculated for any subsequent four-quarter period or any complete fiscal year. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - create liens on certain assets; and - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: - pay dividends on, and redeem and purchase, equity interests; - make investments or other restricted payments; - make prepayments on, redeem or repurchase certain debt; 13 ----- - incur certain liens; - make certain loans and investments; - incur certain additional debt; - enter into guarantees; - enter into mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; - enter into transactions with affiliates; and - pay dividends or make distributions. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - create liens on certain assets; and - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facilities depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. In addition, under the credit agreement governing the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facilities, a financial maintenance covenant is applicable if at the end of a fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and letters of credit is in excess of $105 million. Our failure to comply with obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business or may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise, and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our debt. We may, from time to time, refinance our existing indebtedness, which could result in the agreements governing any new indebtedness having fewer or less restrictive covenants, including removing or lessening restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make restricted payments. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in recording artists and songwriters, capital expenditures or dividends, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indentures governing our outstanding notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - create liens on certain assets; and - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the credit agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: - pay dividends on, and redeem and purchase, equity interests; - make investments or other restricted payments; - make prepayments on, redeem or repurchase certain debt; 13 ----- - incur certain liens; - make certain loans and investments; - incur certain additional debt; - enter into guarantees; - enter into mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; - enter into transactions with affiliates; and - pay dividends or make distributions. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - create liens on certain assets; and - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facilities depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. On May 4, 2021, certain covenants set forth in our Revolving Credit Facility were suspended, including the restriction on incurring certain additional indebtedness, based on the determination that the total indebtedness to EBITDA ratio is below the required threshold specified therein. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. In addition, under the credit agreement governing the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facilities, a financial maintenance covenant is applicable if at the end of a fiscal quarter the outstanding amount of loans and letters of credit is in excess of $105 million. Our failure to comply with obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business or may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise, and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our debt. We may, from time to time, refinance our existing indebtedness, which could result in the agreements governing any new indebtedness having fewer or less restrictive covenants, including removing or lessening restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make restricted payments. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in recording artists and songwriters, capital expenditures or dividends, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indentures governing our outstanding notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. While subject to certain restrictions in our debt agreements, if we were to pay dividends to our shareholders, the funds used to make such dividend payments would not be available to service our indebtedness. 14 -----\n\nPrevious Evaluation Output:\nAnswer: Yes\nEvidence: The Existing Notes Indentures contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions.\n\nReference Examples:\n(1) Negative Example (Risk Absent):\n\nExample 1 (Negative Case)\nScenario: Ongoing planning for elderly care is regulated at a national level with a high degree of reliance on the governmental level.\nObservations: Elderly care is considered political goodwill, but the French state directs individuals to the most economical solutions in terms of public funding (i.e., homecare for the least dependent and medicalized nursing homes for others).

258_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.2.2,There may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the notes.,"No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made in connection with the offering of the notes and the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The fair value of the collateral securing the notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among other things, the condition of our industry, the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, portions of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes. In addition, in the event of any such proceeding, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon any of the collateral may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations. The notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis with all of our existing and future indebtedness secured pursuant to the same security arrangements and future indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors, foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, or following acceleration of our indebtedness or an event of default under our indebtedness, the holders of the notes, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities will be entitled to be repaid on an equal and ratable priority basis from the proceeds of collateral. In addition, the security interest of the collateral agent for the notes will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent.

For example, the collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Also, certain items included in the collateral securing the notes, such as licenses and other permits, may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant to applicable law) and therefore the collateral agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of a foreclosure. Accordingly, the collateral agent, as collateral agent for the notes, may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral securing the notes may significantly decrease. 20 -----\n\nPrevious Evaluation Output:\nAnswer: No\nEvidence: \n\nReference Examples:\n(1) Negative Example (Risk Absent):\n\nExample 1 (Negative Case)\nScenario: Ongoing planning for elderly care is regulated at a national level with a high degree of reliance on the governmental level.\nObservations: Elderly care is considered political goodwill, but the French state directs individuals to the most economical solutions in terms of public funding (i.e., homecare for the least dependent and medicalized nursing homes for others).

State laws may limit the ability of the collateral agent to foreclose on the improved real property collateral located therein. State laws govern the perfection, enforceability and foreclosure of mortgage liens against real property which secure debt obligations such as the notes.

Debtors may have the right to reinstate defaulted debt (even if it has been accelerated) before the foreclosure date by paying the past due amounts, and a right of redemption after foreclosure. The laws of certain states may also impose “security first” or “single action” rules, which limit the type or number of judicial remedies that a creditor may seek in respect of defaults on mortgaged property, and which might affect the ability to foreclose or the timing of foreclosure on real and personal property collateral regardless of the location of the collateral and limit the right to recover any deficiency following a foreclosure. The holders of the notes, the trustee and the collateral agent for the notes may also be limited in their ability to seek remedies in the event of a breach of the covenant described under “Description of Senior Secured Notes— Certain Covenants.” Judicial decisions in some jurisdictions have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate debt as a result of a breach of similar covenants. Under these decisions, a lender seeking to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens may be required to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default.

258_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.2.9,"In the event of our bankruptcy, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon the collateral will be subject to certain bankruptcy law and other limitations.","The ability of holders of the notes to realize upon the collateral will be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of our bankruptcy. Under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, secured creditors are prohibited from repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case without bankruptcy court approval and may be prohibited from disposing of security repossessed from such a debtor without bankruptcy court approval.

258_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,849,DESCRIPTION OF SENIOR SECURED NOTES,849.13,lntercreditor Provisions,849.13.1,,"The Security Agreement sets forth certain intercreditor arrangements (the “Intercreditor Provisions”) among the holders of the Notes (as well as for the benefit of the holders of Existing Notes), the holders of certain obligations under the Senior Term Loan Agreement, certain designated hedging obligations and certain designated cash management arrangements (collectively, as more particularly defined in the Security Agreement, the “Term Loan Obligations”), the holders of certain obligations under the Senior Revolving Credit Agreement, certain designated hedging obligations and certain designated cash management arrangements (collectively, as more particularly defined in the Security Agreement, the “Revolving Obligations”) and the holders of certain additional pari passu obligations (the “Additional Pari Passu Obligations” and collectively with the Notes Obligations, the Term Loan Obligations and Revolving Obligations, the “First Lien Obligations”). Term Loan Obligations and Revolving Obligations are defined in the Security Agreement and include successor credit agreements, loan agreements or other agreements or instruments evidencing or governing the terms of any indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance, restructure, replace, renew, repay, increase or extend (whether in whole or in part and whether with the original agent and creditors or other agents and creditors or otherwise) the indebtedness and other obligations outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Agreement or the Senior Revolving Credit Agreement, as the case may be, to the extent designated by Holdings pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement. Each series of First Lien Obligations under the Security Agreement is represented by the Trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent or other debt representative for such series of First Lien Obligations (each, an “Authorized Representative”) and Credit 32 ----- Suisse AG acts as initial Authorized Representative for the Term Loan Obligations, as initial Authorized Representative for the Revolving Obligations and as initial Authorized Representative for the Notes Obligations. The Intercreditor Provisions set forth certain rights, priorities and interests of the holders of the Notes Obligations, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and Additional Pari Passu Obligations. The Intercreditor Provisions provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the holders of First Lien Obligations, including, among other things, that: (1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Liens securing all such series of First Lien Obligations shall be of equal priority; (2) each series of First Lien Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended from time to time as permitted by the Indenture and the other agreements governing the other First Lien Obligations without affecting the Lien priority or relative rights of the holders of First Lien Obligations under the Security Documents; and (3) so long as permitted by the Indenture and the agreements governing the Term Loan Obligations, the Revolving Obligations and any permitted Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Issuer may incur additional Additional Pari Passu Obligations, which may be secured equally and ratably with each other series of First Lien Obligations on the terms and conditions set forth in the Security Agreement. The Intercreditor Provisions also provide that, subject to limited exceptions, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” has the right to exercise remedies (including to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Collateral), and the Authorized Representatives of other series of First Lien Obligations have no right to take actions with respect to the Collateral. As of the Closing Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be Credit Suisse AG as Authorized Representative for the Revolving Obligations and Credit Suisse AG, as Authorized Representative on behalf of the holders of the Notes, will have no rights to take any action under the Intercreditor Provisions. The “Applicable Authorized Representative” as of any date is: (1) to the extent one or more revolving credit facilities with commitments equal to, or in excess of, $75.0 million (each, a “Major Revolving Facility”) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Revolving Facility (a “Revolver Replacement Event”), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility (or, if more than one Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments thereunder); _provided that upon the occurrence of a Revolver Replacement Event with respect to the Major Revolving_ Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments; (2) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving Facility and (y) one or more term loan facilities with Indebtedness outstanding, equal to, in excess of, $75.0 million (each, a “Major Term Loan Facility”) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Term Loan Facility (a “Term Loan Replacement Event”), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility (or, if more than one Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness); _provided that upon the occurrence of a Term Loan Replacement Event with respect to the Major Term Loan_ Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness; and (3) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving Facility and (y) no Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date or a Term Loan Replacement Event 33 ----- has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Term Loan Facility, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (a “First Lien Facility Replacement Event”), the Authorized Representative with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or Indebtedness; provided that upon the occurrence of a First Lien Facility Replacement Event with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or Indebtedness. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date,” with respect to the then Applicable Authorized Representative and with respect to any series of First Lien Obligation that is not represented by the then Applicable Authorized Representative, is the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period the Authorized Representative of such series of First Lien Obligation was a Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing the series of First Lien Obligations under which such Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative, and (b) the Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is a Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing that series of First Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise), in accordance with the agreements governing that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Collateral Agent has commenced and is pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral with reasonable diligence in light of the then existing circumstances or (2) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation proceeding. “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means the Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations with principal amount of Indebtedness or commitments thereunder equal to, or in excess of, $75 million, that is not represented by the then Applicable Authorized Representative. The Applicable Authorized Representative has the sole right to instruct the Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Collateral from any other Person. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest, or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Collateral Agent or Applicable Authorized Representative. Each Authorized Representative agrees that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Notes or the applicable First Lien Obligations) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each holder of the First Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Offered Notes by acceptance thereof, is deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any Proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of First Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the Intercreditor Provisions. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the agreements governing a series of First Lien Obligations, and the Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the 34 ----- proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations, as applicable, is required to be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of First Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of First Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Security Agreement. By agreeing to purchase Offered Notes, each noteholder authorizes the Trustee and the Indenture Authorized Representative (1) (in the case of the Trustee) to appoint the Indenture Authorized Representative to act on its behalf as the Indenture Authorized Representative under the Security Agreement, (2) to appoint the Collateral Agent to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement and under each of the other Security Documents and (3) to authorize the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Security Documents, including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any grantor thereunder to secure any of the First Lien Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Security Agreement provides that the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth therein and in the other Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent: (1) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (2) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Agreement or by the other Security Documents that the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Security Document or applicable law; (3) shall not, except as expressly set forth in Security Agreement and in the other Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a grantor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; (4) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) with the consent or at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (3) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Issuer stating that such action is permitted by the terms of the Security Agreement; and (5) shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under, and as defined in, any series of First Lien Obligations unless and until written notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First Lien Obligations or the Issuer. In addition, among other things, the Collateral Agent will not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (1) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (2) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (3) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, 35 ----- agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (4) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of the Security Agreement, any other Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Security Documents, (5) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral for any series of First Lien Obligations or (6) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any agreement relating to the First Lien Obligations, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent.",,as_expected,2021,101,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The Security Agreement sets forth certain intercreditor arrangements (the \u201cIntercreditor Provisions\u201d) among the holders of the Notes (as well as for the benefit of the holders of Existing Notes), the holders of certain obligations under the Senior Term Loan Agreement, certain designated hedging obligations and certain designated cash management arrangements (collectively, as more particularly defined in the Security Agreement, the \u201cTerm Loan Obligations\u201d), the holders of certain obligations under the Senior Revolving Credit Agreement, certain designated hedging obligations and certain designated cash management arrangements (collectively, as more particularly defined in the Security Agreement, the \u201cRevolving Obligations\u201d) and the holders of certain additional pari passu obligations (the \u201cAdditional Pari Passu Obligations\u201d and collectively with the Notes Obligations, the Term Loan Obligations and Revolving Obligations, the \u201cFirst Lien Obligations\u201d). Term Loan Obligations and Revolving Obligations are defined in the Security Agreement and include successor credit agreements, loan agreements or other agreements or instruments evidencing or governing the terms of any indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance, restructure, replace, renew, repay, increase or extend (whether in whole or in part and whether with the original agent and creditors or other agents and creditors or otherwise) the indebtedness and other obligations outstanding under the Senior Term Loan Agreement or the Senior Revolving Credit Agreement, as the case may be, to the extent designated by Holdings pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement.

The Intercreditor Provisions set forth certain rights, priorities and interests of the holders of the Notes Obligations, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and Additional Pari Passu Obligations. The Intercreditor Provisions provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the holders of First Lien Obligations, including, among other things, that: (1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Liens securing all such series of First Lien Obligations shall be of equal priority; (2) each series of First Lien Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended from time to time as permitted by the Indenture and the other agreements governing the other First Lien Obligations without affecting the Lien priority or relative rights of the holders of First Lien Obligations under the Security Documents; and (3) so long as permitted by the Indenture and the agreements governing the Term Loan Obligations, the Revolving Obligations and any permitted Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Issuer may incur additional Additional Pari Passu Obligations, which may be secured equally and ratably with each other series of First Lien Obligations on the terms and conditions set forth in the Security Agreement.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest, or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Collateral Agent or Applicable Authorized Representative. Each Authorized Representative agrees that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Notes or the applicable First Lien Obligations) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each holder of the First Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Offered Notes by acceptance thereof, is deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any Proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of First Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the Intercreditor Provisions. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the agreements governing a series of First Lien Obligations, and the Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the 34 ----- proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations, as applicable, is required to be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of First Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of First Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Security Agreement. By agreeing to purchase Offered Notes, each noteholder authorizes the Trustee and the Indenture Authorized Representative (1) (in the case of the Trustee) to appoint the Indenture Authorized Representative to act on its behalf as the Indenture Authorized Representative under the Security Agreement, (2) to appoint the Collateral Agent to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement and under each of the other Security Documents and (3) to authorize the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Security Documents, including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any grantor thereunder to secure any of the First Lien Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Security Agreement provides that the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth therein and in the other Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent: (1) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (2) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Agreement or by the other Security Documents that the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Security Document or applicable law; (3) shall not, except as expressly set forth in Security Agreement and in the other Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a grantor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; (4) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) with the consent or at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (3) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Issuer stating that such action is permitted by the terms of the Security Agreement; and (5) shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under, and as defined in, any series of First Lien Obligations unless and until written notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First Lien Obligations or the Issuer.

The \u201cApplicable Authorized Representative\u201d as of any date is: (1) to the extent one or more revolving credit facilities with commitments equal to, or in excess of, $75.0 million (each, a \u201cMajor Revolving Facility\u201d) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Revolving Facility (a \u201cRevolver Replacement Event\u201d), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility (or, if more than one Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments thereunder); _provided that upon the occurrence of a Revolver Replacement Event with respect to the Major Revolving_ Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments; (2) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving Facility and (y) one or more term loan facilities with Indebtedness outstanding, equal to, in excess of, $75.0 million (each, a \u201cMajor Term Loan Facility\u201d) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Term Loan Facility (a \u201cTerm Loan Replacement Event\u201d), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility (or, if more than one Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness); _provided that upon the occurrence of a Term Loan Replacement Event with respect to the Major Term Loan_ Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness; and (3) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving Facility and (y) no Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date or a Term Loan Replacement Event 33 ----- has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Term Loan Facility, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (a \u201cFirst Lien Facility Replacement Event\u201d), the Authorized Representative with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or Indebtedness; provided that upon the occurrence of a First Lien Facility Replacement Event with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or Indebtedness. The \u201cNon-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date,\u201d with respect to the then Applicable Authorized Representative and with respect to any series of First Lien Obligation that is not represented by the then Applicable Authorized Representative, is the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period the Authorized Representative of such series of First Lien Obligation was a Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing the series of First Lien Obligations under which such Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative, and (b) the Collateral Agent\u2019s and each other Authorized Representative\u2019s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is a Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing that series of First Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise), in accordance with the agreements governing that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Collateral Agent has commenced and is pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral with reasonable diligence in light of the then existing circumstances or (2) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation proceeding. \u201cMajor Non-Controlling Authorized Representative\u201d means the Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations with principal amount of Indebtedness or commitments thereunder equal to, or in excess of, $75 million, that is not represented by the then Applicable Authorized Representative. The Applicable Authorized Representative has the sole right to instruct the Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Collateral from any other Person. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest, or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Collateral Agent or Applicable Authorized Representative. Each Authorized Representative agrees that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Notes or the applicable First Lien Obligations) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each holder of the First Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Offered Notes by acceptance thereof, is deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any Proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of First Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the Intercreditor Provisions. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the agreements governing a series of First Lien Obligations, and the Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the 34 ----- proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations, as applicable, is required to be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of First Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of First Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Security Agreement. By agreeing to purchase Offered Notes, each noteholder authorizes the Trustee and the Indenture Authorized Representative (1) (in the case of the Trustee) to appoint the Indenture Authorized Representative to act on its behalf as the Indenture Authorized Representative under the Security Agreement, (2) to appoint the Collateral Agent to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement and under each of the other Security Documents and (3) to authorize the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Security Documents, including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any grantor thereunder to secure any of the First Lien Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Security Agreement provides that the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth therein and in the other Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent: (1) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (2) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Agreement or by the other Security Documents that the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Security Document or applicable law; (3) shall not, except as expressly set forth in Security Agreement and in the other Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a grantor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; (4) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) with the consent or at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (3) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Issuer stating that such action is permitted by the terms of the Security Agreement; and (5) shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under, and as defined in, any series of First Lien Obligations unless and until written notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First Lien Obligations or the Issuer. In addition, among other things, the Collateral Agent will not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (1) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (2) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (3) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, 35 ----- agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (4) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of the Security Agreement, any other Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Security Documents, (5) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral for any series of First Lien Obligations or (6) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any agreement relating to the First Lien Obligations, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n"", ""evaluation_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""evaluation_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Reasoning\"": \""The text focuses on legal and structural details related to intercreditor arrangements and collateral management, but it does not suggest that market pricing for the company's products or services is irrational or not based on fundamental factors.

If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the agreements governing a series of First Lien Obligations, and the Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the 34 ----- proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations, as applicable, is required to be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral.

If any holder of First Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of First Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Security Agreement. By agreeing to purchase Offered Notes, each noteholder authorizes the Trustee and the Indenture Authorized Representative (1) (in the case of the Trustee) to appoint the Indenture Authorized Representative to act on its behalf as the Indenture Authorized Representative under the Security Agreement, (2) to appoint the Collateral Agent to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement and under each of the other Security Documents and (3) to authorize the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Security Documents, including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any grantor thereunder to secure any of the First Lien Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Security Agreement provides that the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth therein and in the other Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent: (1) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (2) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Agreement or by the other Security Documents that the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Security Document or applicable law; (3) shall not, except as expressly set forth in Security Agreement and in the other Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a grantor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; (4) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) with the consent or at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (3) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Issuer stating that such action is permitted by the terms of the Security Agreement; and (5) shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under, and as defined in, any series of First Lien Obligations unless and until written notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First Lien Obligations or the Issuer.

The \u201cApplicable Authorized Representative\u201d as of any date is: (1) to the extent one or more revolving credit facilities with commitments equal to, or in excess of, $75.0 million (each, a \u201cMajor Revolving Facility\u201d) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Revolving Facility (a \u201cRevolver Replacement Event\u201d), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility (or, if more than one Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments thereunder); _provided that upon the occurrence of a Revolver Replacement Event with respect to the Major Revolving_ Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Revolving Facility with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments; (2) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving Facility and (y) one or more term loan facilities with Indebtedness outstanding, equal to, in excess of, $75.0 million (each, a \u201cMajor Term Loan Facility\u201d) are outstanding on such date, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Major Term Loan Facility (a \u201cTerm Loan Replacement Event\u201d), the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility (or, if more than one Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date, the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility with the greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness); _provided that upon the occurrence of a Term Loan Replacement Event with respect to the Major Term Loan_ Facility whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the Major Term Loan Facility with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness; and (3) to the extent (x) no Major Revolving Facility is outstanding on such date or a Revolver Replacement Event has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Revolving Facility and (y) no Major Term Loan Facility is outstanding on such date or a Term Loan Replacement Event 33 ----- has occurred and is continuing on such date with respect to each then outstanding Major Term Loan Facility, until the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (a \u201cFirst Lien Facility Replacement Event\u201d), the Authorized Representative with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations with the greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or Indebtedness; provided that upon the occurrence of a First Lien Facility Replacement Event with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative, the Applicable Authorized Representative shall be the Authorized Representative with respect to the series of First Lien Obligations with the next greatest outstanding principal amount of commitments and/or Indebtedness. The \u201cNon-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date,\u201d with respect to the then Applicable Authorized Representative and with respect to any series of First Lien Obligation that is not represented by the then Applicable Authorized Representative, is the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period the Authorized Representative of such series of First Lien Obligation was a Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing the series of First Lien Obligations under which such Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative, and (b) the Collateral Agent\u2019s and each other Authorized Representative\u2019s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is a Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the agreements governing that series of First Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise), in accordance with the agreements governing that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Collateral Agent has commenced and is pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral with reasonable diligence in light of the then existing circumstances or (2) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation proceeding. \u201cMajor Non-Controlling Authorized Representative\u201d means the Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations with principal amount of Indebtedness or commitments thereunder equal to, or in excess of, $75 million, that is not represented by the then Applicable Authorized Representative. The Applicable Authorized Representative has the sole right to instruct the Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Collateral from any other Person. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) will instruct the Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Authorized Representative of any series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) may contest, protest, or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Collateral Agent or Applicable Authorized Representative. Each Authorized Representative agrees that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the applicable series of First Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the discharge or defeasance of the Notes or the applicable First Lien Obligations) other than pursuant to the Security Documents. Each holder of the First Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Offered Notes by acceptance thereof, is deemed to have agreed that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any Proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any other holder of First Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or any of the Intercreditor Provisions. If an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the agreements governing a series of First Lien Obligations, and the Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the 34 ----- proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations, as applicable, is required to be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the Collateral Agent. Holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Collateral Agent or any other holder of First Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, holders of First Lien Obligations agree not to seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of First Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of First Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Security Agreement. By agreeing to purchase Offered Notes, each noteholder authorizes the Trustee and the Indenture Authorized Representative (1) (in the case of the Trustee) to appoint the Indenture Authorized Representative to act on its behalf as the Indenture Authorized Representative under the Security Agreement, (2) to appoint the Collateral Agent to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement and under each of the other Security Documents and (3) to authorize the Collateral Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Security Documents, including for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any grantor thereunder to secure any of the First Lien Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Security Agreement provides that the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth therein and in the other Security Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent: (1) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (2) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Security Agreement or by the other Security Documents that the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Collateral Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Security Document or applicable law; (3) shall not, except as expressly set forth in Security Agreement and in the other Security Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to a grantor or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity; (4) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (1) with the consent or at the request of the Applicable Authorized Representative or (2) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (3) in reliance on a certificate of an authorized officer of the Issuer stating that such action is permitted by the terms of the Security Agreement; and (5) shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default under, and as defined in, any series of First Lien Obligations unless and until written notice describing such Event of Default is given to the Collateral Agent by the Authorized Representative of such First Lien Obligations or the Issuer. In addition, among other things, the Collateral Agent will not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (1) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (2) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered under the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, (3) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, 35 ----- agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in the Security Agreement or any other Security Document, or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (4) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of the Security Agreement, any other Security Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Security Documents, (5) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral for any series of First Lien Obligations or (6) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in any agreement relating to the First Lien Obligations, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n"", ""evaluation_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""evaluation_step_raw"": ""```json\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Reasoning\"": \""The text does not provide any indication of high regulatory scrutiny within the industry.

The Intercreditor Provisions provide for the priorities and other relative rights among the holders of First Lien Obligations, including, among other things, that: (1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations, Term Loan Obligations, Revolving Obligations and Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Liens securing all such series of First Lien Obligations shall be of equal priority; (2) each series of First Lien Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended from time to time as permitted by the Indenture and the other agreements governing the other First Lien Obligations without affecting the Lien priority or relative rights of the holders of First Lien Obligations under the Security Documents; and (3) so long as permitted by the Indenture and the agreements governing the Term Loan Obligations, the Revolving Obligations and any permitted Additional Pari Passu Obligations, the Issuer may incur additional Additional Pari Passu Obligations, which may be secured equally and ratably with each other series of First Lien Obligations on the terms and conditions set forth in the Security Agreement.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Offered Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Offered Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of such Offered Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to such Change of Control Offer, to redeem all Offered Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of such redemption (subject to the rights of Holders of such Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date). Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Issuer may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Issuer may prohibit the Issuer from repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event unless such Indebtedness has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of those creditors accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. As described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer also has the right to redeem the Offered Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control Triggering Event or otherwise. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.” The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes.",,as_expected,2021,101,,,,

The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this “Description of Senior Secured Notes” as the “Suspension Period.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Subsidiary to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period (or upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time arising out of actions taken or events that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date the Issuer and any Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising prior to such Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, and shall have no liability for any actions taken or events that occurred during the Suspension Period, or for any actions taken or events occurring at any time pursuant to any such commitment or obligation.

The following summaries of those operations and procedures are provided solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that respective settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. 76 ----- We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, as the case may be, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 77 -----",,as_expected,2021,101,,,,

The purchase agreement will also provide that if an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the offering may be terminated. The initial purchasers propose to offer the notes in the United States and Canada initially at the offering prices on the cover page of this offering circular. After the initial offering, the offering price may be changed. Certain initial purchasers have informed us that they may resell the notes to or through one or more of their affiliates or selling agents. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each of the initial purchasers has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement, it will not offer, sell or deliver the notes (i) as part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each broker/dealer to which it sells notes in reliance on Regulation S during such 40-day period, a confirmation or other notice detailing the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Resales of the notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not it is participating in such offering), may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. We will agree to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities or to contribute to payments which they may be required to make in that respect. The notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no market. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and may be limited during any exchange offer for the notes and the pendency of any shelf registration statement relating to the notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the notes. We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the closing date specified on the cover page of this offering circular, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the SEC under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own advisor. 81 ----- The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. - Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. - Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. - Covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. - Penalty bids permit the initial purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the initial purchasers and certain of their respective affiliates have in the past and may in the future engage in investment banking or other transactions of a financial nature with us, Access and our respective affiliates, for which they have received customary compensation. We intend to use the net proceeds of the notes offered hereby, together with available cash, to redeem the 3.625% Notes. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may hold positions in the 3.625% Notes and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering. Furthermore, banking affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers are lenders and agents under our Revolving Credit Facility and are lenders and agents under our Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement. The decision of these initial purchasers to distribute the notes was made independent of the lenders with which they are affiliated, which lenders have no involvement in determining whether or when to distribute the notes under this offering or the terms of the offering.",,as_expected,2021,101,,,,

For example, we are required to pay 101% of the principal amount of any note purchased by us at the Holder’s election after a change of control, as described above under the heading “Description of Senior Secured Notes— Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”. U.S. Treasury regulations provide special rules for contingent payment debt instruments that, if applicable, could cause the timing, amount and character of a Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the notes to be different from those described below. We intend to treat the possibility of our making any of the above payments as not causing the notes to be contingent payment debt instruments. Our treatment will be binding on all Holders, except a Holder that discloses its differing treatment in a statement attached to its timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year during which such Holder acquired its notes. However, our treatment is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). If the IRS were to challenge our treatment, a Holder might be required to accrue income on the notes in excess of stated interest and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital 84 ----- gain, gain recognized on the disposition of the notes. In any event, if we actually make any such payment, the timing, amount and character of a Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the notes may be affected. Each Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments and any such payment that it actually receives. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",,as_expected,2021,101,,,,
258_1,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1107,U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,1107.2,U.S. Holders,1107.2.1,Interest on the Notes,"In general, interest payable on a note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income when it is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The notes are not expected to be issued with more than de minimis original issue discount (“OID”). However, if the notes are issued with more than de minimis OID, each U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income (as interest) as it accrues, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, using a constant yield method, before such U.S. Holder receives any payment attributable to such income. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not issued with more than _de minimis OID._ The amount of interest paid with respect to a note that is includible in income by a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the U.S. dollar value of the amount paid in euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received by such U.S. Holder. The amount of interest on a note that is includible in income by a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the U.S. dollar value of such interest income that accrued during the relevant accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued interest income generally is determined by translating such interest income at the average rate of exchange for such accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the taxable year). Alternatively, such U.S. Holder may elect to translate such interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of such accrual period (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year). If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of receipt of the payment in respect of the related accrued interest, a U.S. Holder that has made such election may translate such accrued interest using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of such payment. The above election will apply to all debt obligations held by such U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such accrued interest income on the date the payment in respect of such interest income is received if there is any difference between the rate of exchange used to determine such interest income and the rate of exchange on the date such payment is received. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder generally will have a basis in euro received with respect to payments of interest on a note equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a conversion or other disposition of such euro by such U.S. Holder generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.",,as_expected,2021,101,,,,

A U.S. Holder that receives euro on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note generally will have an amount realized equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (or, if such note is treated as traded on an established securities market, on the settlement date in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer). A U.S. Holder generally will realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss upon such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (as ordinary income or loss) if there is any difference between (i) the spot rate of exchange on the date such U.S. Holder acquired such note (or, if applicable, the settlement date for such acquisition) and (ii) the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment in respect of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition is received or 85 ----- the date such note is disposed of, as applicable. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss, together with any foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on such disposition in respect of accrued interest, generally will be realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the note. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note that is not treated as foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder has held such note for more than one year at the time of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition. Net long-term capital gain of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders generally is subject to preferential rates of tax. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder that determines its amount realized in connection with the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note by reference to the spot rate of exchange on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition (rather than on the settlement date) may recognize additional foreign currency exchange gain or loss upon receipt of euro from such sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition. A U.S. Holder generally will have a basis in the euro received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note equal to the U.S. dollar value of such euro on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a conversion or other disposition of such euro by such U.S. Holder generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss.",,as_expected,2021,101,,,,

Backup withholding is not an additional tax.

In the case of payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (such as a bank, a broker, an investment fund or, in certain cases, a holding company), as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary, this tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such institution (i) has agreed to (and does) comply with the requirements of an agreement with the United States (an “FFI Agreement”) or (ii) is required by (and does comply with) applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign jurisdiction (an “IGA”) to, among other things, collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities or other relevant tax authorities certain information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution and, in either case, such institution provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status. In the case of payments made to a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner), the tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status and, in certain cases, identifies any “substantial” U.S. owner (generally, any specified U.S. person that directly or indirectly owns more than a specified percentage of such entity). If a note is held through a foreign financial institution that has agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement or is subject to similar requirements under applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an IGA, such foreign financial institution (or, in certain cases, a person paying amounts to such foreign financial institution) generally will be required, subject to certain exceptions, to withhold tax on payments made to (i) a person (including an individual) that fails to provide any required information or documentation or (ii) a foreign financial institution that has not agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement and is not subject to similar requirements under applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an IGA.

This discussion is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different interpretation. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to specific Holders (as defined below) in light of their particular circumstances (including Holders that are directly or indirectly related to us and accrual method holders that have an “applicable financial statement”) or to Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (such as banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or other Holders that generally mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities, retirement plans, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, Holders that hold a note as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion or other integrated transaction or U.S. Holders that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar).

This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to Holders that participate in a redemption of the 3.625% Notes. As used in this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (x) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (y) that has in effect a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. As used in this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the term “Holder” means a U.S. Holder or a NonU.S. Holder. If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes invests in a note, the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to such investment will depend in part upon the status and activities of such entity and the particular partner. Any such entity should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to it and its partners relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of a note.

If we are a party in interest with respect to an ERISA Plan, the purchase and holding of the notes by or on behalf of the ERISA Plan may be a prohibited transaction under Section 406(a)(1) of ERISA and Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, unless exemptive relief were available under an applicable statutory or administrative exemption or there were some other basis on which the transaction was not prohibited. Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and foreign plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to these “prohibited transaction” rules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to similar rules under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (such plans, together with the ERISA Plan, the “Plans,” each of which we refer to as a “Plan”). To address the above concerns, the notes may not be purchased by or transferred to any investor unless such investor makes the representations contained in paragraph 5 under “Transfer Restrictions,” which are designed to ensure that the acquisition of the notes will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of the applicable rules, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of or with “plan assets” of any Plan consult with their counsel regarding the relevant provisions of ERISA and the Code and any other provision under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code and the availability of exemptive relief applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. 89 -----",,as_expected,2021,101,,,,
