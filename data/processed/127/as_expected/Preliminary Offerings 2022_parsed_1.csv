The 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements present comparable financial data as at and for the,120.2.1,Constant Basis Presentation and Other Non-IFRS Measures,"Figures presented in this Offering Circular for the Issuer are calculated on an actual historical basis and, where noted, on a constant or “like-for-like” basis, which means that comparable items are presented using a constant consolidation scope but not using constant exchange rates, unless otherwise indicated. The percentage change from one period to another has generally been given on a “like-for-like” basis in order to eliminate the impact of changes in consolidation scope (that is, changes in the entities that we consolidate in our audited consolidated financial statements due to acquisitions, divestures or mergers). For comparison purposes, we restate sales to factor in acquisitions and joint ventures, which we refer to as “boltons”. Exchange rates are restated only for sales which are reported in a currency other than euro and where we compare by applying the previous year U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate to both the previous year and the current year sales. The scope is restated by calculating this year sales as at the last year perimeter. In this Offering Circular, we present our estimated order book (calculated on a three-year rolling basis) as of 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our order book represents the sales that we expect to record when we receive firm production orders, under contracts for vehicle programs that we have been awarded but which are not yet in production. The value of our order book as of any given date is based on the estimated production volumes of vehicle programs as well as their estimated lifetime. We discount the production volumes indicated by our customers based on factors including our management’s knowledge of such customer, our historical relationship with such customer and internal and external industry forecasts. We do not increase the estimated production volumes beyond those estimates provided to us by our customers. In this Offering Circular, we present certain information relating to potential synergies which we believe may result from the Hella Acquisition. These synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. We have not included any estimate of the costs required to achieve these adjusted EBITDA and cost reduction synergies and the costs we incur in trying to realize these synergies may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit. The assumptions used in estimating these synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to a variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties. We cannot (xi) ----- assure you that the information on which we have based our assumptions will not change or that we will be able to realize any of the synergies or other benefits we believe are possible from the Hella Acquisition. In addition, this Offering Circular includes certain supplemental indicators of performance and liquidity that we use to monitor our operating performance and debt servicing ability. These indicators include adjusted EBITDA, net debt, net cash flow and the value of our order book. These measures are unaudited and we are not required to present them under IFRS. Such indicators have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, related indicators derived in accordance with IFRS. We use these non-IFRS financial measures in this Offering Circular because we believe that they can assist investors in comparing our performance to that of other companies on a consistent basis. However, our computation of adjusted EBITDA, net debt, net cash flow, value added sales and other non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. For example, depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net cash flow, order book and the other non-IFRS financial measures, as we define them, are also useful because they enable investors to understand our performance over time, without the impact of various items that we believe do not durably affect our operating performance. However, investors should not consider these measures as alternatives to measures of financial performance, operating results or cash flows that are determined in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA as presented for Forvia and Faurecia in this Offering Circular differs from adjusted EBITDA used by Hella in the Hella Annual Financial Report (as defined under “Information Incorporated by Reference” of this Offering Circular) and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the section entitled “Terms and _Conditions of the Notes” of this Offering Circular. For the respective definitions of adjusted EBITDA used by_ Forvia and Faurecia on the one hand, and Hella in the Hella Annual Financial Report on the other, and for a reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Financial and Operating Data—Other Consolidated _Financial Data.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

On 31 October 2021, Faurecia sold to APG its Acoustics and Soft Trim business, which manufactures and sells acoustic products and soft trims, with eight plants and one R&D center, all based in Europe, within the Interiors segment, for an enterprise value of €80 million.

We are successfully developing and implementing customer vehicle production programs on a global scale. We have a broad geographic footprint, and are one of the few automotive equipment suppliers with the capacity to supply automakers’ global programs where the same car model is produced throughout several regions. We are involved in all stages of the automotive equipment development and supply process. We design and manufacture automotive equipment adapted to each new car model or platform, and conclude contracts to provide these products throughout the anticipated life of the model or platform (usually between five and ten years). Our customers rely increasingly on global platforms, based upon which they will produce a variety of 3 ----- car models. This allows us to decrease costs through a greater commonality of components, and to benefit from components or modules which can be used in more than one generation of cars. We participate in this evolution by offering generic products associated with our customers’ platforms, such as standard seats frames.

We estimate that approximately one-in-two vehicles globally are equipped with at least one of our products. On 31 January 2022, we completed the Hella Acquisition. This acquisition is a strategic opportunity enabling us to create the world’s seventh largest supplier to the automotive industry with a cutting-edge technology portfolio that addresses the major trends in the industry. Following the acquisition, we rebranded ourselves with a new trade name, “Forvia”, although Faurecia and Hella are expected to continue to operate as separate legal companies and market products under their own brands, collaborating closely and aiming to create sustainable value for all stakeholders through technology solutions and synergies generated in the best interest of both companies. For further details regarding the Hella Acquisition see “—Recent Developments—Combining _Faurecia and Hella” below._ Faurecia is organised in four business groups: Faurecia Clean Mobility, Faurecia Seating, Faurecia Interiors and Faurecia Clarion Electronics. We have leading market positions in three of Faurecia’s four business groups (Faurecia Clean Mobility, Faurecia Seating and Faurecia Interiors) and are seeking to become a leader in cockpit electronics through our Faurecia Clarion Electronics business group, established following the successful acquisition of Clarion in 2019. In July 2021, we announced the creation of a new division for sustainable materials to develop and manufacture cutting-edge sustainable and smart materials.

Leveraging our global footprint, further diversified with the combination of Faurecia and Hella, the Sustainable Materials division works across business groups to propose solutions for the development of low-CO2, and even CO2-negative, materials in order for us to better support OEMs in attaining their sustainability objectives. With the integration of Hella, and to align the business models of both companies, we expect to add two new business groups: Hella Lighting and Hella Life-Cycle Solutions.

Our market leadership in Faurecia Clean Mobility, Faurecia Seating and Faurecia Interiors, and our global platforms are significant strategic advantages as customers typically look to well-established suppliers when awarding new business. Following the Hella Acquisition in January 2022, we rebranded ourselves as Forvia, the new company name combining Faurecia and Hella, on 7 February 2022.

As a result of these technological developments, the evolving structure of society and global development challenges, we believe that the automotive industry is at a turning point. We believe that the consequence of these trends on the automotive industry is a radical increase in mobility which is becoming connected, autonomous, shared and electrified. We believe the Hella Acquisition further strengthens our position and is a unique opportunity to place Faurecia at the forefront of automotive megatrends. See “—Recent Developments—Combining Faurecia and Hella” for more information on the acquisition and its anticipated impact. _Connectedness_ Vehicles with connected capabilities are becoming increasingly common. The trend for connected vehicles is driven by legislation for increasing safety, increasing customer expectations for infotainment and technological developments for autonomous cars. Connectivity will allow continuous monitoring of vehicles and passengers, the ability to upgrade software in vehicles and will provide passengers with access to a wide range of services, including for safety and on-board user experiences for comfort, well-being, productivity and entertainment. We believe that vehicles will become an integrated device in users’ “connected lives” and consumers will demand the same level of service and convenience from their cars as from their smartphones or tablets. The introduction of mobile 5G will enhance connectivity through better quality network coverage and higher bandwidth. _Autonomous_ Autonomous vehicles will provide drivers with the opportunity to engage in activities not previously possible while driving, such as relaxing, working and socializing. The level of autonomy in a vehicle is assessed from level 0 to level 5, where level 0 signifies no automation in a vehicle and level 5 is fully autonomous. Autonomous technology for level 3 and level 4 currently exists, however, we believe it is unlikely to see rapid deployment due to high cost and an undefined regulatory framework. We believe that robotaxis are likely to be the first mass application of autonomous vehicles with thousands of vehicles already on the road in pilot programs, while private cars are likely to remain focused on ADAS levels 1 and 2 systems for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we expect the automotive industry will need to extend its value-proposition to deliver new user experiences. In this context, we expect vehicle interiors will undergo a significant development and the Cockpit of the Future will be connected, personalized and predictive. The recent acceleration of powertrain electrification is likely to result in a reduction in the level of investment available for autonomous driving, with automakers focusing on the incremental deployment of Level 2 and Level 3 driver assistance systems. 6 ----- _Shared mobility_ Connectivity is also impacting the way users see mobility, as they begin to use new solutions, particularly in urban settings. Ride-sharing services and car-sharing services are experiencing significant growth, driven in particular by city strategies for improved mobility. The introduction of autonomous vehicles as robotaxis (which is an example of the concept of “mobility as a service” or “MaaS”) should accelerate the shift by significantly reducing costs per kilometer. For MaaS operators to differentiate themselves, the quality of the user experience will be key. As a result, we believe that users of shared mobility will demand personalization of a vehicle’s interior and digital continuity. Mobility operators will need to determine how to offer the best and smoothest customer journey integrating services and multimodal mobility. MaaS operators will therefore become strong vehicle, cockpit and interior specifiers, requesting specific capabilities and functionalities to support their services. In the short-term, ride-sharing services have suffered as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, including as a result of lockdowns and economic crisis, as well as increasing health concerns. However, we anticipate that the rise of micromobility alternatives and a demand for electric vehicle car-share schemes in major urban areas is likely to drive a return to shared mobility in the mid-term. _Electrification_ The powertrain mix is rapidly evolving towards electrification, due to environmental concerns and pressure from regulators and society. Whilst different countries are moving towards zero emissions at different speeds, we expect that as technologies mature, we will see a rapid increase in the number of hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles, including both BEV and FCEV. As technologies mature and charging infrastructure is deployed, we believe that there will be a rapid increase in electric vehicles and that BEVs and FCEVs will co-exist as zero emissions alternatives. We believe that fuel cells are particularly adapted to commercial vehicles as they have a longer range and a faster re-fuelling time. This trend towards zero emissions depends on a co-ordinated ecosystem that includes infrastructure and power supply providers. Electrification will accelerate as regulations and government incentives boost both offer and demand and as society becomes increasingly concerned about climate change. We believe that by 2030, 38% of vehicles will be fully electric vehicles, and 32% of vehicles will be hybrid. The significant investments being made in many countries in hydrogen as a clean energy source could be evolutionary for transportation and logistics. _Strategy aligned with automotive megatrends_ As the trends for electrification, connectivity, autonomous driving and ride-sharing accelerate, there are increasing business development opportunities for us in relation to new products, new customers and new business models including the following: New Products - accelerating innovation for powertrain electrification and investing in zero and ultra-low emissions solutions, supported by incentives and regulatory push and responsive to an increase in global demand for mild hybrid and high voltage solutions; - focusing on short time-to-market technology bricks for the Cockpit of the Future adaptable to autonomous driving, reflecting an increasing importance of software and higher willingness of customers to pay for automated driving features; - offering new functionalities through integrated electronics as cars develop into “computers on wheels”, driven in part by safety regulations; and - with the Hella Acquisition, we expect to increase our offering to include life-cycle solutions, including aftermarket, services and repairs and special applications. New Customers - rising Asian OEMs developing vehicles adapted to Asian consumers; - pure electric vehicle consumers; 7 ----- - mobility operators, fleets and cities; and - high horsepower engine manufacturers. New Business Models - increased role of personalized user experiences; - upgradability, retrofit and connected services; and - developing cybersecurity of connected products.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

The program aims at capturing a holistic picture of customer satisfaction and feedback, both in term of performance and perception of the overall value chain, from order taking to the start of production. Beyond traditional quality measures, customer feedback is collected immediately and transparently through a dedicated Customer Satisfaction digital application which allows for constant interaction with customers. This application is used by approximately 1,000 customers and we have received feedback on approximately 1,700 occasions giving us an average of 4.2 out of 5 for 2020. Based on this, we systematically implement action plans to improve customer satisfaction through the robustness of our launch performance and operational excellence to support sustained customer 9 ----- loyalty. The program was a key focus for us in 2020 and is an important element in our relationship with our customers as well as an integral part of our culture. Our Total Customer Satisfaction program comprises initiatives such as: the Faurecia Excellence System, the Plant Ranking Initiative and our Digital Manufacturing initiatives. _The Faurecia Excellence System_ The Faurecia Excellence System (“FES”) is our core operations system governing the organization of our production and operations. It is designed to continuously improve quality, cost, delivery and safety and thereby sustain and improve the operational performance of our production sites around the world through common working methods and language. We believe that this approach is fundamental to enable us to deliver the same level of quality and service throughout the world. The FES complies with applicable quality, environmental and safety standards of the automotive industry (ISO/TS 16949, IATF 16949, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001). In 2019, we redesigned the Faurecia Excellence System to support our joint goals of Total Customer Satisfaction and sustainable operational performance and deployed it across our Group. Renamed “FES X.0”, it provides a clearer, more pragmatic and comprehensive system approach designed to ensure that all employees understand their expected role. The redesigned system was launched through a major global communication and education program consisting of management workshops, multiple new digital learnings and reference documents (FES X.0 Handbook) and a global knowledge-embedding tool for our managers. We believe that FES contributes to the success of our Total Customer Satisfaction program and impacts our financial performance. _Plant Ranking Initiative_ In 2018, we launched a plant ranking initiative which is based on a monthly assessment to promote comparative analysis between production sites. Using a specific tool, plant managers are able to compare their plant’s performance with any other of our plants. The initiative is designed to encourage sharing of best practice, reduce performance gaps and promote competition between sites. In 2019, the plant ranking criteria was updated to provide greater weight to key performance indicators from our Total Customer Satisfaction program. _Digital Manufacturing_ We have introduced digital technology to improve operational efficiency and transform working practices in our production facilities. In 2017, we deployed digital management tools as part of our Digital Enterprise strategy throughout our production processes and supply chain, including real-time information sharing, collaborative robots and autonomous guided vehicles, to optimize assembly automation, quality control and production efficiency. By the end of 2021, over 2,500 smart robots and Automated Guided Vehicles were in use across our plants. More than a hundred of our factories have digital production dashboards, allowing real-time information sharing on the operation of production lines. Digital management tools and the use of “big data” to provide more control over manufacturing processes increases the potential to continue to improve the performance of our industrial assets. We have introduced artificial intelligence solutions for visual inspections of parts in order to improve quality and reduce process variability. We believe that the digitalization of the manufacturing system will strengthen plant performance. _Awards and New Order Intake_ We believe that the numerous awards that we have received from our customers and our record order intake over the last few years demonstrates the confidence of our customers in our Total Customer Satisfaction strategy. We are a strategic partner of many of our major customers, receiving 70 customer recognition awards in 2021 for global performance, manufacturing excellence, cost savings and innovation. In particular, we received a General Motors Supplier of the Year Award, a Ford World Excellence Award and a Cummins Covid19 outstanding supplier award. We also saw an improvement in customer perception with 4.5 stars out of 5 in 2021, compared to 4.2 in 2020. Over the 2019-2021 period, our cumulative order intake was approximately €75.0 billion. In 2021, €2.6 billion of our cumulative order intake was attributable to Faurecia Clarion Electronics, €6.1 billion was attributable to electric vehicles (representing 26% of total order intake) and €6.4 billion was attributable to China (representing 27% of order intake and reflecting the continued strong growth potential of the Chinese market). 10 ----- For the nine months ended 30 September 2022, Forvia achieved an order intake of over €24.5 billion. Notable new business awarded to us in 2021 and in 2022 included: - VW Passat / Skoda Superb complete seat, instrument panel & door panel, over €1.5 billion; - Chinese Chehejia LI X03 complete seat; - BMW Mini & X3/X4 Frames in China; - FAS – BMW NCAR KKL Family – EUR & CN – Frames - FIS – STELLANTIS – FCA DT 1500 – NAO – Instrumental Panel; - FAS – VW – TIGUAN – EUR – Rear Frames; - Daimler E-Class and VW Transporter for complete seats; - instrument panel businesses for the Audi Q5 and door panels for a GM platform covering different Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac vehicles for premium interiors; - clean mobility for VW Audi D-segment platform and PSA C&D segment platforms; - major cockpit assembly awards for Skoda Fabia and Mercedes Vito; - eight contract awards won by Hella to equip different EVs from German premium manufacturers with multifunctional Front Phygital Shields (Lighting); - a contract award with a global long-haul truck leader for the first mass-production of hydrogen storage systems for long-haul trucks; - interiors, cockpit assembly and seating businesses with a leading electric vehicle player in China, North America and Europe; and - award with Daimler for complete seats (first and second rows), expected to generate approximately €2 billion of sales during the course of the award. Among others, we also achieved the following recognition awards over the last few years: - our H2 activities have been selected as an “Important Project of Common European Interest” (“IPCEI”) pursuant to the European Commission’s criteria by the French Government and will be allocated €213 million (those of Symbio (50/50 joint venture with Michelin) have also been selected); - inclusion of Faurecia in the Euronext CAC 40 ESG® index; - PACE award at the Automotive News magazine’s PACE awards for developing the “Resonance Free Pipe™” (RFP™); - supplier award at the General Motors’ 2019 Supplier of the Year event; - four “Winner” and two “Special Mention” awards at the 2020 German Innovation Award competition; - outstanding program leadership award at the EcoVadis annual 2020 Sustainability Leadership Awards; - supplier award at the 2019 Groupe Renault Supplier event for our operational performance; - two innovation awards at the 2019 Shanghai Automotive Show for our Cockpit of the Future innovations; - “Best Quality Mindset award” at the Groupe Renault Suppliers event for our Pitesti (Romania) plant in 2019; 11 ----- - PACE finalist at the Automotive News magazine’s PACE award for our Perceptual Display Platform Vision; and - IRYStec named 2021 Automotive News magazine’s PACE award winner.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

Over the past several years we have achieved significant improvements in our profitability. Our operating income increased from 3.5% of sales in 2013 to 7.2% of sales in 2019. Although our operating income decreased to (1.8)% of sales in the first half of 2020 as a result of the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic crises, our operating income recovered strongly in the second half of 2020 to 6.2% of sales, resulting in our operating income decreasing to 2.9% of sales for the year ended 31 December 2020. For the year ended 31 December 2021, we reported a resilient operating income of €862 million, representing 5.5% of sales despite the semiconductor shortage and increase in raw material prices throughout the year. For the first half of 2022 we reported an operating income of €426 million, representing 3.7% of Forvia’s total sales, reflecting the impacts of inflation, volatility in automotive supply chains related to the war in Ukraine, and the Covid-19 related lockdowns in China during the period. Throughout the first half of 2022, we maintained sufficient liquidity and we ended the period with €4,201.5 million of available cash available as at 30 June 2022 compared to €4,905.7 as at 31 December 2021. We also had €1.95 billion of undrawn commitments, collectively, under the Senior Credit Facility and the Hella Credit Facility as at 30 June 2022, compared to €1.5 billion as of 31 December 2021. We reported net debt of €8,394.4 million as at 30 June 2022 compared to €3,467 million as at 31 December 2021. The ratio of our net debt as at 31 December 2021 to our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2021 fell to 1.6x, showing deleveraging from 1.9x as at 31 December 2020. As at 30 June 2022, net debt to LTM pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 3.1x (see “Summary Financial and Operating Data—Other consolidated financial data” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited LTM Pro Forma Financial Data”). _Structural actions and cost flexibility_ We are also implementing structural changes to make our cost structure more flexible in order to increase our agility and resilience. We aim to rationalize and optimize our industrial footprint and tightly manage our direct and indirect headcount, in addition to other selling, general and administrative cost-cutting measures. These measures have become increasingly important to us in the post Covid-19 environment. We generally seek to pass through increased raw material costs to our customers through a variety of means. Certain raw material cost fluctuations, such as for monoliths, are directly passed through, whilst others are passed through (typically with a time lag) through indexation clauses in our contracts. In addition, we seek to pass through certain other raw material costs to customers through periodic price reviews that are part of our contract management. Our ability to pass through such costs has had a positive impact on our margins and profitability. The impact of inflation in costs has been reduced by offsetting increases in steel and chemical prices through our contractual pass-through to customers. We estimate that our contractual pass-through policies have helped mitigate the impact of inflation in our raw materials costs by an average of over 80% in the first half of 2022 (calculated by comparing the impact of inflation on raw materials costs for the first half of 2022 against our estimation of raw materials inflation exposure for the period) and we believe that ongoing negotiations with customers will continue to mitigate inflationary impacts in 2022. The Group’s operations are not highly energy-intensive: in 2021, Faurecia and Hella, taken together, had energy costs (of which approximately 70% related to electricity and approximately 30% related to gas) that amounted to approximately €170 million, representing only 0.7% of sales. The Group has hedging policies in place that aim to protect our energy costs from the current sharp rise in electricity and gas prices. On top of these hedging policies, we have implemented energy savings measures and accelerated energy self-production through the installation of solar panels at our sites, which are capable of generating approximately 120 gigawatts of additional energy. 12 ----- As a result, we estimate that our total energy costs are expected to grow by only 1.8 times by 2023 compared to energy costs in 2021, whereas we expect energy prices in Europe to increase by more than 10 times in the same period. We seek to achieve steady and predictable levels of capital expenditure and working capital. We are still planning to grow while limiting our capital expenditure and capitalized R&D requirements by seeking better capital expenditure allocation.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

This 12-member body, including 8 independent board members and 2 board members representing employees, meets at least four times a year. Three permanent committees are tasked with the preparation of discussions on specific topics: the Audit Committee, the Governance, Nominations and Sustainability Committee and the Compensation Committee. They make proposals and recommendations and give advice in their respective areas. With their diverse backgrounds, experience and skills, our board members offer us their expertise, support in defining our strategy and tackling the challenges that we face within the context of our transformation and strategic direction. _The Executive Committee_ Our executive functions are performed by an Executive Committee that meets monthly to review our results and oversees our operations and the deployment of our strategy. It discusses and prepares guidelines on important operational subjects, and its decisions are then deployed throughout the Group. _Experienced Management Team_ Our management team has significant experience in the industry. Patrick Koller, our CEO, has been with the Group since 2006. Prior to becoming our CEO, he was Executive Vice President at our Faurecia Seating business group from 2006 to 2015. Michel Favre, Hella’s CEO, has been with the Group since 2013.

In the six months ended 30 June 2022, our two largest customers accounted for 33.8% of sales compared to approximately 48% of sales in 2008. We also further increased our geographic diversification by increasing the share of our North American and Asian sales. In the six months ended 30 June 2022, sales in Europe, North America and Asia were 46.1%, 25.6% and 24.2% of sales, respectively compared to approximately 74%, 15% and 6% of sales, respectively, in 2008. We benefit from a global customer base. Although Japanese and South Korean automakers tend to use their own network of suppliers, we are today a direct supplier to Nissan and Hyundai. We are present on most market segments, from entry-level models to premium and luxury cars, which make us less vulnerable to the parameters which may affect one particular segment. We also benefit from revenue visibility and stability, due to the inherent difficulties automakers face when changing suppliers in the midst of the development and production of a car model, and from a high renewal rate of our programs. We believe the Hella Acquisition further improves our inroads with automakers and opens new sales opportunities. We believe Hella’s sales may improve by leveraging Faurecia’s privileged access to key Chinese and Japanese OEMs, while we believe Hella’s position with German OEMs will contribute to developing our relationships further with German OEMs, and we believe that Faurecia and Hella will both benefit from complementary strengths with US-based OEMs (see “—Recent _Developments—Combining Faurecia and Hella”)._",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strategy,9.5.1,Sustainable Mobility,"Our current sustainability strategy rests on a long-term view towards becoming a leader in zero-emissions hydrogen solutions while developing innovative solutions for electric and hybrid vehicles in the near term. To that end, our strategic roadmap for Sustainable Mobility focuses on the following four areas: - developing hydrogen solutions for zero emissions; - developing solutions for ultra-low emission passenger vehicles; - developing solutions for ultra-low emission commercial and industrial vehicles; and - developing sustainable and smart materials. _Sustainable Mobility – Hydrogen solutions for zero emissions: We believe hydrogen mobility will accelerate_ rapidly and achieve significant adoption by 2030. Hydrogen can be produced from various energy sources and is a storable energy carrier that generates no CO2 emissions or polluting gasses when used in vehicles. We believe that hydrogen is very well suited to commercial, heavy-duty on- and off-road vehicles, as well as high-horsepower engines, giving it the potential to transform transportation and logistics. By 2030, it is estimated that three to five million vehicles equipped with fuel cell technology will be on the roads (source: _Hydrogen Council Discussion Paper 2018). Since 2018, we have halved the cost of our fuel cell systems and_ our objective is to continue to reduce the cost significantly. We are developing the next generation of hydrogen systems for commercial and light vehicles, heavy-duty trucks and industrial applications. We currently have the ability to produce several thousands of hydrogen storage systems per year and we aim to significantly increase our production capacity. We aim to become a leader both in hydrogen storage systems and distribution services, which we develop inhouse and for which we have created a centre of excellence in France, and in fuel cell stack systems and services produced by Symbio. We are well-positioned in both of these key elements of fuel cell systems, which we estimate represent 75% of the value chain. We are aiming to expand our production capacity exponentially between now and 2025 to 100,000 tanks per year across three sites: a high-capacity site in Allenjoie, France (serial production to start in 2023 with strong ramp-up in 2024), another site under construction in Lyon, France dedicated to low-volume programs, and a plant in Asia in order to better serve this key market for hydrogen mobility. In line with this ambition, in 2020 we inaugurated our global center of expertise, which aims to develop lightweight and cost-competitive hydrogen storage systems. Located in Bavans, France, the center is dedicated to the design and tests of these systems. Our homologated tanks (350 / 700 bar) will also be produced at this 14 ----- new center. With this global center, we also aim to develop new industrial processes to accelerate production and develop innovative materials and smart tanks to reduce the cost of the systems and increase their safety, durability and recyclability. In 2019, we set up a joint venture with Michelin, incorporating each of its fuel cell related activities, including its subsidiary Symbio, with our fuel cell related activities with the aim of creating a world leader in hydrogen fuel cell systems. Moreover, in 2020, we acquired Ullit for high-pressure tanks. We believe this acquisition with Ullit’s patented technology for impermeable tank shells will help reinforce our unique hydrogen ecosystem. We recently acquired a majority share in CLD, one of China’s largest high-pressure tank manufacturers. We are working with CLD to develop and manufacture type III and IV hydrogen storage tanks for the Chinese market. Sustainable Mobility – Solutions for ultra-low emission passenger vehicles:_ The requirement for increasing content in the powertrain to meet emissions control regulations, as well as the need for significant reduction in CO2 emissions, drive the need for several of our key technologies which we estimate will increase the overall value of the exhaust line by 20% by 2030. We supply post-treatment systems for internal combustion and hybrid powered engines in order to reduce emissions and noise levels and recover lost energy. The key technologies for fuel economy and emissions reduction that are already in production or will be by 2025 are the Electric Heated Catalyst (“EHC”) solutions including a pre-heating function that can give a near zero emissions vehicle, and a combined Exhaust Gas Recirculation (“EGR”) / Exhaust Heat Recovery Systems (“EHRS”) which can give over 3% CO2 savings. Electrification also drives demand for ultra-quiet vehicles and we have developed products to reduce engine noise through advanced exhaust line architecture, electric valves and resonance free pipes. _Sustainable Mobility – Solutions for ultra-low emission commercial and industrial vehicles: We are anticipating_ the ongoing emissionization of all commercial vehicles, particularly in growth markets like China and India, where regulations are converging towards European and North American standards. Technologies such as our heated doser contributes to ultra-low NOx emissions by operating efficiently even at lower temperatures and is compatible with current and future after treatment architectures. In 2018, we acquired Hug Engineering, the European leader in complete exhaust gas purification systems for high horsepower engines. In 2020, stringent regulations were implemented in all regions both for stationary and marine applications. In order to adapt to stricter emission regulations and to improve air quality, we developed “Electric Heated Catalyst” technology that will enable the emission control system in vehicles to reach its maximum efficiency at a faster pace. _Sustainable and smart materials: we design products taking into account their entire life cycle, from the use of_ resources and raw materials to their eco-design and recyclability at the end of their life. We offer bio-sourced materials that reduce the weight of parts and their carbon footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Sustainable Development,9.7.1,Ambition to be CO2 neutral for Controlled Emissions by 2030,"We are committed to tackling climate change and have launched an ambitious programme to become CO2 neutral for our Controlled Emissions by 2030. Through this program, we aim to both reduce our environmental impact and create long-term value across our entire supply chain. We are investing in innovation to advance the sustainability of our products and industrial processes across all of our businesses. 17 ----- We have developed a plan in three stages to achieve this goal. Our action plan has been reviewed and validated by Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”). Our plan was developed prior to the Hella Acquisition and is expected to be reviewed or revised ahead of our annual report for the year ended 31 December 2022, and released in 2023, to account for the closing of the Hella Acquisition and any impact it may have. - _By 2025: Internal Emissions: we aim to be CO2 neutral for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions across all of our sites. This will be achieved through using less energy and renewable energy either purchased or produced on sites. To reach our goals, we partner with experts and invest in energy-efficiency projects at our production facilities. - _By 2030:_ _Controlled Emissions: we aim to be CO2 neutral for our scope 3 emissions, excluding emissions of vehicles equipped with Faurecia products (“Controlled Emissions”). Controlled Emissions include emissions from upstream and downstream activities: purchases, lease, freight, travel, waste and recycling. This will be achieved through strong collaboration with our suppliers and the reorganization of our purchasing processes for low-carbon raw materials, in particular steel and plastics, product redesign and services such as transportation. - _By 2050: Total Emissions: we aim to be CO2 neutral for our total emissions as the whole industry moves towards zero-emissions mobility and a circular economy. We have also entered into a partnership with Schneider Electric, Engie and KPMG to develop an action plan to optimize energy sourcing and to use less energy and clean energy across our sites. This will involve on-site renewable energy production and external renewable energy sourcing. With the help of Engie and Schneider Electric, Faurecia undertook energy audits of around 140 sites at the end of 2021, with a view to identifying energy cost saving investments. The goal is to achieve fully decarbonized energy by 2025. In July 2021, we selected KPMG as our partner for on-site power purchase agreements advisory services. Under this partnership, we will benefit from KPMG’s expertise to prepare, execute and implement our solar panel equipment program across all facilities, worldwide, which is a step on our CO2 neutrality journey. We will delegate the installation and the operation of these renewable electricity production assets to third parties (“developers”), and KPMG will advise and support us to identify and contract the right developers. In September 2021, we also selected a Swedish steel maker SSAB, to partner for fossil-free high strength steel for use in our Seating business. This partnership makes us the first automotive supplier to explore fossil-free steel with SSAB and marks a major milestone on our CO2 neutrality journey. We aim to start equipping our seating structures with SSAB fossil-free steel from 2026 onwards. SSAB will provide us with the industry’s most ambitious and advanced fossil-free steel, using hydrogen and zero-carbon electricity instead of coking coal and other fossil fuels traditionally used to make steel. Under this partnership, we will develop, test, validate and industrialize ultra-low CO2 seat structures. While the long-term impact of the Covid-19 global pandemic on the automotive industry is still unclear, we believe that some trends are being accelerated, in particular powertrain electrification. We currently estimate that by 2030 approximately 30% of the market will be full electric vehicles and 37% of the market will be hybrid vehicles. We believe that our strategy is aligned with the needs of the automotive industry as we invest in fuel cell technology and our CO2 neutral initiative. In 2022, we commissioned a study to assess our industrial portfolio, including Hella’s portfolio, against multiple climate physical risks under different scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We are assessing the results and developing a plan.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Sustainable Development,9.7.3,,"The political and societal drive towards climate change has now reached the forefront of the agenda in many countries and regions of the world. The Green Deal in Europe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in 2030 and to have no net emissions in 2050 is a clear demonstration of this, as is the emphasis put on renewable energy in economic recovery plans. With transport accounting for around one quarter of global CO2 emissions and passenger vehicles accounting for around 10%, the automotive industry has a strong responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce its environmental impact. We believe these actions with respect to climate change present a number of opportunities for us. In September 2021, we joined _Entreprises pour _l’Environnement (EpE), a French association bringing together more than 60 French and international_ companies from all business sectors, willing to better include the environment in their strategy and business decisions. Sustainable development is fully integrated into our transformation strategy and corporate culture. Within this cultural framework, we have defined six convictions and six values that guide our actions and behaviours. Our six convictions form the basis of our corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) strategy, “Inspired to Care”, and our CSR roadmap. Our CSR roadmap is based on the following main projects: - _Achieving carbon neutrality by 2025, 2030 and 2050.

For more information, see “Forward-looking Statements”. This information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management and has not been audited or reviewed by Mazars or Ernst & Young Audit, nor have any procedures been performed by them with respect thereto. Our 2025 ambitions included herein are based on assumed annual worldwide automotive production of 88 million light vehicles by 2025 and includes the estimated impact from our divestment plan (see “—Divestment Plan” below). Elsewhere in this Offering Circular, our forecasts and estimates of worldwide automotive production, or other forecasts or estimates based thereon, have been calculated on the basis of S&P Global Mobility (formerly IHS Markit) forecasts that have been restated to exclude vehicles between 3.5 tons and 6_ 20 ----- _tons in Asia. For example, our 2022 guidance included under “—Third-Quarter 2022 Sales Results and 2022 Guidance” below assumes worldwide automotive production of approximately 77 million light vehicles, excluding such vehicles between 3.5 tons and 6 tons in Asia. Estimated worldwide automotive production would increase to approximately 80 million units if vehicles between 3.5 tons and 6 tons in Asia are included. Our 2025 ambitions contained in this section are prepared using S&P Global Mobility methodology without restatement, that is, without excluding vehicles between 3.5 tons and 6 tons in Asia. As a result, readers are cautioned to use care in comparing our 2025 ambitions with other predictions or estimates relating to worldwide automotive production._ For the upcoming years, we aim to focus on deleveraging through three financial priorities: (i) selective sales growth, (ii) cost reduction, and (iii) cash management. Our ambition is to deleverage to the extent that our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio reaches less than 1.5x by 2025. With respect to selective sales growth, our ambition is to reach approximately €30 billion in annual sales in 2025. To meet our target, for the period through 2025 we aim to: - adjust product mix to higher electronics content and reduced ICE exposure; - continue increases in the share of Electrified, Premium and SUVs in our product mix; and - continue growth in Asia, in particular China, which has outperformed the overall worldwide production level in recent years. We intend to allocate 60% of net cash flow to deleveraging our balance sheet, and the remaining 40% of net cash flow to dividends and share repurchases (mainly allocated to performance share plans, to avoid dilution for shareholders). With respect to reducing costs, our ambition is to reach an operating margin of more than 7% in 2025. To meet our target, for the period through 2025 we aim to: - rationalize and optimize our industrial footprint across business groups; - reach operational efficiency by reducing our manufacturing and operational costs (by more than 200 basis points between 2022 and 2025); - reduce gross R&D costs by 100 basis points between 2022 and 2025 and selling, general and administrative expenses by 60 basis points between 2022 and 2025; - control fixed costs while continuing to invest in electronics and sustainability; and - realize cost synergies and optimisations from the integration of Hella. With respect to cash management, our ambition is to reach net cash flow margin of 4% of sales by 2025. To meet our target, for the period through 2025 we aim to: - improve net cash flow generation; - maximise R&D efficiency by focusing on high return platforms; - reduce our working capital requirements (by at least 150 basis points in 2025 compared to 2022, including synergies with Hella) and capital expenditures (by 100 basis points in 2025 compared to 2022, including synergies with Hella); and - continue active management of financings to ensure optimized cost in the medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

By geographic region, for the third quarter of 2022: - _Europe – recorded sales of €2,647 million (40% of Forvia sales), representing 97.7% growth compared to the third quarter of 2021, or 28.5% without the contribution of Hella and excluding currency effects, driven particularly by organic growth in Seating, Interiors and Clean Mobility; - _North America – recorded sales of €1,728 million (26% of Forvia sales), representing 91.3% growth compared to the third quarter of 2021, or 26.5% without the contribution of Hella and excluding currency effects, driven particularly by organic growth in Seating, Interiors and Clean Mobility; - _Asia – recorded sales of €1,925 million (29% of Forvia sales), representing 92.5% growth compared to the third quarter of 2021, or 35.6% without the contribution of Hella and excluding currency effects, driven particularly by organic growth in Seating and sales of €1,566 million in China (representing organic growth in China of 38.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021); and 22 ----- - _Rest of the world – recorded sales of €292 million (5% of Forvia sales), representing 58.4% growth compared to the third quarter of 2021, or 44.4% without the contribution of Hella and excluding currency effects, driven particularly by sales in South America to Stellantis and Volkswagen. We revised our sales guidance expectations for the full year 2022 to between €24.5 billion and €25.5 billion (from €23 billion and €24 billion previously) to reflect the impact of currency effects (calculated by applying average currency rates for the period to the sales of the prior year) and an increase in our estimate of worldwide automotive production in 2022 to 77 million light vehicles (from 74 million light vehicles, previously). We continue to expect an operating margin of between 4% and 5% of sales and net cash flow at breakeven for the full year 2022. _The above guidance is based on full-year average currency rates of 1.05 for U.S. dollars to euros and of 7.07 for Chinese Yen to euros. It assumes no major lockdown impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region in the fourth quarter of 2022 and takes into account the Group’s latest update of the estimated net impact from cost inflation._",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Recent Developments,9.9.3,Shortage of electronics components,"The global shortage of semiconductors impacted the automotive industry in 2021. The impact was stronger in the second half of 2021, although in the first half the supply of semiconductors was also impacted by climatic conditions in Texas and a fire experienced by one of the major Japanese suppliers of semiconductors. Worldwide automotive production in 2021 amounted to 73.4 million light vehicles, an increase of only 3.8% year-on-year. The difficult situation in the second half of 2021, with a low point in the third quarter (only 15.8 million light vehicles were produced in the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 19% vs. the third quarter of 2020), strongly disrupted our customers’ activity during that period, which resulted in unprecedented high volatility in OEM programs and numerous and erratic production stops & gos for Faurecia. The volatility in OEM programs, which reached its peak in September and October 2021. The shortage of semiconductors has continued in the first half of 2022. Production of automobiles in Europe decreased a further 17.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 and 11.8% in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. Supply chain disruptions in Europe were also impacted by the war in Ukraine. In China, supply chain disruptions were further impacted by Covid-related restrictions implemented in April and May in the Shanghai and Changchun areas, with automotive production up only 1.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, worldwide automotive production in the first half of 2022 decreased by 0.6% compared to the first half of 2021, to 37.2 million light vehicles (down 6 million light vehicles or 14% compared to the 43.3 million light vehicles produced in the first half of 2019, prior to the Covid pandemic and supply chain disruptions).",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Recent Developments,9.9.4,Divestment Plan,"In April 2022 we announced a program to dispose of certain non-strategic assets by the end of 2023, as part of the Group’s plan to reduce its consolidated net debt following the Hella Acquisition. We have identified nonstrategic assets with a combined estimated value of over €1 billion for divestment. On 28 July 2022, Hella announced the first significant step in the Group’s divestment program: the divestment of its 33% stake in the joint venture in HBPO Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH (“HBPO”) to its co-shareholder, Plastic Omnium for a purchase price of approximately €290 million. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals, with a closing expected in the fourth quarter of 2022. The divestment of HBPO represents close to 30% of the total target for the divestment plan. We expect to announce at least one further divestment by the end of 2022, and announce the remaining divestments under the program by mid-2023 in order to close such transactions by the end of 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Recent Developments,9.9.5,Combining Faurecia and Hella,"Our business combination with Hella marks a step in our ambition to accelerate our strategic transformation, investing in fast-growing segments with leading positions. The Hella Acquisition is a strategic opportunity for us, enabling us to create the world’s seventh largest supplier to the automotive industry, with a cutting-edge technology portfolio that addresses the major trends in the industry, and to achieve the combination of two 23 ----- highly complementary companies focused on innovation, operational excellence, customer satisfaction and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”). We completed the Hella Acquisition on 31 January 2022 (the “Completion Date”) with the settlement of transactions representing an investment by us of €5.4 billion and a total enterprise value of €6.7 billion for 100% of Hella. On the Completion Date, we purchased 88,329,028 shares representing 79.5% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella, including the purchase of 66,666,669 shares representing 60% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella (the “Block Trade”) from family shareholders of Hella having concluded a pooling agreement between them (the “Family Pool”) and the settlement of a voluntarily public takeover offer pursuant to Section 29 (1) of the German Takeover Act (Übernahmeangebot) for 21,662,359 shares tendered, representing 19.5% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella (the “Public Tender Offer” and, together with the Block Trade, the “Hella Acquisition”). We also, as of 31 March 2022, purchased 2,327,078 shares of Hella (which includes 77,580 shares of Hella acquired from the Family Pool) in open-market or off-market transactions, representing 2.09% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella. As a result of the above, we held 81.59% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella as of 31 March 2022. With our 81.59% interest in Hella, we are now the controlling shareholder of Hella, given the legal status of Hella as a GmbH &Co. KGaA, which has allowed us to begin, from the Completion Date, to implement our strategy for integrating Hella to benefit from cost synergies and optimized operations. Hella will continue to be a listed company with its own governance, and has been fully consolidated into Faurecia’s financial accounts since 1 February 2022. As part of the Hella Acquisition, and following discussions with Hella and the members of the Family Pool, we had agreed in August 2021 to the following: - the BCA, under the terms of which we undertook, among other things, to launch the Public Tender Offer for all of Hella’s shares at a price of €60.00 per share, amounting to total consideration of €60.96 per share (which includes a dividend of €0.96 according to a resolution by the Hella shareholders at their annual general meeting on 30 September 2021 and paid by Hella to all its shareholders prior to the Completion Date), which corresponds to a premium of 33% compared to the latest unaffected share price of €45.8 as of 26 April 2021 and of 24% compared to the unaffected 3-month volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of €49.10 prior to 27 April 2021; and - the Hella Acquisition Agreement, and the Investment Agreement (as amended on 21 January 2022), under the terms of which we undertook to purchase the entire stake held by the Family Pool in the Block Trade of 66,666,669 shares of Hella, representing 60% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella, at a price of €60.00 per share, paid through a combination of: (i) €3.4 billion in cash (i.e., 57,153,018 shares in Hella at €60.00 per share), (ii) 13,571,385 of our ordinary shares (such shares were issued in accordance with the existing capital increase authorizations granted by our shareholders at their meeting on 31 May 2021; the exchange ratio was determined based on a one-day VWAP trading price of €38.635 per share on the last trading day of Faurecia shares on Euronext Paris immediately before the Completion Date, at which price such shares were valued at €524.3 million) and (iii) €46.2 million (i.e., the remainder of the 770,676 shares in Hella held by the Family Pool at €60.00 per share). As a result, the Family Pool became our largest shareholder with approximately 9% of our share capital, subject to an 18-month lock-up agreement. Dr. Jürgen Behrend was appointed as a Family Pool representative to the Faurecia Board of Directors and his appointment was confirmed at our Combined General Meeting of 1 June 2022, emphasizing the Family Pool’s strong commitment to the Group’s strategy and outlook. Pursuant to the Public Tender Offer, Hella’s shareholders were permitted under the German Takeover Act (Übernahmeangebot) to tender their shares in Hella starting on 27 September 2021 until 11 November 2021 (the “Public Tender Offer Expiration Date”). We published the final results on https://www.faureciaoffer.com following the Public Tender Offer Expiration Date, and we settled the Public Tender Offer on the Completion Date for cash consideration of €1.3 billion. The Hella Acquisition was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors at a meeting held on 9 August 2021, and received the support of Hella’s management. The Group focuses on four growth areas, fully aligned with automotive key trends: 24 ----- - Electric Mobility (including hydrogen solutions), - ADAS & Autonomous Driving, - Cockpit of the Future, and - Life-Cycle Solutions. We believe that with approximately 2,650 software and data engineers the Group is positioned to become a major technological player in the automotive electronics and software fields. We view the strategic rationale for the Hella Acquisition as follows: (1) _Combining Faurecia with Hella’s strong identity, businesses and employees. We value the technology and innovations of Hella and we intend to further enhance and globalize their activities. The Hella Acquisition is an opportunity for our companies to accelerate our technological transformation, achieve critical size and leading positions in Electronics (aiming for more than €6.3 billion of sales by 2025) and Life-Cycle Solutions. Hella has established three business groups (Electronics, Lighting and Lifecyle Solutions), headquartered in Lippstadt, Germany. Our objective is to leverage Hella’s talents to achieve profitable growth for the Group. We believe that stability in Hella’s management and their continued involvement is a key factor in integrating successfully into one Group. (2) _Establishing ourselves as the seventh largest global automotive technology supplier focused on fast- _growing automotive technologies, with leading positions and with a significantly increased ‘powertrain-agnostic’ share of revenues by:_ - _Developing a strong and focused offer for Electric Mobility (BEV and FCEV). The Group aims to develop a comprehensive offer for electric vehicles (HEVs, PHEVs, BEVs and FCEVs), building on Hella’s energy management portfolio, sensors and actuators related to BEVs, as well as our hydrogen system solutions (FCEV) and hybrid systems. The Group’s product offering, may include, for instance, Hella’s battery management systems, DC/DC converters, onboard charging systems combined with our battery pack systems, hydrogen storage systems and stack systems. With such a portfolio of solutions, the Group plans to be uniquely positioned to benefit from the zero emissions mobility market transition, in particular with a view to decreasing internal-combustion engine (“ICE”) sales exposure from less than 20% at the Completion Date and down to approximately 10% in 2025. - _Becoming a major player in Electronics and Software solutions to accelerate in ADAS & _Autonomous Driving. In ADAS & Autonomous Driving systems, we aim to create a strong_ global player supporting the next high-speed and low-speed ADAS convergence with the combination of Faurecia Clarion Electronics with Hella Electronics and Software. The Group’s products on offer may include, for instance, radars, electric power steering (including fail operational systems features, meaning the device can operate even in case of failure), e-mirrors, 360° views and automated parking solutions. The Group operates 24 production sites and 21 R&D centers in the new electronics business group combining Faurecia Clarion Electronics with Hella Electronics and Software. The ambition of the Group, with orders already significantly booked, is to grow sales to more than €6.3 billion in 2025. - _Boosting Faurecia’s Cockpit of the Future strategy thanks to complementary portfolios. Our leading positions in Seating and Interiors (including SAS) combined with Hella’s leading position in Interior Lighting and both companies’ Electronics should significantly strengthen our Cockpit of the Future strategy. Hella’s interior HMI (Human Machine Interface) solution capabilities, its portfolio of body electronics (access, comfort, seat), sensors and actuators will support value creation through new customer experiences. - _Creating a Life-Cycle Solutions activity, in line with environmental concerns and industry _evolutions. The Hella Acquisition will bring opportunities to build a real life-cycle solutions_ offer, including Aftermarket, Services & Repairs and Special Applications. We believe it will 25 ----- be able to enhance well-established Hella brands. It will allow to leverage potential business in eco-design products, sustainable materials and circular economy. (3) _Accelerating innovation with strong R&D capabilities. We expect to expand innovation and R&D projects through a combined total of approximately 300 industrial sites, approximately 75 R&D centers and approximately 150,000 people, including more than 35,000 engineers and specialists, across more than 40 countries. With six business groups with 24 product lines and a strong IP portfolio of over 14,400 patents, we aim to be the preferred innovation and integration partner for OEMs worldwide. (4) _Capitalizing on complementary customer portfolios across all geographies and leveraging Faurecia’s _strong position in Asia, particularly in China. The Hella Acquisition has brought together two_ companies with established and complementary positions. It will open new sales opportunities for Hella by leveraging our privileged access to key Chinese and Japanese OEMs. We believe Hella’s position with German OEMs will contribute to improving our inroads with German OEMs. We believe that we and Hella will both benefit from complimentary strength with US-based OEMs. (5) _Generating significant synergies to drive profitability and cash generation improvement. We_ estimate that cost synergies and optimization, including procurement, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses and other operating expenses, should generate more than €250 million adjusted EBITDA estimated run-rate cost savings, with an 80% income statement impact to be achieved in 2024, although we also anticipate integration and implementation costs of approximately €250 million. Management believes that the profit and loss impact should gradually ramp up from 2023 through 2025 and for sales synergies to generate between €300 million and €400 million of estimated sales starting in approximately 2025, capitalizing on our strong footprint in China, Japan and the Americas to sell the Hella brand and on Hella’s position with German OEMs to enhance our market share. In addition to these synergies, estimated cash flow optimization by approximately €200 million per year on average from 2022 to 2025 will be generated mainly through working capital and capital expenditures. (6) _Leveraging common ESG commitments and priorities. Both companies share strong values, including ESG approaches involving ambitious CO2 neutrality roadmaps. The Group is a driving force in the decarbonation and sustainability of mobility. We secured the financing for the cash portion of the Hella Acquisition Price through up to €5.5 billion in Bridge Facilities under the Bridge Facility Agreement signed with a syndicate of international banks. We drew down €2.9 billion from the Bridge Facilities to finance the cash portion of the Hella Acquisition Price. Approximately €2.2 billion remained outstanding under the Bridge Facilities as at 30 June 2022, of which €500 million corresponded to the three-year Term Loan A Bridge Facility and €1.7 billion corresponded to the Term Loan B Bridge Facility and Term Loan C Bridge Facility, collectively, following the partial repayment of the Term Loan C Bridge Facility in June 2022 using the proceeds of a €705 million capital increase in June 2022. Approximately €1.7 billion remains outstanding under the Bridge Facilities as at the date of this Offering Circular following partial repayments of the Bridge Facilities using (i) the proceeds of the EIB Loan, supplemented by cash from our balance sheet, and (ii) the proceeds of the Latin American Syndicated Loan. As of 30 June 2022, on an adjusted basis after giving effect to this Offering, the borrowings under the Latin American Syndicated Loan and the EIB Loan and the use of the proceeds therefrom and cash on balance sheet to partially repay the Bridge Facilities, we had ample liquidity of €6.2 billion, including €4.2 billion of available cash and €2.0 billion collectively from the Secured Credit Facility and the Hella Credit Facility, each fully undrawn.

The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including as a result of: - the temporary or lasting disruption of production chains in the various countries affected by the pandemic; - the global demand for vehicles (new ways of working, etc.); - the health impacts on the wellbeing and availability of our employees and service providers, particularly in our factories and R&D centers; and - the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our financial performance (sales, operating margin and cash in particular), the consequences of which have included, and may continue to include, the partial or total shutdown of production sites, which has led, and may continue to lead, to delays in the execution of contracts, or the postponement of decisions regarding the placing of orders, or even their cancellation. The effects of the Covid19 pandemic have materially impacted our sales in the year ended 31 December 2021 and, particularly due to Covid-related restrictions in China, the six months ended 30 June 2022, and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our sales.

The Green Deal in Europe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in 2030 and to have no net emissions in 2050 is a clear demonstration of this, as is the emphasis put on renewable energy in economic recovery plans. With transport accounting for around one quarter of global CO2 emissions and passenger vehicles accounting for around 10%, the automotive industry has a strong responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce its environmental impact. Climate change, and businesses’ response to its emerging threats, are under increasing scrutiny by governments, regulators and the public alike. We face various risks associated with climate change including increasing levels of regulation, changes in consumer behaviour and the potential impact of increases in extreme weather events. The automotive sector is subject to increasing regulatory constraints related to CO2 emissions including, in particular, European Regulation 2019/631, which provides for additional reductions in CO2 emissions of passenger vehicles by 37.5% from 2021 to 2030. In addition, the automotive sector may be strongly impacted in the future by the introduction of stricter regulations on climate issues, particularly in the area of vehicle life cycle analysis. Regulations on the life cycle carbon footprint of vehicles would have a direct impact on the products and solutions that we provide. Our greenhouse gas emissions footprint consists of our direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2, respectively), and mostly from our controlled upstream and downstream value chain (scope 3), as well as from our purchasing activities. To accelerate the climate transition, public authorities are expected to constrain total footprint with new taxes and regulations. In addition, more extensive regulations aimed at reducing emissions of NOx in urban areas and CO2 globally could lead to an increase in demand for vehicles that pollute less. Consumer behaviour may also evolve as a result of greater environmental awareness, encouraging new models of mobility and vehicle ownership as well as the purchase of more ecofriendly vehicles. Finally, extreme weather-related events (such as floods, cyclones and storms) may impact production facilities located near rivers or basins, which could disrupt production and thereby lead to customer delays and, potentially, loss of business. Failure to anticipate, identify and manage risks associated with climate transition could have a significant impact on our financial condition, business and reputation. Furthermore, our operations may be interrupted due to the loss, closure or suspension of our production facilities, whether as a result of extreme weather-related events or failure to comply with more stringent regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Operations,13.1.3,Our business is dependent on the automotive sector and the commercial success of the models for which we supply components.,"Given that we specialize in the manufacture of original equipment for our automaker customers, our business is directly related to vehicle production levels of these customers in their markets. The cyclical nature that characterizes our customers’ businesses can have a significant impact on our sales and results. The level of sales and production for each of our customers depends on numerous parameters, notably the general level of consumption of goods and services in a given market, confidence levels of participants in that market, buyers’ ability to access credit for vehicle purchases, and in some cases, governmental aid programs (such as the financial support provided to the automotive sector and incentives introduced for the purchase of vehicles). Our sales are directly linked to the performance of the automotive industry in the major geographic regions where we and our customers operate, especially in Europe (which constituted 44.8% of our sales in 2021), Asia (which constituted 26.7% of our sales in 2021) and North America (which constituted 23.8% of our sales in 2021). Our sales are also related to the commercial success of the models for which we produce components and modules. At the end of a vehicle’s life cycle, there is significant uncertainty around whether our products will be taken up again for the replacement model. In addition, orders placed with us are open orders without any guarantees of minimum volumes and are generally based on the life of the vehicle model concerned. There can be no guarantee that our products will be utilized for the replacement model, and we could therefore be required to make certain investments in supply contracts that may not be offset by customer order volumes, which would generate a significant impact on our operating income. A shift in market share away from the vehicles 37 ----- for which we produce components and modules (and in particular, internal combustion engine vehicles) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

We cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our customers may not be able to honor certain contracts or may suffer financial difficulties. In addition, changes in the automotive sector could accelerate the concentration of automakers, ultimately resulting in the disappearance of certain brands or vehicle models for which we produce equipment. Our major customers could also face a slowdown in activity, including as a result of the potential impact of increased regulatory scrutiny of emissions tests, among other factors. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

As of 31 December 2021, we have made purchases consumed (i.e., goods purchased that have been consumed during the production cycle, such as raw materials and parts, and indirectly, excluding purchases of monoliths) of €11.5 billion from approximately 19,000 suppliers. If one or more of our main suppliers were to go bankrupt, or experience an unforeseen stock-out, quality problems, social unrest, a strike or any other incident disrupting the supplies for which it is committed to us, this could negatively impact our image or production output or lead to additional costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have been and could be impacted in the future in the event of supplier failures, for example, following a major disaster impacting a supplier’s production sites, a health crisis, production quality issues, delivery of less than required quantities or a shortage of certain raw materials or components, such as electronic components. We are also subject to negative impacts as a result of disruptions to suppliers in the global value chain. The global value chain has in the past experienced disruptions as the result of a general lack of production capacity for certain raw materials or components, such as the current shortage of semiconductors. Such shortages may be further exacerbated by climatic events, such as the winter storms in Texas, or other external factors, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and fires in Japan that have disrupted the production of semiconductors. In addition, global economic recovery, such as the recovery from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, has created and may continue to create pressure on demand for raw materials or components, which may result in a disruption to production further down the global value chain. In addition, if we or one of our suppliers or service providers default at any stage of the manufacturing process, or if we are no longer able to purchase such raw materials or components in sufficient quantities or at sufficiently affordable prices to meet existing customer orders, we may be held liable for failure to fulfil our contractual obligations or for technical problems. In such a case, we may also be required to pay compensation related to the difficulty of continuing current projects. Disruptions in supply chains or a decline in the volume of vehicles produced by global carmakers as a result of tension in supply and logistics chains would have a material adverse effect on our business, turnover, sales, financial situation, financial results, outlook and share price.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

If the software provided by our suppliers is defective, the product may not function as intended. In particular, a number of our products, including infotainment, Android system embedded applications and wireless chargers that connect with smartphones, include embedded software which is obtained from third-party providers. Should we, or one of 38 ----- our suppliers or service providers, default at any stage of the manufacturing process or provide a defective service, we could be held liable for failure to fulfil our contractual obligations or for any technical problems that may arise. In addition, any actual or alleged instances of inferior product quality, or of damage caused or allegedly caused by our products, could damage our reputation and brand and could lead to new or existing customers becoming less willing to conduct business with us.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

Each contract we make with a customer is a program with a lifespan of up to ten years from the development phase through to the production phase. As part of the tender process, we carry out a detailed risk assessment to ensure that we identify and manage the nature and level or risks that we may be exposed to and, during the life of the program, we monitor the program in order to ensure operational and financial performance. In 2021, we managed approximately 800 programs on a permanent basis. If we fail to identify and manage risks in connection with the bidding for and establishment of new programs, or fail to appropriately monitor our operational and financial performance, our gross margins could be adversely affected, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

The loss or unavailability of our senior management team or key personnel for an extended period of time could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we could experience difficulties in attracting and retaining the necessary talent able to provide the skills required for the development or production of our products and services, particularly if the automotive industry is considered less attractive to younger generations. Moreover, we compete with other companies for suitably qualified personnel, including technical and engineering personnel. If management or key positions remain unfilled for too long, if turnover rates are too high or if diversity is insufficient, the level of motivation and productivity of our teams, as well as the cost of recruiting, training and integrating new employees, could be impacted.

These may result in particular from heightened geopolitical tensions (including those between the U.S. and China and between Russia and Ukraine), regional instability or the imposition of trade barriers and protectionist policies in various countries. As of 30 June 2022, we operated in more than 40 countries and generated 46.1% of our sales in Europe, 24.2% in Asia, 25.6% in North America and 4.2% in the rest of the world. Our international business activities, notably in emerging countries, are exposed to certain risks inherent in any activity carried out overseas, including: - any potential amendments to laws or regulations, or to commercial, monetary or fiscal policies applied in certain foreign countries and, in particular, risks of expropriation and nationalization; - customs regulations, monetary control policies, investment restrictions or requirements or any other constraints such as levies or other forms of taxation on settlements and other payment terms adopted by subsidiaries; - difficulties in enforcing agreements, collecting payments due and protecting property through foreign legal systems, in particular, where intellectual property protection is less stringent; and - supply chain tensions and their consequences. Inadequate planning or preparations for regulatory decisions or changes made to legal requirements could have a significant negative impact on our business, finances and results of operations. For example, the government authorities in a country in which we operate could update standards that apply to our products, which could have negative consequences on our operating income. In addition, our business is affected by general economic conditions and macroeconomic trends which can impact overall demand for our products and the markets in which we operate including, for example, inflation and trade tensions between the EU and the U.S. and between the U.S. and China. Furthermore, any weakening in economic conditions may affect the automotive supply industry globally, and negative economic conditions in one or more regions may affect the automotive supply industry in other regions. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by an economic downturn on a global scale or in significant markets in which we operate. These risks may be further exacerbated by macroeconomic trends and developments, such as trade tensions between various countries and regions, which could lead to unfavorable changes in trade policies that apply to our products.

Competition is based mainly on price, global presence, technology, quality, delivery, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and customer service as a whole. There are no guarantees that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors. Supply contracts are mostly awarded through competitive bids, and are often 40 ----- subject to renewed bidding when their terms expire. Although the overall number of competitors has decreased due to on-going industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets that we serve. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete favorably in these competitive markets or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation by reducing our ability to increase or maintain sales and profit margins. The failure to obtain new business projects on new models, or to retain or increase business projects on redesigned existing models, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as a result of the relatively long lead times required for many of our structural components, it may be difficult for us to adequately manage the execution of a program from development to launch, adequately respond to any deterioration in the profitability of a program or to obtain new revenues in the short-term to replace any unexpected decline in the sale of existing products.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

Our variable rate financial debt relates primarily to the Senior Credit Facility, when drawn, the Bridge Facilities, the EIB Loan and the Latin American Syndicated Loan, as well as our short-term debt. Our main fixed rate debt consists of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2027 Sustainability-Linked Notes, the 2028 Notes, the 2029 Green Notes, the Schuldscheindarlehen. We manage hedging of interest rate risks centrally. This management is handled by our Finance and Treasury Department, which reports to our General Management. Interest rate hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis. Since a significant part of our borrowings are at variable rates, the aim of our interest rate hedging policy is to reduce the impact of short-term rate changes on earnings. Our hedges primarily comprise euro-denominated interest rate swaps. They hedge a part of our interest payable in 2022 and 2023 against a rise in interest rates. Our interest rate position with respect to the different types of financial instruments used is detailed in note 30.3 to our audited 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements.

The proportion of our direct purchases of raw materials, mainly steel 42 ----- and thermoplastic resins, and the raw materials share of indirect purchases of components made of these same raw materials, represented approximately 40% of purchases in 2021. The prices of these raw materials are subject to fluctuations, the underlying causes of which are linked to structural supply capacity, demand, international geopolitical relations and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our operating and net income could be adversely affected by changes in the prices of the raw materials we use, notably steel and plastics. To the extent that our sales contracts with customers do not include price indexation clauses linked to the price of raw materials, we are exposed to risks related to unfavorable fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use derivatives to hedge our purchases of raw materials or energy. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has added pressure on raw materials supplies with a potential impact on their prices, including risks related to shortages of semiconductors (which are present in a number of our products) that are expected to continue through part or all of 2022 at a minimum. If commodity prices were to rise steeply, we may not be able to pass on all such price increases to our customers, which could have an unfavorable impact on our sales and which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to secure a sufficient quantity of semiconductors, we could be exposed to operational losses as well as client claims seeking indemnification. Bottlenecks in the value chain, which are mainly the result of a general shortage of certain electronic components and have been amplified by external factors over which we have limited control, could result in higher costs of transportation, raw materials, energy, workforce and quality assurance, for example, which may affect our financial results.

Although the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, this conflict has and could continue to disrupt markets, including significant volatility in commodity prices, financial markets, supply chain interruptions, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and espionage. We have operated and continue to operate certain sites in Russia, including an industrial site in Togliatti in the Samara region that we opened in 2021, and generated sales in Russia of approximately €200 million in 2021, representing 1.3% of our total sales. Hella generated sales in Russia of less than €50 million in 2021, representing less than 0.5% of Hella’s total sales. We do not have direct operations or material sales in Ukraine, although Ukraine is a major exporter of wire harnesses used in the production of automobiles. The conflict in the region has had and could continue to have a direct impact on our operations and sales in Russia, and has also had an indirect impact on automotive production globally. Continuation of the conflict could lead to further supply chain disruptions and may have a material adverse impact on demand for our products. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted global energy markets, particularly in Europe, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas and other energy supplies. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities, in the expense of shipping raw materials to our facilities, and in the expense of shipping products. Russia’s annexation of portions of Ukraine and military action against Ukraine have led to sanctions being levied by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries targeting persons and entities in Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine, including, among others, removing certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) payment system, which can significantly hinder the ability to transfer funds in and out of Russia. In response, Russia has instituted counter-sanctions against such countries. The situation is rapidly evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries may implement additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia or other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories.

We have experienced major accidents in the past, such as fires, flooding and explosions, and although we have extensive health and safety policies in place, we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent future industrial accidents at our plants or R&D centers in the future. In addition, some of our plants are highly specialized in terms of manufacturing, and it would be difficult to set up alternative solutions within a short period of time in the event of a major accident. Our industrial activities and use of a large number of potentially polluting products and materials in the context of the product production process expose us to environmental risks, such as the risk of accidental pollution and other risks related to the tightening of environmental regulations. We may also be exposed to operational risks related to poor energy management (such as generating excessive CO2 emissions) or poor management of raw materials or waste. Any failure to comply with environmental regulations could cause damage to our reputation and generate a significate financial impact, including in the form of criminal law sanctions or lost opportunities. Accidental pollution could also force us to pay considerably for the decontamination of the sites impacted. In addition, as part of our production activities, our personnel are exposed to a variety of risks, including accidents, occupational illnesses or illnesses related to the workplace environment in general that may affect their health or physical safety. If our personnel were to experience harm in the workplace, our business, reputation and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Moreover, the occurrence of any natural disaster could cause the total or partial destruction of a plant and thus prevent us from supplying products to our customers, causing further disruption at their plants for an indeterminate period of time.

While we try to ensure that our suppliers maintain the reputation of our brand, suppliers may take actions that adversely affect our reputation. In 2021, we worked with more than 19,000 suppliers in 63 countries. Due to this large number of suppliers, we may be unable to exclude, and may not be aware of, the existence of improper practices at these suppliers with respect to compliance with environmental standards, business ethics, employment law or human and fundamental rights. If one of our suppliers has failed, or is suspected of having failed, to comply with environmental standards, business ethics, employment law or human and fundamental rights, or if our integrity on these issues is called into doubt, we may experience significant consequences to our reputation, business activity and financial position. In addition, through the increased use of social media, individuals and non-governmental organizations have the ability to disseminate their opinions regarding the safety of our products, and our business, to an increasingly wide audience at a faster pace.

The Group is exposed to sanctions in the event of any non-compliance with any such regulations. In addition, given the specific nature of the automotive sector (in particular, the presence of a reduced number of stakeholders in certain markets), the Group may also be exposed to antitrust risks (for example, cartel arrangements). There can be no assurance that violations of such regulations will not occur.

For example, in 2020, Faurecia completed the acquisitions of (i) the Canadian company IRYStec Inc., which specializes in display technologies, and (ii) SAS, a major player in the assembly and logistics of complex modules for vehicle interiors. In 2021, Faurecia also acquired (i) the Russian company ACP, specialized in the production of vehicle interior systems in the Togliatti region, (ii) the UK company Design Led, specialized in advanced backlighting technologies, and (iii) CLD, one of the main Chinese producers of hydrogen reservoirs, based in Shenyang. In August 2021, Faurecia announced its proposed business combination with the German company Hella. The Hella Acquisition was completed on 31 January 2022, following the acquisition of 60% of Hella’s shares from its family shareholders and the voluntary cash tender offer launched by Faurecia on 27 September 2021 at the end of which Faurecia acquired an additional 19.5% of Hella’s shares. As of 30 June 2022, Faurecia held 81.59% of the share capital of Hella. Hella’s sales for the period from 1 February 2022 through 30 June 2022 during which it was consolidated in Forvia’s financial results represented 24% of the Group’s consolidated sales for the six months ended 30 June 2022 (for more information on the acquisition, see “Recent Developments— _Combining Faurecia and Hella”)._ There are several risks inherent to acquisitions which could occur, including, in particular: - risk of overestimation of the target value; - risk of the anticipated synergies being significantly delayed or not being achieved; - risk of not succeeding in integrating the acquired companies and their technologies, product ranges and employees; - risk of departure of key employees; - risk of higher than expected costs related to the integration of acquired companies; - risks related to suppliers or customers, or the loss of contracts resulting in costly or unfavorable financial conditions; - existence of new specific risks within the target including risks the Group failed to identify during the due diligence investigations (tax, environmental, ethics, legal, etc.); - risk of increased indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition or refinance the debt of the target. In addition, due to the nature and the date of the Hella Acquisition closing (i.e., an acquisition of a listed company, involving several antitrust review processes) we only had access to Hella’s public financial 47 ----- information upon the closing of the Hella Acquisition on 31 January 2022. This date did not allow for a detailed review of potential changes of accounting policies and further impacts on Hella’s financial statements, in particular the amortization period of tangible and intangible assets, as well as the treatment of certain study costs related to customer programs. The benefits expected from future or completed acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time frames and/or at the levels expected and, consequently, may significantly affect our business, financial position and results of operations. The expected benefits of the Hella Acquisition in particular depend upon the successful integration of Hella’s activities. We could face significant difficulties implementing an integration plan, some of which may have been unforeseeable or outside of our control or the control of Hella, notably with respect to differences in norms, controls, procedures and rules, corporate culture, the history of technological investments and our organization and Hella, and the need to integrate and harmonize the various operating systems and procedures that are specific to each group, such as financial and accounting systems and other IT systems. The costs we incur in integrating Hella or trying to realize anticipated synergies may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit.

You will therefore not have any direct claim on the cash flows or assets of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, and the Issuer’s subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments. Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary, including lenders and trade creditors, will effectively have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the rights of its ordinary shareholders, including the Issuer.

Although holders of Notes should in principle be",13.4.1,Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.,"We are subject to complex and evolving tax legislation in the countries in which we operate. Changes in tax laws or regulations or in their interpretation could adversely affect our tax position, such as our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on 7 June 2017, and ratified by France on 26 September 2018, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the member states. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on 12 July 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on 29 May 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD **2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from 1 January 2020. Among the set of proposed measures, the ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3,000,000, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such new rules apply since 1 January 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 20181317 of 28 December 2018) (the “French Finance Law for 2019”) of the general interest limitation rule provided for by the ATAD. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of 28 December 2019) (the “French Finance Law for 2020”) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Code général des _impôts (the “FTC”). See “—Risks Related to the Notes—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility,_ 55 ----- _for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France on our indebtedness, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on this rule._ In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on 25 October 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies' taxable profits in the European Union, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between European Union countries and non-European Union countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. On 18 May 2021 the European Commission communicated a new plan called Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (“BEFIT”) which aims to replace the CCCTB in the European tax policy proposals. BEFIT is based mainly on the framework of the OECD's international tax reform project, and would involve the consolidation of the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to Member States using a formula, to be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and will give rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. The Commission’s aim is to introduce BEFIT into EU legislation by 2023. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes – the European Commission having made public a proposed directive on 22 December 2021 which once adopted, should be transposed by European member states prior to 30 June 2023 and then enter into force on 1 January 2024, (ii) adopt a recommendation on the domestic treatment of losses and (iii) make a legislative proposal creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”). On 8 October 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the Inclusive Framework) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the 140 Inclusive Framework members. The Two-Pillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar Two. Pillar One aims at ensuring a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located. Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the GloBE rules). On 20 December 2021, the OECD published the pillar two model rules (the “Model Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October 2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE rules into domestic legislation. They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii) determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the top-up tax. On 22 December 2021, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a Directive setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups. The draft Directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 member states the Model Rules that include an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the European Union fundamental freedoms. In addition, the draft Directive makes use of an option contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby the member state of a low-taxed income entity (referred as constituent entity) applying the IIR is required to ensure effective 56 ----- taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities residents in that member State. The proposal will move to the negotiation phase among the Member States with the aim of reaching a final agreement; the European Commission proposes that the member states shall transpose the Directive into their national laws by 21 December 2022 for the rules to come into effect as of 1 January 2023 (with the exception of the UTPR, for which the application will be deferred to 1 January 2024). The development of model legislation, a Multilateral Convention and a multilateral instrument for the implementation of the Two-Pillar Solution are expected to be finalized on 2022 in order the Two-Pillar Solution to be effective on 2023. Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since 1 January 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of 10 October 2017 into French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our rental offerings and services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

By exception, Article 212, I-(a) of the FTC provides that interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the FTC or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial institutions in similar conditions. Moreover, under article 212 bis of the FTC, for financial years opened as from 1 January 2019, net financial expenses (“NFE”) are deductible up to the highest of €3,000,000 per financial year and 30% of the borrower’s adjusted EBITDA, corresponding to its taxable result before offset of tax losses and without taking into consideration tax, NFE and, to some extent, depreciation, amortization, provisions and capital gain/losses (subject to several exceptions). The NFE are defined as the excess, if any, of the financial expenses of the borrower over its financial income. If the borrower belongs to a consolidated group, and its ratio of own funds to aggregated assets is equal to or higher than the corresponding ratio of the group, then 75% of any non-deducted NFE, under the above rule, becomes deductible. If the borrower has a ratio of affiliated debts to own funds which exceeds 1.5, it is viewed as thinly capitalized, and the deduction of the NFE is governed by the following specific limitations: the portion of the NFE related to the affiliated debts which exceeds 1.5 times the borrower’s own funds is deductible up to the highest of the pro-rated €1,000,000 per financial year and 10% of the pro-rated EBITDA; the portion of the NFE related to the non-affiliated debts, and to the affiliated debts which do not exceed 1.5 times the borrower’s own funds, is deductible up to the highest of the pro-rated €3,000,000 per financial year and 30% of the pro-rated EBITDA. These specific limitations do not apply if the ratio of affiliated debts to own funds of the borrower is lower or equal to the corresponding ratio of the consolidated group to which it belongs. The portion of the NFE which is non-deductible, in respect of a given financial year, may be carried forward indefinitely and deducted from the subsequent financial years subject to the same limitations (in case of thinly capitalized entities, only one third of the NFE may be carried forward). Also if a portion of a deductibility 57 ----- capacity, in respect of a given financial year, is not fully used by the borrower (other than a thinly capitalized one), it may be carried forward to the next 5 financial years. Special rules apply to the NFE related to public infra structure projects and to members of French tax consolidated groups. In addition, the French Finance Law for 2020 has implemented into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which are applicable as from 1 January 2020, except for certain of its provisions which are applicable since 1 January 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the FTC (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. Articles 205 B et seq. of the FTC implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Unlike the previous domestic anti-hybrid rules, payments made to tax-exempt or low-taxed beneficiaries are not within the scope of the new rules that only target differences in qualification or attribution of the right to tax an element of income. Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from 1 January 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the FTC, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the European financial transaction tax, if adopted.","On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive for a common Financial Transaction Tax (the “FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “Participating Member States”). The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt. In a common declaration dated 8 December 2015, the Participating Member States, excluding Estonia which ultimately indicated its withdrawal from the enhanced cooperation in March 2016, confirmed their intention to make decisions regarding the outstanding issues related to the FTT before the end of June 2016. Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State.

At the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (“ECOFIN”) meeting of 14 June 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on 7 June 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States (excluding Estonia) to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval. However, the Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.

We have set an ambitious goal of being CO2 neutral for our Controlled Emissions by 2030. We are investing in innovation to advance the sustainability of our business as we aim to both reduce our environmental impact and create long-term value across our entire supply chain. We estimate that approximately one-in-two vehicles globally are equipped with at least one of our products. On 31 January 2022, we completed the Hella Acquisition. This acquisition is a strategic opportunity enabling us to create the world’s seventh largest supplier to the automotive industry with a cutting-edge technology portfolio that addresses the major trends in the industry. Following the acquisition, we rebranded ourselves with a new trade name, “Forvia”, although Faurecia and Hella are expected to continue to operate as separate legal companies and market products under their own brands, collaborating closely and aiming to create sustainable value for all stakeholders through technology solutions and synergies generated in the best interest of both companies. For further details regarding the Hella Acquisition see “—Recent Developments—Combining _Faurecia and Hella” below._ Faurecia is organised in four business groups: Faurecia Clean Mobility, Faurecia Seating, Faurecia Interiors and Faurecia Clarion Electronics.

Connectivity will allow continuous monitoring of vehicles and passengers, the ability to upgrade software in vehicles and will provide passengers with access to a wide range of services, including for safety and on-board user experiences for comfort, well-being, productivity and entertainment. We believe that vehicles will become an integrated device in users’ “connected lives” and consumers will demand the same level of service and convenience from their cars as from their smartphones or tablets. The introduction of mobile 5G will enhance connectivity through better quality network coverage and higher bandwidth. _Autonomous_ Autonomous vehicles will provide drivers with the opportunity to engage in activities not previously possible while driving, such as relaxing, working and socializing. The level of autonomy in a vehicle is assessed from level 0 to level 5, where level 0 signifies no automation in a vehicle and level 5 is fully autonomous. Autonomous technology for level 3 and level 4 currently exists, however, we believe it is unlikely to see rapid deployment due to high cost and an undefined regulatory framework. We believe that robotaxis are likely to be the first mass application of autonomous vehicles with thousands of vehicles already on the road in pilot programs, while private cars are likely to remain focused on ADAS levels 1 and 2 systems for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we expect the automotive industry will need to extend its value-proposition to deliver new user experiences. In this context, we expect vehicle interiors will undergo a significant development and the Cockpit of the Future will be connected, personalized and predictive. The recent acceleration of powertrain electrification is likely to result in a reduction in the level of investment available for autonomous driving, with automakers focusing on the incremental deployment of Level 2 and Level 3 driver assistance systems. 69 ----- _Shared mobility_ Connectivity is also impacting the way users see mobility, as they begin to use new solutions, particularly in urban settings. Ride-sharing services and car-sharing services are experiencing significant growth, driven in particular by city strategies for improved mobility. The introduction of autonomous vehicles as robotaxis (which is an example of the concept of MaaS) should accelerate the shift by significantly reducing costs per kilometer. For MaaS operators to differentiate themselves, the quality of the user experience will be key. As a result, we believe that users of shared mobility will demand personalization of a vehicle’s interior and digital continuity. Mobility operators will need to determine how to offer the best and smoothest customer journey integrating services and multimodal mobility. MaaS operators will therefore become strong vehicle, cockpit and interior specifiers, requesting specific capabilities and functionalities to support their services. In the short-term, ridesharing services have suffered as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, including as a result of lockdowns and economic crisis, as well as increasing health concerns. However, we anticipate that the rise of micromobility alternatives and a demand for electric vehicle car-share schemes in major urban areas is likely to drive a return to shared mobility in the mid-term. _Electrification_ The powertrain mix is rapidly evolving towards electrification, due to environmental concerns and pressure from regulators and society. Whilst different countries are moving towards zero emissions at different speeds, we expect that as technologies mature, we will see a rapid increase in the number of hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles, including both BEV and FCEV. As technologies mature and charging infrastructure is deployed, we believe that there will be a rapid increase in electric vehicles and that BEVs and FCEVs will co-exist as zero emissions alternatives. We believe that fuel cells are particularly adapted to commercial vehicles as they have a longer range and a faster re-fuelling time. This trend towards zero emissions depends on a co-ordinated ecosystem that includes infrastructure and power supply providers. Electrification will accelerate as regulations and government incentives boost both offer and demand and as society becomes increasingly concerned about climate change. We believe that by 2030, 38% of vehicles will be fully electric vehicles, and 32% of vehicles will be hybrid. The significant investments being made in many countries in hydrogen as a clean energy source could be evolutionary for transportation and logistics. _Strategy aligned with automotive megatrends_ As the trends for electrification, connectivity, autonomous driving and ride-sharing accelerate, there are increasing business development opportunities for us in relation to new products, new customers and new business models including the following: New Products - accelerating innovation for powertrain electrification and investing in zero and ultra-low emissions solutions, supported by incentives and regulatory push and responsive to an increase in global demand for mild hybrid and high voltage solutions; - focusing on short time-to-market technology bricks for the Cockpit of the Future adaptable to autonomous driving, reflecting an increasing importance of software and higher willingness of customers to pay for automated driving features; - offering new functionalities through integrated electronics as cars develop into “computers on wheels”, driven in part by safety regulations; and - with the Hella Acquisition, we expect to increase our offering to include life-cycle solutions, including aftermarket, services and repairs and special applications. New Customers - rising Asian OEMs developing vehicles adapted to Asian consumers; - pure electric vehicle consumers; 70 ----- - mobility operators, fleets and cities; and - high horsepower engine manufacturers. New Business Models - increased role of personalized user experiences; - upgradability, retrofit and connected services; and - developing cybersecurity of connected products.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

In 2021, we acquired intellectual property assets of uMist Technologies Ltd., a Swedish start-up specialized in biomimetic spray technology, to accelerate our technology leadership for commercial vehicles ultra-low emissions. We collaborate with local start-up ecosystems, establishing strong connections in major innovation clusters, and to closely follow emerging trends and new technologies. The Group’s platforms are located in Silicon Valley, Toronto, Shenzhen, Paris and Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv platform was inaugurated in 2019 and concentrates on cyber security. In April 2021, Faurecia, Groupe Renault, Knauf Industries, Simoldes, and Coşkunöz, in association with IBM, have signed a partnership contract for the deployment of XCEED (eXtended Compliance End-to-End Distributed), a blockchain based shared solution to trace the compliance of thousands of parts assembled in a vehicle in almost real time. In June 2021, we acquired designLED, the Scotland-based company specialized in advanced backlighting technologies, will strengthen our offer for display technologies and enrich the immersive experiences for the Cockpit of the Future. _Academic partnerships and collaborative innovation_ We work with over 25 academic organizations in open innovation networks, to test, assess and develop prototypes in order to obtain the relevant information to position research for the Group. Important partnerships include those with École Centrale de Nantes for composites, the Collège de France and French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) for polymers and fuel cell technologies, Technische Unversität Dortmund for metals, Supelec-Esigelec for mechatronics and the Indian Institute of Science for sensors. _Collaborative approach to promoting sustainable mobility solutions_ Our CEO is one of the CEOs involved in the governance of Movin’On, an innovative and collaborative think tank aimed at defining mobility trends and setting up pre-competitive studies between the partners. Through its communities of interest Movin’On develops a common vision on specific topics and promotes collaborative intelligence to experiment new mobility solutions. We are also part of the executive group of the Hydrogen Council. The Hydrogen Council is a global initiative of leading energy, transport and industry companies with a united vision and long-term ambition for hydrogen to foster the energy transition. We also play a key role in the World Materials Forum in relation to sustainable mobility. Our CEO is co-chair of the CNH (French National Hydrogen Council) which is aiming at implementing the French hydrogen strategy. We are at the head of the FORCE consortium developing a low cost carbon fiber from natural resources.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

The program aims at capturing a holistic picture of customer satisfaction and feedback, both in term of performance and perception of the overall value chain, from order taking to the start of production. Beyond traditional quality measures, customer feedback is collected immediately and transparently through a dedicated Customer Satisfaction digital application which allows for constant interaction with customers. This application is used by approximately 1,000 customers and we have received feedback on approximately 1,700 occasions giving us an average of 4.2 out of 5 for 2020. Based on this, we systematically implement action plans to improve customer satisfaction through the robustness of our launch performance and operational excellence to support sustained customer loyalty. The program was a key focus for us in 2020 and is an important element in our relationship with our customers as well as an integral part of our culture. 72 ----- Our Total Customer Satisfaction program comprises initiatives such as: the Faurecia Excellence System, the Plant Ranking Initiative and our Digital Manufacturing initiatives. _The Faurecia Excellence System_ The FES is our core operations system governing the organization of our production and operations. It is designed to continuously improve quality, cost, delivery and safety and thereby sustain and improve the operational performance of our production sites around the world through common working methods and language. We believe that this approach is fundamental to enable us to deliver the same level of quality and service throughout the world. The FES complies with applicable quality, environmental and safety standards of the automotive industry (ISO/TS 16949, IATF 16949, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001). In 2019, we redesigned the Faurecia Excellence System to support our joint goals of Total Customer Satisfaction and sustainable operational performance and deployed it across our Group. Renamed “FES X.0”, it provides a clearer, more pragmatic and comprehensive system approach designed to ensure that all employees understand their expected role. The redesigned system was launched through a major global communication and education program consisting of management workshops, multiple new digital learnings and reference documents (FES X.0 Handbook) and a global knowledge-embedding tool for our managers. We believe that FES contributes to the success of our Total Customer Satisfaction program and impacts our financial performance. _Plant Ranking Initiative_ In 2018, we launched a plant ranking initiative which is based on a monthly assessment to promote comparative analysis between production sites. Using a specific tool, plant managers are able to compare their plant’s performance with any other of our plants. The initiative is designed to encourage sharing of best practice, reduce performance gaps and promote competition between sites. In 2019, the plant ranking criteria was updated to provide greater weight to key performance indicators from our Total Customer Satisfaction program. _Digital Manufacturing_ We have introduced digital technology to improve operational efficiency and transform working practices in our production facilities. In 2017, we deployed digital management tools as part of our Digital Enterprise strategy throughout our production processes and supply chain, including real-time information sharing, collaborative robots and autonomous guided vehicles, to optimize assembly automation, quality control and production efficiency. By the end of 2021, over 2,500 smart robots and Automated Guided Vehicles were in use across our plants. More than a hundred of our factories have digital production dashboards, allowing real-time information sharing on the operation of production lines. Digital management tools and the use of “big data” to provide more control over manufacturing processes increases the potential to continue to improve the performance of our industrial assets. We have introduced artificial intelligence solutions for visual inspections of parts in order to improve quality and reduce process variability. We believe that the digitalization of the manufacturing system will strengthen plant performance. _Awards and New Order Intake_ We believe that the numerous awards that we have received from our customers and our record order intake over the last few years demonstrates the confidence of our customers in our Total Customer Satisfaction strategy. We are a strategic partner of many of our major customers, receiving 70 customer recognition awards in 2021 for global performance, manufacturing excellence, cost savings and innovation. In particular, we received a General Motors Supplier of the Year Award, a Ford World Excellence Award and a Cummins Covid19 outstanding supplier award. We also saw an improvement in customer perception with 4.5 stars out of 5 in 2021, compared to 4.2 in 2020. Over the 2019-2021 period, our cumulative order intake was approximately €75.0 billion. In 2021, €2.6 billion of our cumulative order intake was attributable to Faurecia Clarion Electronics, €6.1 billion was attributable to electric vehicles (representing 26% of total order intake) and €6.4 billion was attributable to China (representing 27% of order intake and reflecting the continued strong growth potential of the Chinese market). For the nine months ended 30 September 2022, Forvia achieved an order intake of over €24.5 billion. 73 ----- Notable new business awarded to us in 2021 and in 2022 included: - VW Passat / Skoda Superb complete seat, instrument panel & door panel, over €1.5 billion; - Chinese Chehejia LI X03 complete seat; - BMW Mini & X3/X4 Frames in China; - FAS – BMW NCAR KKL Family – EUR & CN – Frames - FIS – STELLANTIS – FCA DT 1500 – NAO – Instrumental Panel; - FAS – VW – TIGUAN – EUR – Rear Frames; - Daimler E-Class and VW Transporter for complete seats; - instrument panel businesses for the Audi Q5 and door panels for a GM platform covering different Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac vehicles for premium interiors; - clean mobility for VW Audi D-segment platform and PSA C&D segment platforms; - major cockpit assembly awards for Skoda Fabia and Mercedes Vito; - eight contract awards won by Hella to equip different EVs from German premium manufacturers with multifunctional Front Phygital Shields (Lighting); - a contract award with a global long-haul truck leader for the first mass-production of hydrogen storage systems for long-haul trucks; - interiors, cockpit assembly and seating businesses with a leading electric vehicle player in China, North America and Europe; and - award with Daimler for complete seats (first and second rows), expected to generate approximately €2 billion of sales during the course of the award. Among others, we also achieved the following recognition awards over the last few years: - our H2 activities have been selected as an IPCEI pursuant to the European Commission’s criteria by the French Government and will be allocated €213 million (those of Symbio (50/50 joint venture with Michelin) have also been selected); - inclusion of Faurecia in the Euronext CAC 40 ESG® index; - PACE award at the Automotive News magazine’s PACE awards for developing the “Resonance Free Pipe™” (RFP™); - supplier award at the General Motors’ 2019 Supplier of the Year event; - four “Winner” and two “Special Mention” awards at the 2020 German Innovation Award competition; - outstanding program leadership award at the EcoVadis annual 2020 Sustainability Leadership Awards; - supplier award at the 2019 Groupe Renault Supplier event for our operational performance; - two innovation awards at the 2019 Shanghai Automotive Show for our Cockpit of the Future innovations; - “Best Quality Mindset award” at the Groupe Renault Suppliers event for our Pitesti (Romania) plant in 2019; 74 ----- - PACE finalist at the Automotive News magazine’s PACE award for our Perceptual Display Platform Vision; and - IRYStec named 2021 Automotive News magazine’s PACE award winner.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

Over the past several years we have achieved significant improvements in our profitability. Our operating income increased from 3.5% of sales in 2013 to 7.2% of sales in 2019. Although our operating income decreased to (1.8)% of sales in the first half of 2020 as a result of the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting economic crises, our operating income recovered strongly in the second half of 2020 to 6.2% of sales, resulting in our operating income decreasing to 2.9% of sales for the year ended 31 December 2020. For the year ended 31 December 2021, we reported a resilient operating income of €862 million, representing 5.5% of sales despite the semiconductor shortage and increase in raw material prices throughout the year. For the first half of 2022 we reported an operating income of €426 million, representing 3.7% of Forvia’s total sales, reflecting the impacts of inflation, volatility in automotive supply chains related to the war in Ukraine, and the Covid-19 related lockdowns in China during the period. Throughout the first half of 2022, we maintained sufficient liquidity and we ended the period with €4,201.5 million of available cash available as at 30 June 2022 compared to €4,905.7 as at 31 December 2021. We also had €1.95 billion of undrawn commitments, collectively, under the Senior Credit Facility and the Hella Credit Facility as at 30 June 2022, compared to €1.5 billion as of 31 December 2021. We reported net debt of €8,394.4 million as at 30 June 2022 compared to €3,467 million as at 31 December 2021. The ratio of our net debt as at 31 December 2021 to our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2021 fell to 1.6x, showing deleveraging from 1.9x as at 31 December 2020. As at 30 June 2022, net debt to LTM pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 3.1x (see “Summary Financial and Operating Data—Other consolidated financial data” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited LTM Pro Forma Financial Data”). _Structural actions and cost flexibility_ We are also implementing structural changes to make our cost structure more flexible in order to increase our agility and resilience. We aim to rationalize and optimize our industrial footprint and tightly manage our direct and indirect headcount, in addition to other selling, general and administrative cost-cutting measures. These measures have become increasingly important to us in the post Covid-19 environment. We generally seek to pass through increased raw material costs to our customers through a variety of means. Certain raw material cost fluctuations, such as for monoliths, are directly passed through, whilst others are passed through (typically with a time lag) through indexation clauses in our contracts. In addition, we seek to pass through certain other raw material costs to customers through periodic price reviews that are part of our contract management. Our ability to pass through such costs has had a positive impact on our margins and profitability. The impact of inflation in costs has been reduced by offsetting increases in steel and chemical prices through our contractual pass-through to customers. We estimate that our contractual pass-through policies have helped mitigate the impact of inflation in our raw materials costs by an average of over 80% in the first half of 2022 (calculated by comparing the impact of inflation on raw materials costs for the first half of 2022 against our estimation of raw materials inflation exposure for the period) and we believe that ongoing negotiations with customers will continue to mitigate inflationary impacts in 2022. The Group’s operations are not highly energy-intensive: in 2021, Faurecia and Hella, taken together, had energy costs (of which approximately 70% related to electricity and approximately 30% related to gas) that amounted to approximately €170 million, representing only 0.7% of sales. The Group has hedging policies in place that aim to protect our energy costs from the current sharp rise in electricity and gas prices. On top of these hedging policies, we have implemented energy savings measures and accelerated energy self-production through the installation of solar panels at our sites, which are capable of generating approximately 120 gigawatts of additional energy. 75 ----- As a result, we estimate that our total energy costs are expected to grow by only 1.8 times by 2023 compared to energy costs in 2021, whereas we expect energy prices in Europe to increase by more than 10 times in the same period. We seek to achieve steady and predictable levels of capital expenditure and working capital. We are still planning to grow while limiting our capital expenditure and capitalized R&D requirements by seeking better capital expenditure allocation.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

This 12-member body, including 8 independent board members and 2 board members representing employees, meets at least four times a year. Three permanent committees are tasked with the preparation of discussions on specific topics: the Audit Committee, the Governance, Nominations and Sustainability Committee and the Compensation Committee. They make proposals and recommendations and give advice in their respective areas. With their diverse backgrounds, experience and skills, our board members offer us their expertise, support in defining our strategy and tackling the challenges that we face within the context of our transformation and strategic direction. _The Executive Committee_ Our executive functions are performed by an Executive Committee that meets monthly to review our results and oversees our operations and the deployment of our strategy. It discusses and prepares guidelines on important operational subjects, and its decisions are then deployed throughout the Group. _Experienced Management Team_ Our management team has significant experience in the industry. Patrick Koller, our CEO, has been with the Group since 2006. Prior to becoming our CEO, he was Executive Vice President at our Faurecia Seating business group from 2006 to 2015. Michel Favre, Hella’s CEO, has been with the Group since 2013. Prior to becoming Hella’s CEO, he was Faurecia’s Chief Financial Officer, and previously was Executive Vice President (Financial Controlling and Legal) at Rexel SA from 2009 to 2013, Chief Financial Officer at Casino GuichardPerrachon SA from 2006 to 2009 and Chief Financial Officer of Altadis SA from 2001 to 2006. He also held a number of senior financial and operational roles with Valeo SA over a 13-year period including Vice President of the Lighting Branch from 1999 to 2001.

In the six months ended 30 June 2022, our two largest customers accounted for 33.8% of sales compared to approximately 48% of sales in 2008. We 68 ----- also further increased our geographic diversification by increasing the share of our North American and Asian sales. In the six months ended 30 June 2022, sales in Europe, North America and Asia were 46.1%, 25.6% and 24.2% of sales, respectively compared to approximately 74%, 15% and 6% of sales, respectively, in 2008. We benefit from a global customer base. Although Japanese and South Korean automakers tend to use their own network of suppliers, we are today a direct supplier to Nissan and Hyundai. We are present on most market segments, from entry-level models to premium and luxury cars, which make us less vulnerable to the parameters which may affect one particular segment. We also benefit from revenue visibility and stability, due to the inherent difficulties automakers face when changing suppliers in the midst of the development and production of a car model, and from a high renewal rate of our programs. We believe the Hella Acquisition further improves our inroads with automakers and opens new sales opportunities. We believe Hella’s sales may improve by leveraging Faurecia’s privileged access to key Chinese and Japanese OEMs, while we believe Hella’s position with German OEMs will contribute to developing our relationships further with German OEMs, and we believe that Faurecia and Hella will both benefit from complementary strengths with US-based OEMs (see “—Recent _Developments—Combining Faurecia and Hella”)._",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.10,Strategy,15.10.1,Sustainable Mobility,"Our current sustainability strategy rests on a long-term view towards becoming a leader in zero-emissions hydrogen solutions while developing innovative solutions for electric and hybrid vehicles in the near term. To that end, our strategic roadmap for Sustainable Mobility focuses on the following four areas: - developing hydrogen solutions for zero emissions; - developing solutions for ultra-low emission passenger vehicles; - developing solutions for ultra-low emission commercial and industrial vehicles; and - developing sustainable and smart materials. _Sustainable Mobility – Hydrogen solutions for zero emissions: We believe hydrogen mobility will accelerate_ rapidly and achieve significant adoption by 2030. Hydrogen can be produced from various energy sources and is a storable energy carrier that generates no CO2 emissions or polluting gasses when used in vehicles. We believe that hydrogen is very well suited to commercial, heavy-duty on- and off-road vehicles, as well as high-horsepower engines, giving it the potential to transform transportation and logistics. By 2030, it is estimated that three to five million vehicles equipped with fuel cell technology will be on the roads (source: _Hydrogen Council Discussion Paper 2018). Since 2018, we have halved the cost of our fuel cell systems and_ our objective is to continue to reduce the cost significantly. We are developing the next generation of hydrogen systems for commercial and light vehicles, heavy-duty trucks and industrial applications. We currently have the ability to produce several thousands of hydrogen storage systems per year and we aim to significantly increase our production capacity. We aim to become a leader both in hydrogen storage systems and distribution services, which we develop inhouse and for which we have created a centre of excellence in France, and in fuel cell stack systems and services produced by Symbio. We are well-positioned in both of these key elements of fuel cell systems, which we estimate represent 75% of the value chain. We are aiming to expand our production capacity exponentially between now and 2025 to 100,000 tanks per year across three sites: a high-capacity site in Allenjoie, France (serial production to start in 2023 with strong ramp-up in 2024), another site under construction in Lyon, France dedicated to low-volume programs, and a plant in Asia in order to better serve this key market for hydrogen mobility. In line with this ambition, in 2020 we inaugurated our global center of expertise, which aims to develop lightweight and cost-competitive hydrogen storage systems. Located in Bavans, France, the center is dedicated 77 ----- to the design and tests of these systems. Our homologated tanks (350 / 700 bar) will also be produced at this new center. With this global center, we also aim to develop new industrial processes to accelerate production and develop innovative materials and smart tanks to reduce the cost of the systems and increase their safety, durability and recyclability. In 2019, we set up a joint venture with Michelin, incorporating each of its fuel cell related activities, including its subsidiary Symbio, with our fuel cell related activities with the aim of creating a world leader in hydrogen fuel cell systems. Moreover, in 2020, we acquired Ullit for high-pressure tanks. We believe this acquisition with Ullit’s patented technology for impermeable tank shells will help reinforce our unique hydrogen ecosystem. We recently acquired a majority share in CLD, one of China’s largest high-pressure tank manufacturers. We are working with CLD to develop and manufacture type III and IV hydrogen storage tanks for the Chinese market. Sustainable Mobility – Solutions for ultra-low emission passenger vehicles:_ The requirement for increasing content in the powertrain to meet emissions control regulations, as well as the need for significant reduction in CO2 emissions, drive the need for several of our key technologies which we estimate will increase the overall value of the exhaust line by 20% by 2030. We supply post-treatment systems for internal combustion and hybrid powered engines in order to reduce emissions and noise levels and recover lost energy. The key technologies for fuel economy and emissions reduction that are already in production or will be by 2025 are the EHC solutions including a pre-heating function that can give a near zero emissions vehicle, and a combined EGR / EHRS which can give over 3% CO2 savings. Electrification also drives demand for ultra-quiet vehicles and we have developed products to reduce engine noise through advanced exhaust line architecture, electric valves and resonance free pipes. _Sustainable Mobility – Solutions for ultra-low emission commercial and industrial vehicles: We are anticipating_ the ongoing emissionization of all commercial vehicles, particularly in growth markets like China and India, where regulations are converging towards European and North American standards. Technologies such as our heated doser contributes to ultra-low NOx emissions by operating efficiently even at lower temperatures and is compatible with current and future after treatment architectures. In 2018, we acquired Hug Engineering, the European leader in complete exhaust gas purification systems for high horsepower engines. In 2020, stringent regulations were implemented in all regions both for stationary and marine applications.

As occupant positions may no longer need to be fixed facing forward and upright, users will have more freedom to do other tasks during their journey. To 78 ----- ensure that passengers are safe in all seated positions, features such as airbags or the seatbelt can be integrated directly into the seat. This technology called the AVS allows occupants to drive, relax and work safely and efficiently. Smart kinematics effortlessly recline, lift, adjust and swivel the seat, and then return it smoothly and quickly back to the upright or driving position. Through our partnership with ZF, we are developing safety systems so that passengers can continue to travel safely in any seated position, whether they are driving, working or relaxing. We are also developing solutions that provide an optimal onboard experience and enhance wellness. Through close monitoring of the thermal and postural comfort of the occupants, the cockpit will learn each occupant’s preferences over time and leverage artificial intelligence to make adjustments so that people feel better at the end of their journey. In terms of personalized sound experiences, we are combining activated sound surfaces, smart headrests integrating local ANC, IP and telephony, and high-end premium sound, such as that provided through our partnership with Devialet. _Connected services: We are focused on developing “smart surfaces” for drivers’ expecting greater intuitive_ interaction with their vehicles. “Smart surfaces” combine traditional vehicle interior surfaces, such as the dashboard, with digital displays that are able to control cockpit temperature, sound and lighting. Increased connectivity in vehicles will drive new business models for upgradability, retrofit and services across the vehicle lifetime. We have developed a number of partnerships for connected services: with Microsoft for cloud connectivity, with Accenture for digital services and with Aptoide for an automotive app store.

Through this program, we aim to both reduce our environmental impact and create long-term value across our entire supply chain. We are investing in innovation to advance the sustainability of our products and industrial processes across all of our businesses. We have developed a plan in three stages to achieve this goal. Our action plan has been reviewed and validated by SBTi. Our plan was developed prior to the Hella Acquisition and is expected to be reviewed or revised ahead of our annual report for the year ended 31 December 2022, and released in 2023, to account for the closing of the Hella Acquisition and any impact it may have. 80 ----- - _By 2025: Internal Emissions: we aim to be CO2 neutral for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions across all of our sites. This will be achieved through using less energy and renewable energy either purchased or produced on sites. To reach our goals, we partner with experts and invest in energy-efficiency projects at our production facilities. - _By 2030:_ _Controlled Emissions: we aim to be CO2 neutral for our Controlled Emissions. Controlled Emissions include emissions from upstream and downstream activities: purchases, lease, freight, travel, waste and recycling. This will be achieved through strong collaboration with our suppliers and the reorganization of our purchasing processes for low-carbon raw materials, in particular steel and plastics, product redesign and services such as transportation. - _By 2050: Total Emissions: we aim to be CO2 neutral for our total emissions as the whole industry moves towards zero-emissions mobility and a circular economy. We have also entered into a partnership with Schneider Electric, Engie and KPMG to develop an action plan to optimize energy sourcing and to use less energy and clean energy across our sites. This will involve on-site renewable energy production and external renewable energy sourcing. With the help of Engie and Schneider Electric, Faurecia undertook energy audits of around 140 sites at the end of 2021, with a view to identifying energy cost saving investments. The goal is to achieve fully decarbonized energy by 2025. In July 2021, we selected KPMG as our partner for on-site power purchase agreements advisory services. Under this partnership, we will benefit from KPMG’s expertise to prepare, execute and implement our solar panel equipment program across all facilities, worldwide, which is a step on our CO2 neutrality journey. We will delegate the installation and the operation of these renewable electricity production assets to developers, and KPMG will advise and support us to identify and contract the right developers. In September 2021, we also selected a Swedish steel maker SSAB, to partner for fossil-free high strength steel for use in our Seating business. This partnership makes us the first automotive supplier to explore fossil-free steel with SSAB and marks a major milestone on our CO2 neutrality journey. We aim to start equipping our seating structures with SSAB fossil-free steel from 2026 onwards. SSAB will provide us with the industry’s most ambitious and advanced fossil-free steel, using hydrogen and zero-carbon electricity instead of coking coal and other fossil fuels traditionally used to make steel. Under this partnership, we will develop, test, validate and industrialize ultra-low CO2 seat structures. While the long-term impact of the Covid-19 global pandemic on the automotive industry is still unclear, we believe that some trends are being accelerated, in particular powertrain electrification. We currently estimate that by 2030 approximately 30% of the market will be full electric vehicles and 37% of the market will be hybrid vehicles. We believe that our strategy is aligned with the needs of the automotive industry as we invest in fuel cell technology and our CO2 neutral initiative. In 2022, we commissioned a study to assess our industrial portfolio, including Hella’s portfolio, against multiple climate physical risks under different scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Our ambition is to deleverage to the extent that our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio reaches less than 1.5x by 2025. With respect to selective sales growth, our ambition is to reach approximately €30 billion in annual sales in 2025. To meet our target, for the period through 2025 we aim to: - adjust product mix to higher electronics content and reduced ICE exposure; - continue increases in the share of Electrified, Premium and SUVs in our product mix; and - continue growth in Asia, in particular China, which has outperformed the overall worldwide production level in recent years. We intend to allocate 60% of net cash flow to deleveraging our balance sheet, and the remaining 40% of net cash flow to dividends and share repurchases (mainly allocated to performance share plans, to avoid dilution for shareholders). With respect to reducing costs, our ambition is to reach an operating margin of more than 7% in 2025. To meet our target, for the period through 2025 we aim to: - rationalize and optimize our industrial footprint across business groups; - reach operational efficiency by reducing our manufacturing and operational costs (by more than 200 basis points between 2022 and 2025); - reduce gross R&D costs by 100 basis points between 2022 and 2025 and selling, general and administrative expenses by 60 basis points between 2022 and 2025; - control fixed costs while continuing to invest in electronics and sustainability; and - realize cost synergies and optimisations from the integration of Hella. With respect to cash management, our ambition is to reach net cash flow margin of 4% of sales by 2025. To meet our target, for the period through 2025 we aim to: - improve net cash flow generation; - maximise R&D efficiency by focusing on high return platforms; - reduce our working capital requirements (by at least 150 basis points in 2025 compared to 2022, including synergies with Hella) and capital expenditures (by 100 basis points in 2025 compared to 2022, including synergies with Hella); and - continue active management of financings to ensure optimized cost in the medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

Worldwide automotive production in 2021 amounted to 73.4 million light vehicles, an increase of only 3.8% year-on-year. The difficult situation in the second half of 2021, with a low point in the third quarter (only 15.8 million light vehicles were produced in the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 19% vs. the third quarter of 2020), strongly disrupted our customers’ activity during that period, which resulted in unprecedented high volatility in OEM programs and numerous and erratic production stops & gos for Faurecia. The volatility in OEM programs, which reached its peak in September and October 2021. The shortage of semiconductors has continued in the first half of 2022. Production of automobiles in Europe decreased a further 17.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 and 11.8% in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021. Supply chain disruptions in Europe were also impacted by the war in Ukraine. In China, supply chain disruptions were further impacted by Covid-related restrictions implemented in April and May in the Shanghai and Changchun areas, with automotive production up only 1.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, worldwide automotive production in the first half of 2022 decreased by 0.6% compared to the first half of 2021, to 37.2 million light vehicles (down 6 million light vehicles or 14% compared to the 43.3 million light vehicles produced in the first half of 2019, prior to the Covid pandemic and supply chain disruptions).",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

The divestment of HBPO represents close to 30% of the total target for the divestment plan. We expect to announce at least one further divestment by the end of 2022, and announce the remaining divestments under the program by mid-2023 in order to close such transactions by the end of 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.13,Recent Developments,15.13.5,Combining Faurecia and Hella,"Our business combination with Hella marks a step in our ambition to accelerate our strategic transformation, investing in fast-growing segments with leading positions. The Hella Acquisition is a strategic opportunity for us, enabling us to create the world’s seventh largest supplier to the automotive industry, with a cutting-edge technology portfolio that addresses the major trends in the industry, and to achieve the combination of two highly complementary companies focused on innovation, operational excellence, customer satisfaction and ESG. We completed the Hella Acquisition on the Completion Date with the settlement of transactions representing an investment by us of €5.4 billion and a total enterprise value of €6.7 billion for 100% of Hella. On the Completion Date, we purchased 88,329,028 shares representing 79.5% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella, including the purchase of 66,666,669 shares representing 60% of the share capital and voting rights of 86 ----- Hella from the Family Pool and the settlement of the Public Tender Offer for 21,662,359 shares tendered, representing 19.5% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella. We also, as of 31 March 2022, purchased 2,327,078 shares of Hella (which includes 77,580 shares of Hella acquired from the Family Pool) in openmarket or off-market transactions, representing 2.09% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella. As a result of the above, we held 81.59% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella as of 31 March 2022. With our 81.59% interest in Hella, we are now the controlling shareholder of Hella, given the legal status of Hella as a GmbH &Co. KGaA, which has allowed us to begin, from the Completion Date, to implement our strategy for integrating Hella to benefit from cost synergies and optimized operations. Hella will continue to be a listed company with its own governance, and has been fully consolidated into Faurecia’s financial accounts since 1 February 2022. As part of the Hella Acquisition, and following discussions with Hella and the members of the Family Pool, we had agreed in August 2021 to the following: - the BCA, under the terms of which we undertook, among other things, to launch the Public Tender Offer for all of Hella’s shares at a price of €60.00 per share, amounting to total consideration of €60.96 per share (which includes a dividend of €0.96 according to a resolution by the Hella shareholders at their annual general meeting on 30 September 2021 and paid by Hella to all its shareholders prior to the Completion Date), which corresponds to a premium of 33% compared to the latest unaffected share price of €45.8 as of 26 April 2021 and of 24% compared to the unaffected 3-month volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of €49.10 prior to 27 April 2021; and - the Hella Acquisition Agreement, and the Investment Agreement (as amended on 21 January 2022), under the terms of which we undertook to purchase the entire stake held by the Family Pool in the Block Trade of 66,666,669 shares of Hella, representing 60% of the share capital and voting rights of Hella, at a price of €60.00 per share, paid through a combination of: (i) €3.4 billion in cash (i.e., 57,153,018 shares in Hella at €60.00 per share), (ii) 13,571,385 of our ordinary shares (such shares were issued in accordance with the existing capital increase authorizations granted by our shareholders at their meeting on 31 May 2021; the exchange ratio was determined based on a one-day VWAP trading price of €38.635 per share on the last trading day of Faurecia shares on Euronext Paris immediately before the Completion Date, at which price such shares were valued at €524.3 million) and (iii) €46.2 million (i.e., the remainder of the 770,676 shares in Hella held by the Family Pool at €60.00 per share). As a result, the Family Pool became our largest shareholder with approximately 9% of our share capital, subject to an 18-month lock-up agreement. Dr. Jürgen Behrend was appointed as a Family Pool representative to the Faurecia Board of Directors and his appointment was confirmed at our Combined General Meeting of 1 June 2022, emphasizing the Family Pool’s strong commitment to the Group’s strategy and outlook. Pursuant to the Public Tender Offer, Hella’s shareholders were permitted under the German Takeover Act (Übernahmeangebot) to tender their shares in Hella starting on 27 September 2021 until 11 November 2021 (the “Public Tender Offer Expiration Date”). We published the final results on https://www.faureciaoffer.com following the Public Tender Offer Expiration Date, and we settled the Public Tender Offer on the Completion Date for cash consideration of €1.3 billion. The Hella Acquisition was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors at a meeting held on 9 August 2021, and received the support of Hella’s management. The Group focuses on four growth areas, fully aligned with automotive key trends: - Electric Mobility (including hydrogen solutions), - ADAS & Autonomous Driving, - Cockpit of the Future, and - Life-Cycle Solutions. We believe that with approximately 2,650 software and data engineers the Group is positioned to become a major technological player in the automotive electronics and software fields. 87 ----- We view the strategic rationale for the Hella Acquisition as follows: (1) _Combining Faurecia with Hella’s strong identity, businesses and employees. We value the technology and innovations of Hella and we intend to further enhance and globalize their activities. The Hella Acquisition is an opportunity for our companies to accelerate our technological transformation, achieve critical size and leading positions in Electronics (aiming for more than €6.3 billion of sales by 2025) and Life-Cycle Solutions. Hella has established three business groups (Electronics, Lighting and Lifecyle Solutions), headquartered in Lippstadt, Germany. Our objective is to leverage Hella’s talents to achieve profitable growth for the Group. We believe that stability in Hella’s management and their continued involvement is a key factor in integrating successfully into one Group. (2) _Establishing ourselves as the seventh largest global automotive technology supplier focused on fast- _growing automotive technologies, with leading positions and with a significantly increased ‘powertrain-agnostic’ share of revenues by:_ - _Developing a strong and focused offer for Electric Mobility (BEV and FCEV). The Group aims to develop a comprehensive offer for electric vehicles (HEVs, PHEVs, BEVs and FCEVs), building on Hella’s energy management portfolio, sensors and actuators related to BEVs, as well as our hydrogen system solutions (FCEV) and hybrid systems. The Group’s product offering, may include, for instance, Hella’s battery management systems, DC/DC converters, onboard charging systems combined with our battery pack systems, hydrogen storage systems and stack systems. With such a portfolio of solutions, the Group plans to be uniquely positioned to benefit from the zero emissions mobility market transition, in particular with a view to decreasing ICE sales exposure from less than 20% at the Completion Date and down to approximately 10% in 2025. - _Becoming a major player in Electronics and Software solutions to accelerate in ADAS & _Autonomous Driving. In ADAS & Autonomous Driving systems, we aim to create a strong_ global player supporting the next high-speed and low-speed ADAS convergence with the combination of Faurecia Clarion Electronics with Hella Electronics and Software. The Group’s products on offer may include, for instance, radars, electric power steering (including fail operational systems features, meaning the device can operate even in case of failure), e-mirrors, 360° views and automated parking solutions. The Group operates 24 production sites and 21 R&D centers in the new electronics business group combining Faurecia Clarion Electronics with Hella Electronics and Software. The ambition of the Group, with orders already significantly booked, is to grow sales to more than €6.3 billion in 2025. - _Boosting Faurecia’s Cockpit of the Future strategy thanks to complementary portfolios. Our leading positions in Seating and Interiors (including SAS) combined with Hella’s leading position in Interior Lighting and both companies’ Electronics should significantly strengthen our Cockpit of the Future strategy. Hella’s interior HMI (Human Machine Interface) solution capabilities, its portfolio of body electronics (access, comfort, seat), sensors and actuators will support value creation through new customer experiences. - _Creating a Life-Cycle Solutions activity, in line with environmental concerns and industry _evolutions. The Hella Acquisition will bring opportunities to build a real life-cycle solutions_ offer, including Aftermarket, Services & Repairs and Special Applications. We believe it will be able to enhance well-established Hella brands. It will allow to leverage potential business in eco-design products, sustainable materials and circular economy. (3) _Accelerating innovation with strong R&D capabilities. We expect to expand innovation and R&D projects through a combined total of approximately 300 industrial sites, approximately 75 R&D centers and approximately 150,000 people, including more than 35,000 engineers and specialists, across more than 40 countries. With six business groups with 24 product lines and a strong IP portfolio of over 14,400 patents, we aim to be the preferred innovation and integration partner for OEMs worldwide. (4) _Capitalizing on complementary customer portfolios across all geographies and leveraging Faurecia’s _strong position in Asia, particularly in China. The Hella Acquisition has brought together two_ 88 ----- companies with established and complementary positions. It will open new sales opportunities for Hella by leveraging our privileged access to key Chinese and Japanese OEMs. We believe Hella’s position with German OEMs will contribute to improving our inroads with German OEMs. We believe that we and Hella will both benefit from complimentary strength with US-based OEMs. (5) _Generating significant synergies to drive profitability and cash generation improvement. We_ estimate that cost synergies and optimization, including procurement, SG&A expenses and other operating expenses, should generate more than €250 million adjusted EBITDA estimated run-rate cost savings, with an 80% income statement impact to be achieved in 2024, although we also anticipate integration and implementation costs of approximately €250 million. Management believes that the profit and loss impact should gradually ramp up from 2023 through 2025 and for sales synergies to generate between €300 million and €400 million of estimated sales starting in approximately 2025, capitalizing on our strong footprint in China, Japan and the Americas to sell the Hella brand and on Hella’s position with German OEMs to enhance our market share. In addition to these synergies, estimated cash flow optimization by approximately €200 million per year on average from 2022 to 2025 will be generated mainly through working capital and capital expenditures. (6) _Leveraging common ESG commitments and priorities. Both companies share strong values, including ESG approaches involving ambitious CO2 neutrality roadmaps. The Group is a driving force in the decarbonation and sustainability of mobility. We secured the financing for the cash portion of the Hella Acquisition Price through up to €5.5 billion in Bridge Facilities under the Bridge Facility Agreement signed with a syndicate of international banks. We drew down €2.9 billion from the Bridge Facilities to finance the cash portion of the Hella Acquisition Price. Approximately €2.2 billion remained outstanding under the Bridge Facilities as at 30 June 2022, of which €500 million corresponded to the three-year Term Loan A Bridge Facility and €1.7 billion corresponded to the Term Loan B Bridge Facility and Term Loan C Bridge Facility, collectively, following the partial repayment of the Term Loan C Bridge Facility in June 2022 using the proceeds of a €705 million capital increase in June 2022. Approximately €1.7 billion remains outstanding under the Bridge Facilities as at the date of this Offering Circular following partial repayments of the Bridge Facilities using (i) the proceeds of the EIB Loan, supplemented by cash from our balance sheet, and (ii) the proceeds of the Latin American Syndicated Loan. As of 30 June 2022, on an adjusted basis after giving effect to this Offering, the borrowings under the Latin American Syndicated Loan and the EIB Loan and the use of the proceeds therefrom and cash on balance sheet to partially repay the Bridge Facilities, we had ample liquidity of €6.2 billion, including €4.2 billion of available cash and €2.0 billion collectively from the Secured Credit Facility and the Hella Credit Facility, each fully undrawn.

From 2021, phased in from 2020, the EU fleet-wide average emission target for new cars will be 95g CO2/km, in contrast with the goal of 180g CO2/km which was in force ten years ago. The next requirement will be a reduction from the 2021 baseline of 15% for both cars and vans to around 80g CO2/km from 2025 onwards and then 37.5% for cars and 31% for vans from 2030 onwards. In China, the government has set a target of 95g CO2/km for passenger vehicles by 2025, followed by 75g CO2/km. These objectives will require breakthroughs in design and materials. We are already active in the various areas that help reduce vehicle weight by offering new products and new designs applicable to existing products, optimized design, and are working to develop alternative materials and new manufacturing processes. As a world leader in clean technologies, we are committed to offering innovative solutions in zero and ultra-low emission mobility and the reduction of emissions from all types of vehicles.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.27,Our Industry,15.27.2,Environmental performance,"Emissions of all combustion-related pollutants are subject to standards that are converging towards a drastic reduction. Reducing fuel consumption results in increased levels of pressure and higher temperatures in combustion chambers, which are damaging to the environment in terms of emissions of gas, pollutants and particulates. Direct fuel injection, increasingly widespread in gasoline engines, generates particulates that may require treatment in the exhaust system. We have been supplying particulate filters for gasoline engines since 2014, when we were the first company to introduce them as standard equipment in the market. The new Euro 6c emission standards have made it mandatory for all vehicles produced after 1 September 2018 with gasoline engines to have particulate filters installed, as has been the case for diesel engines since 2011. We are able to develop exhaust systems integrating the most efficient pollutant and particulate treatment technologies as a result of our experience in all aspects of the design and production of exhaust systems. In 2018, we offered an innovative solution to an important General Motors program to save fuel and reduce CO2 emissions. Called “Resonance Free Pipe™” (RFP™), this innovation reduces the weight and the architectural complexity of exhaust by eliminating resonance. In 2019, we received Automotive News magazine’s 2019 PACE award for this innovation. In 2018, we further strengthened our technological offerings for clean mobility with our acquisition of Hug Engineering, a leader in whole systems for exhaust gas purification of extremely high-powered engines. In 2020, stringent regulations were implemented in all regions both for stationary and marine applications. In order to adapt to stricter emission regulations and to improve air quality, we developed “Electric Heated Catalyst” technology that will enable the emission control system in vehicles to reach its maximum efficiency at a faster pace. As stringent emissions regulations continue to come into force around the world, and as the demand for electrified vehicles continues to grow, we have made hydrogen mobility a strategic priority. We are at the heart of a growing ecosystem of partners supporting the industrialization and adoption of hydrogen mobility at scale. We have a clear roadmap to develop hydrogen solutions for vehicles ranging from passenger cars to commercial vehicles, and aim to support different use cases, logistical constraints and industries over the coming decade. 94 ----- We also cover 75% of the hydrogen powertrain with hydrogen storage systems, as well as fuel cell stack systems through Symbio, our joint venture with Michelin. We are striving to become a world leader in hydrogen mobility and targeting €3.5 billion in sales by 2030. In addition, we aim to work alongside leading OEMs to provide hydrogen mobility solutions to a variety of industries. Production of these hydrogen mobility solutions began in 2021 and are planned to continue for Hyundai (X-Cient), Stellantis (vans Peugeot e-Expert, Citroen Jumpy, Opel e-vivaro), Hyvia (Renault), Gaussin and SAIC.

127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.27,Our Industry,15.27.3,Sustainable development and use of raw materials,"Materials are increasingly chosen and designed to satisfy regulatory constraints and societal expectations. Depending on the engine type and driving cycle, decreasing the average vehicle’s total mass by 100kg reduces CO2 emissions by approximately 8-10g per kilometer driven. Our products can represent up to 20% of a vehicles’ total weight. This makes us a major contributor to the reduction of vehicle weight as a means of cutting fuel consumption, limiting emissions of greenhouse gases and reducing the use of raw materials in vehicle production. From 2015, the European Commission imposed stricter requirements where the recyclability of synthetic materials such as plastics and, in the longer term, composite materials is one of the key features of the vehicle of the future. We offer bio-sourced natural fibers, including hemp and vegetable fibers, which make it possible to attain high performance in reducing environmental impact: the proportion of natural fibers in plastics is renewable and the sustainability of plastics as well as the lesser weight of products allow for responsible consumption and use of these materials. The environmental impact of this innovation was assessed according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 international standards. Natural hemp fibers used by us also reduce environmental impact as the natural fibers in plastics is renewable and the lesser weight of products allows for responsible consumption and use of these materials. Plastic materials strengthened with hemp are recognized as compatible with industrial recycling processes already in place. We are currently developing the NFPP family, a new range of interiors components for compression technology. These materials enable up to 50% weight reduction and are expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% as well. We believe this new product line will assist in accelerating development of bio-sourced and recyclable materials providing significant weight, energy and CO2 emission reduction. We are already making a contribution having patented three technologies utilizing biomaterials. Lignolight technology, using compressed fibers for between 50% and 90% of the resin, applied to door panels, improves density by 40% compared with traditional components. NAFILean™ technology (Natural Fiber Injection), which combines natural hemp fibers with polypropylene resin, reduces weight by 25% compared with talcloaded polypropylene. To date, more than 17 vehicles are equipped with NAFILean™ technology. NAFILite™, a project we developed together with a major French agricultural cooperative, Interval, which combines NAFILean™ material and an injection (foaming process) can further reduce weight by 10%. NAFILite™ received a sustainability award at the JEC World 2017 Innovation Awards. In order to grow and manufacture lighter and cleaner vehicles, we take environmental factors into account at all stages of the product life cycle, from product design to the environmental impact of our plants, from supplier collaboration to product end-of-life. We have gradually put in place a management system that allows us to be particularly responsive to new restrictions and to set up an alternative project if necessary. Our management system includes an investigation phase to collect reports from our suppliers, notably in the context of the new EU regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation, and setting up an alternative project if necessary).",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

Focusing on innovation, project- engineering and production, we play a leading role in shaping the automotive industry around the world. Around two thirds of our plants producing components are specifically located near our customers’ plants in order to streamline industrial and supply chain costs. Around a third of our sites use a just-in-time business model, meaning that rather than stock-piling raw materials and finished products, components are produced based on the specifications communicated by the customer on the day of production. Located near automakers’ assembly lines or even set up within their actual industrial parks, these sites are capable of delivering to our customers’ production lines in less than three hours. For this reason, much of our property, plant and equipment is specifically dedicated to particular client programs and utilization rates are dependent on the activity level of the customers. Most of our property, plants and equipment is comprised of machinery, specific tooling and new plants in the process of construction, as well as land and buildings involved in our production processes. The level of automation in our manufacturing plants will depend on the local context and customers’ needs; however, none of our plants are 100% automated and the skills of our employees is a key factor of our quality level. By the end of 2021, over 1,150 smart robots (including collaborative robots, visual guided robots) and over 1,350 automated guided vehicles had been installed at Faurecia production sites.

Market conditions weakened significantly in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with lingering uncertainty in 2021 and 2022, and market conditions continue to suffer from a shortage of semiconductors. The shortage of semiconductors in 2021 was exacerbated by winter storms in Texas in February and a fire disaster at a plant of a major supplier in Japan in March 2021. In addition, worldwide automotive production experienced a reduction in the first quarter of 2022 of 4.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2021 according to S&P Global Mobility, due partially to the impact of the ongoing semiconductor shortage. On 19 April 2022, S&P Global Mobility released its forecast for worldwide automotive production, which was expected to be 77.3 million light vehicles (rather than the estimate of 80.7 million light vehicles forecasted in February 2022 prior to the start of the war in Ukraine) as compared to 73.4 million light vehicles produced in 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

In 2018, we initiated our Total Customer Satisfaction program. This program aims at getting a global picture of our customer satisfaction both in term of performance and perception of the overall value chain: from order taking to production start. Beyond those quality measures, customer feedback is now collected instantly and in a transparent way through a dedicated digital application. The Faurecia Excellence System (“FES”) is defining how production and operations are being organized. It has been built to improve quality, cost, delivery and security on a continuous basis, based on a common framework for all plants around the world, guaranteeing the best possible operational performance. The FES, renamed “FES X.0”, was updated in 2018 to make it more pragmatic and accessible to employees as well as to accelerate digitization. FES X.0 is being deployed during 2019 and will be an important contributor to our Total Customer Satisfaction program and our financial performance. We have developed a Quick Response Continuous Improvement (“QRCI”) approach to analyze the frequency of work-related accidents to measure the effectiveness of actions carried out in the relevant area. After each accident, a QRCI analysis is performed using a problem-solving method based on best practices in terms of solving quality problems to ensure that the primary causes of the accident are understood, that corrective actions have been effective and that preventative measures are implemented and shared across the various sites. Our major customers acknowledge that we offer one of the highest levels of quality worldwide, as evidenced by numerous awards received from customers each year. Detailed monitoring of specific performance with each customer has been introduced in order to ensure that corrective measures are taken immediately to address any quality issues at a given plant.

Moreover, the Group has reached agreements, for non-material amounts, with the plaintiffs to settle all three class actions which were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against several suppliers of emissions control systems, including group affiliates, alleging anticompetitive practices in regard to Exhaust Systems. These agreements have been validated by the court. All investigations by competition authorities are now closed. Two class actions for similar allegations have also been filed in Canada. These class actions have been subject to agreements for non-material amounts. These agreements have been validated by the court on December 2020 and are no longer subject to appeal.

On 14 September 2022, Faurecia concluded such a coordination agreement (the “Coordination Agreement”) with Hella. The Coordination Agreement does not provide for any payment to be made by one party to any other party. Nevertheless, should some of the measures with respect to the envisaged cooperation between 107 ----- Faurecia and Hella result in costs or other disadvantages at the level of Hella, such disadvantages would be included in Hella’s dependency report (as required under German law) and be compensated by Faurecia. The Coordination Agreement has an initial fixed term of five (5) years and shall be automatically renewed for further consecutive fixed terms of two (2) years each, unless otherwise terminated by either party no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the respective term. The Coordination Agreement shall automatically terminate six (6) months from the date on which Faurecia ceases to own, directly or indirectly, at least forty (40) per cent of the shares in Hella. Entering into the Coordination Agreement has formed a step in the envisaged integration of Faurecia and Hella, be instrumental in realizing potential synergies within the Group and help creating legal security for both parties. The conclusion of the Coordination Agreement was approved by Faurecia’s Board of Directors during its meeting on 18 February 2022. Given the Faurecia's controlling stake in Hella’s share capital, the corporate form of Hella and the governance in place, the implementation of the identified synergies and the optimization plan began as soon as the acquisition was completed on 31 January 2022.

The Senior Credit Facility was renegotiated on 15 June 2018, in order to extend the maturity to five years from that date, i.e. 15 June 2023 (with the possibility to extend such maturity by two one-year periods), and improve its terms and conditions. In June 2019, the maturity was extended to 15 June 2024 with agreement from all lenders.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Notes-There currently exists no market for the Notes, and we cannot provide _assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes”._ The Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. We have applied, through our listing agent in Ireland, to have the Notes listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to admit the Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market. Neither the Initial Purchasers nor we can assume that the Notes will be approved for admission to listing and trading, and will remain listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, commercial lending, consulting and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which we may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and expense reimbursement. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are lenders under our Senior Credit Facility and the Bridge Facilities. In addition certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have entered into factoring arrangements with us for which they may receive customary fees. A share of the overall transaction proceeds will be used to partially repay the Bridge Facilities, under which Société Générale and Natixis are arrangers and lenders and certain of the Initial Purchasers, including Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and BNP Paribas, are lenders. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may enter into derivative and/or structured transactions with their customers in connection with the Notes and the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also purchase some of the Notes to hedge their risk exposure in connection with such transactions. Also, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may acquire for their own account the Notes offered hereby. Such acquisitions may have an effect on the demand and the price of the Notes. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that we will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on the applicable Issue Date, which will be the      business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+     “). Trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Circular will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. 161 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,214

In addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France or it has an establishment in France or, (ii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office or its main center of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Code de commerce, is deemed to be in France, it could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., either safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde and sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement _judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation _judiciaire)._ Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our Group having its COMI in France could be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation also lists accelerated financial safeguard proceedings as insolvency proceedings but accelerated financial safeguard proceedings no longer have a separate existence under French law as they have been merged into accelerated safeguard proceedings as of 1 October 2021 (save for proceedings commenced before this date) by the 2021 Ordinance. Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or court-administered proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) €20 million in net turnover and 250 employees or (y) €40 million in net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts. In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds). Accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes. _Grace Periods_ In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 13435 of the French Code civil. Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations that are due and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Code civil will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see section “Court-Assisted Proceedings” below). 169 ----- _Insolvency Test_ Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria. The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see section “Hardening Period” below). _Court-Assisted Proceedings_ A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. _Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure_ of the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the _mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually also accept to abstain from such action while they are ongoing. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French _Code civil (see section “Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court_ but is not formally approved by it. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties_ of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. 170 ----- Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Code de commerce, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Code civil (see section “Grace periods” above) if a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, is suing for payment, or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim (suspendre l’exigibilité de sa créance). In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor - following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened – if: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the terms of the conciliation agreement ensure the continuation of the business as a going-concern; and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgment (constatation) as described above and, in addition: (i) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the amount of any Conciliation Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court; (ii) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including with respect to certain precommencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “Conciliation",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,2145,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEABILITY CONSIDERATIONS,2145.1,Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on 5 June 2015 and,2145.1.2,,"applies to insolvencies which commenced after 26 June 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have considered a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts most of its business or has its head office and the location where most of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined to decide which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary 165 ----- (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”. When main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. When main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: (i) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; (ii) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; (iii) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and (iv) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the 166 ----- relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a debtor and its creditors, the court, at the request of the debtor or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. When the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: (i) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii) insolvency practitioners and courts; (ii) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; (iii) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and (iv) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on 31 January 2020 at 11.00 p.m. (i.e., exit day) and therefore is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the _European Union (Withdrawal _Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect_ in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly applicable EU law (which includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into UK domestic law. However, while direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The _Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) _Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) set out a number of amendments to be made to the Insolvency Regulation, as_ it will apply in the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period. On 30 December 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement provisionally applies as from 1 January 2021. There remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and the extent to which “Brexit” could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone or the EU. Further, the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in 167 ----- cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state. _EU Directive on Preventive Restructuring Frameworks_ The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU **Restructuring Directive”) was published on 26 June 2019. The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of a restructuring. In order to transpose the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, the French government issued: (i) on 15 September 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as from 1 October 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and (ii) on 23 September 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the implementation of the 2021 Ordinance. The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law, as amended by the 2021 Ordinance and the 2021 Decree, for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
127_3,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,2145,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEABILITY CONSIDERATIONS,2145.2,"Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or",2145.2.1,,"judicial liquidation proceedings; (iii) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted), not even through a cram-down or a crossclass cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed); (iv) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and (v) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of occurrence of the insolvency (see section “Insolvency test” above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (see section “Hardening Period” below), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force: 171 ----- (i) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; (ii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Code de commerce, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and (iii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Code de commerce, a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor during the execution of the conciliation agreement pursuant to Article L. 611-101 of the French Code de commerce mentioned above. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the conciliation agreement addressing the consequences of such termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may also be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by potential recoveries made) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (i.e., prepack disposal plan) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements, offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may, after consultation of the public prosecutor, be considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or_ (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. Although French accelerated safeguard proceedings are the transposition into French law of preventive restructuring proceedings in the spirit of the EU Restructuring Directive, they are defined in the French Code _de commerce by reference to standard safeguard proceedings._ As a result and for the sake of clarity, standard safeguard proceedings will be presented below before accelerated safeguard proceedings. 172 ----- _Court-Administered Proceedings - Safeguard_ A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors (or submit to the classes of affected parties – see below) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de _surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all_ under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Code de commerce, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (i)(b) above where: (i) the court may not act upon its own initiative, and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller (“Contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. _Judicial Restructuring Lien: Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard or judicial_ reorganization or liquidation proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial Restructuring Lien”): (i) during the observation period, in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the temporary continuation of business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the supervisory judge and are subject to publicity, or (ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must be specifically 173 ----- mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan, enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien (iv) pre-commencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Code du travail. The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to commencement of the proceedings. In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. Creditors (and if applicable, equity holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for commencement of_ the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Code de commerce) have less than (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debtfor-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the shareholders’ special meetings or the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. 174 ----- Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that_ were submitted to them (subject to exceptions such as the ones applicable to claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates falling after the term of the plan, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if such date is later than the first payment date provided for in the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps. _Class-based consultation: This applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the_ proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Code de commerce), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties _affectées), as defined below._ Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan. Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Code de commerce, affected parties are: (i) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan; (ii) equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are modified by the proposed plan. The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes representing a sufficient commonality of economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions: (i) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of their claim so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes; (ii) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class; (iii) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and 175 ----- (iv) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme (AGS) claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account. The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered certified accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust. Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the court-appointed administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the parties. The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien). The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree. The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days. The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting a vote. If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority. Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met: (i) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above; (ii) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated equally and in proportion to their claim or right; (iii) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties; (iv) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e., no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan _de cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved);_ (v) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and (vi) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected. 176 ----- The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). Cross-class cram-down: The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a_ cross-class cram-down mechanism into French law: where the safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties that voted against the plan provided that: (i) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; (ii) the plan has been approved by: (a) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors’ class (créanciers chirographaires); or, if such condition is not met, (b) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment under the order of priority applicable to a judicial liquidation (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession)); (iii) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e., absolute priority rule); (iv) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its claims or interests; (v) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if: (a) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Code de commerce) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and €20 million of net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover; (b) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest under the order of priority applicable to a judicial liquidation (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession)); (c) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, _pro rata_ their shareholding; and (d) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of equity holders. The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes. 177 ----- Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption. As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a timeperiod during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent. If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the _mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent. At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that (i) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or (ii) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met: (a) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a payment in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation or, in the event of a sale of the debtor’s assets as part of a court-ordered disposal plan, were applied; (b) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such class(es) would not have received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation or, in the event of a sale of the debtor’s assets as part of a court-ordered disposal plan, were applied, may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor. In the event no plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed or, in judicial reorganization proceedings only, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see section “Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial _Liquidation Proceedings” below)). Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security_ and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. 178 ----- Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called upon to vote on the proposed plan. _Court-Administered Proceedings - Accelerated Safeguard_ A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) enabling it to implement a restructuring plan in an expedited fashion through a class-based consultation. To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: (i) its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable); (ii) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; (iii) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough parties that will be impaired by such plan to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period which may be extended up to four months upon request from the debtor and the court-appointed administrator; and (iv) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings. The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors alone. If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditors’ classes (see above) to be formed, the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected parties, party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the charteredaccountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing (see section “Status of Creditors _during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”_ below). _Court-Administered Proceedings - Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_ Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of judicial liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above). _De jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be,_ _de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order 179 ----- the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial_ reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), the partial or total disposal of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and the adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows: (i) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator on its own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); (ii) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; (iii) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void. (iv) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide to apply the crossclass cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in addition to the debtor or the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and (v) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails, the approval of the plan may occur through the individual consultation rules (see above). In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization proceedings: (i) in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Code de commerce, the courtappointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan; 180 ----- (ii) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French _Code du travail) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (b) the disappearance_ of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: (a) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or (b) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession). At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: (i) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of_ the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “disposal plan” (plan de cession)), any third 181 ----- party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern market value. The court will tend to favor a credible disposal plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a disposal plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: (a) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; (b) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and (c) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their going-concern market value; or (ii) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (a) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only); (b) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (c) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court orders a disposal plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either: (i) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif); or (ii) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance _d’actif)._ The court may also terminate the proceedings: 182 ----- (i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or (ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. _The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_ The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is determined in the court judgment commencing the proceedings. Failing this, the date of insolvency is deemed to be the date of such court judgment. The court may in any case reconsider the same at a later stage and set an earlier date for the occurrence of insolvency, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of the court judgment commencing the proceedings. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période _suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial_ reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Code civil, security granted for debts previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of a professional receivables (Dailly assignment) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Code de commerce. Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers _détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the_ court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Code de commerce are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”. There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard proceedings. _Creditor Liability_ Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Code de commerce (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of credit facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such credit was wrongful and in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) material interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. 183 ----- _Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_ Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, _diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated 14 January_ 2014, no. 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en _cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. This possibility is excluded in the case_ of accelerated safeguard proceedings. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a disposal plan (plan de cession) as described above. In such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision ordering the disposal plan, as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) required by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier requesting payment directly from the debtor; (iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge; (iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; (v) creditors (or beneficiaries of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (a) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); 184 ----- (b) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed to the creditor; or (c) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings which may be commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); and (vi) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Code de commerce regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Code monétaire et financier or the French Code des assurances and (vii) in the context of reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en _cours), will be required._ A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan or of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court. In accelerated safeguard, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two-month or fourmonth period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors’ representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or chartered certified accountant. 185 ----- Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court orders a disposal plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, postcommencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and public creditors (i.e., taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority is not relevant to all creditors, for example creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset will be treated separately. _Fraudulent Conveyance_ French law contains specific, “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency proceedings. The _action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer as a result of the fraudulent conveyance. 186 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,214
