Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor (as defined above in

The attached Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes

a prospectus for offers of the Notes. The attached Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparties only**
**target market – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target**
market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the
Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

The attached Offering Memorandum is not being distributed by, nor has it been approved by,

**NOTICE TO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA INVESTORS**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any
member state of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the

**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in**
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.
No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in**

made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which
this document relates is available only to and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

THE NOTES MAY NOT BE OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC WITHIN ANY JURISDICTION. BY
ACCEPTING DELIVERY OF THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM, YOU AGREE NOT TO OFFER,
SELL, RESELL, TRANSFER OR DELIVER, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY NOTES TO THE
PUBLIC.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the
UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic
law in the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”)
and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of the Notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client

virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would

as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the
PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
UK has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise
made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in
the UK. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one
(or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

Any distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook
(the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”)
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Notes and determining the appropriate distribution channels.
Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representations or warranties as to a
distributor’s compliance with the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules.

case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies,
plans, objectives, targets, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include
matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering
Memorandum and include statements regarding the Issuer’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations
concerning, among other things, the Group’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity,
prospects, competition in areas of the Group’s business, outlook and growth prospects, strategies and
the industry in which the Group operates.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate
to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. You are cautioned that
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that the Group’s actual results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group
operates may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if the Group’s results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which the Group operates are consistent
with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or
developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors
that could cause those material differences include:

    - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics on the Group’s business;

    - the impact of competition on the Group’s business;

    - the significantly greater financial resources of the Group’s main competitor;

    - the Group’s dependence on the economic conditions in France;

    - the impact of unforeseen events such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or
other catastrophic events;

    - the Group’s dependence on our franchisor and the success of the Burger King brand
worldwide;

    - food safety, food traceability, food borne illness and hygiene-related concerns;

    - the Group’s ability to adopt new ESG policies;

    - the effectiveness of the Group’s marketing and advertising programs and franchisee
support of these programs;

    - the dependence on our corporate reputation and the value and perception of the Burger
King brand;


-----

- the Group’s ability to control franchisees and to implement the Group’s strategic initiatives;

- the Group’s ability to retain franchisees;

- the impact of changes in raw material costs, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating
costs;

- the impact of shortages or interruptions on the availability and delivery of raw materials;

- the impact of higher employment costs;

- the impact of changes in consumer preferences and perceptions;

- the Group’s ability to successfully implement its restaurant development and growth
strategy;

- the lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or decline in the quality of
the locations of the Group’s current restaurants;

- the Group’s ability to renew leases or control rent increases at its restaurant locations, or
obtain leases for new restaurants;

- the Group’s exposure to risks related to litigation and negative publicity, including litigation
with franchisees;

- the Group’s ability to adequately protect its intellectual property;

- the Group’s ability to pursue successful disposals;

- the impact of IT system failures or interruptions or breaches of the Group’s network security;

- the ability to adequately protect the integrity and security of personal information of our
customers and employees;

- the risk of amplified negative publicity due to the increased use of social media;

- the impact of legislation and regulations requiring more transparency in the Group’s
business;

- the Group’s ability to promote its products to its key target market through media
advertising;

- the adoption of new governmental regulations;

- the adoption of new environmental regulations;

-----

    - the adequacy of the Group’s insurance coverage against claims;

    - the Group’s reliance on key executives;

    - tax risks;

    - the impact of tax changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position;

    - the Group’s ability to deduct all or a portion of the interest on its indebtedness incurred in
France;

    - risks related to the Group’s presentation of financial and other information;

    - risks related to the Issuers’ and their subsidiaries’ indebtedness; and

    - risks related to the Notes and the Collateral.

The risks included here are not exhaustive. Moreover, the Group operates in a highly
competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for the Issuers to predict all such risk factors on the Group’s business or the extent to which
any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place
undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, the Issuers also present certain run-rate adjustments
to the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA which model the additional EBITDA the Group would have generated
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 if all of the Burger King restaurants opened or converted
from September 2, 2020 to August 31, 2021 had been operational during an entire twelve-month period.
Such Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection of future performance and investors
should not place undue reliance thereon. Such information is based on mathematical averages of ARS
and certain other estimates and assumptions which are further described under “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance_
_Indicators—Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”._

You are urged to read the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors”,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry”
and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect the Group’s future
performance and the markets in which the Group’s operates. In light of these risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum may
not occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statements were
made. Neither the Issuers nor any of their subsidiaries assumes any obligation to update the
forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum to reflect actual results, changes in
assumptions or changes in factors affecting these statements. All subsequent written and oral
forward-looking statements attributable to the Issuer or its subsidiaries or to persons acting on their
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and
contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk Factors”.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

The SSN Issuer was established in October 2013 as a société par actions simplifiée under the
laws of France in order to lead and develop the Burger King brand in France, carry out the activities
contemplated by the Master Franchise Agreement and serve as the Group’s holding company. The
SSN Issuer prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.

The PIK Issuer was incorporated on April 13, 2018 as a société par actions simplifiée under the
laws of France. The PIK Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations of its own and
whose assets as of June 30, 2021 consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of NewCo GB.
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, NewCo GB is a holding company with no independent
operations of its own and whose assets consist only of its 91% stake in the SSN Issuer. Following the
Post-Closing Merger, whereby NewCo GB will be merged with, and into, the SSN Issuer, the assets of
the PIK Issuer will consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of the SSN Issuer. The PIK Issuer
does not prepare, and does not intend to prepare, consolidated financial statements at the level of the
PIK Issuer.

As a result, this Offering Memorandum instead presents consolidated financial and other data
for the SSN Issuer only.

**Financial Statements**

The financial statements used in this Offering Memorandum are the consolidated financial
statements of the SSN Issuer prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - the standard of the IFRS as adopted
by the European Union applicable to interim financial statements for the six months ended June
30, 2021 (the “Interim Financial Statements”), and in accordance with IFRS for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (collectively, the “Audited Financial Statements” and, together
with the Interim Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”).

During the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, we have adopted certain
accounting standards that may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information
presented herein. For a further description of these accounting standards and the impact of their
adoption on our financial statements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Information_
_Presented—Changes in accounting methods”._

In addition, in 2019 we implemented a carve-out of our Quick activities, as a result of which we
have applied IFRS 5 to our financial statements to reflect the classification of such Quick activities as
discontinued operations from January 1, 2019. As a result of the foregoing, we have restated our 2018
comparative figures to reflect this classification. For a further description, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the_
_Comparability of the Financial Information Presented—Changes in consolidation scope”._

Unless otherwise indicated, the period-to-period comparison of our results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations” are presented on a pre-IFRS 16 including IFRS IC (cancellation of IFRS 16_
entries and rents' recognition) and pre-IFRS 5 (cancellation of the IFRS 5 (discontinued operations)
entries, and addition of the depreciation and amortization related to the assets held for sale as if they
had been maintained) basis (together, the "Restated Financial Information").

In order to provide further detail on the impact of our restatements applied to our reported
financial statements, reconciliations from our reported results of operations and cash flows as of and
for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2020, the year ended December
31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 to the restated figures for such periods, including

iii


-----

IFRS 16 including IFRS IC (cancellation of IFRS 16 entries and rents' recognition), IFRS 5 (cancellation
of the IFRS 5 discontinued operations entries), and the depreciation and amortization related to assets
held for sale (addition of the depreciation and amortization related to the assets held for sale as if they
had been maintained only for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2020
and the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the fact that for the year ended December 31, 2019
the D&A related to the assets held for sale were already included in the reported figures) adjustments
(the “IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC), IFRS 5 and D&A related to assets held for sale Adjustments”),,
have been presented under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations—Reconciliations_ _of our results of operations — Impact of the application of IFRS 16_
(including IFRS IC), IFRS 5 and D&A related to assets held for sale” and “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Reconciliations of our cash flows —_
_Impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC)”. In addition, a reconciliation from our reported_
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the restated figures for such periods has
been provided to reflect the impact of our application of IFRS 5 only. Free English-language translations
of the Financial Statements are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Interim Financial Statements have been subject to a review by KPMG SA and Exelmans
Audit et Conseil, as stated in their report thereon. The Audited Financial Statements have been audited

In addition to the financial measures derived from the IFRS Financial Statements of the SSN
Issuer that are included in this Offering Memorandum, the Issuers have included certain non-IFRS
financial measures of the SSN Issuer, including the Restated Financial Information, EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA, net debt, capital expenditures, as
adjusted net debt, as adjusted financial expense, ratio of as adjusted net debt to Adjusted Run-rate
EBITDA and ratio of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA to as adjusted financial expense and cash conversion
ratio. We also present average restaurant sales (“ARS”) and System-wide sales (“SWS”) for the SSN
Issuer. For definitions and a discussion of these financial measures, see “Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Indicators”._

The Restated Financial Information, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin,
Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA, net debt, capital expenditures, as adjusted net debt, as adjusted financial
expense, ratio of as adjusted net debt to Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and ratio of Adjusted Run-rate
EBITDA to as adjusted financial expense and cash conversion ratio are measures and ratios that do
not comply with IFRS and are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS. Such non-IFRS
measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of other indicators of our
operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance as reported under IFRS. The
SSN Issuer presents these non-IFRS financial measures for informational purposes only and because
we believe that they are widely used by certain investors as supplemental measures of operating
performance, liquidity and ability to service debt. Furthermore, it provides investors the same
information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance.

The Restated Financial Information, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin,
Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA, Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA, net debt, capital expenditures, as adjusted net
debt, as adjusted financial expense, ratio of as adjusted net debt to Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and
ratio of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA to as adjusted financial expense and cash conversion ratio as
presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the section
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the PIK Notes” of this Offering
Memorandum and in the Indentures. They may also have limitations as analytical tools. The Restated
Financial Information included adjustments to tailor recognition and measure methods from those of
IFRS, which is not in accordance with the Rule 100(b) of Regulation G and/or guidance provided in
C&DI 100.04. There is no assurance that items we have identified as non-recurring will not recur in the

i


-----

future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The term “non-recurring” shall not be
construed as being used in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Item 10(c) of Regulation S-K
under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act. The calculations for certain of these non-IFRS measures are
based on various assumptions as further described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. These
amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any
independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not
give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired
businesses or other transactions for the periods presented. It may not be comparable to our
consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

**Rounding**

Certain figures contained in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information, have
been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a
column or a row in tables contained in this Offering Memorandum may not conform exactly to the total
figure given for that column or row.

**Industry and Market Data**

Unless otherwise expressly indicated or noted below, all information regarding markets, market
size, market share, market position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to our business
contained in this Offering Memorandum are based on estimates prepared by us based on certain
assumptions and our knowledge of the industry in which we operate, as well as data from various market
research publications, publicly available information and industry publications, including reports
published by various third-party sources. Industry publications generally state that the information they
contain has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but that the accuracy and
completeness of such information is not guaranteed. The Issuers have not independently verified such
data. Certain information presented under “Industry” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum is
based on and/or derived from data provided by GIRA Foodservice and by The NPD Group, Inc. (“NPD
**Group”) and the Issuers accept responsibility for the correct extraction and reproduction of such**
information from such reports.

In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade
associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market related analysis and
estimates, thereby requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the industry
in which we operate, our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares of various
industry participants based on experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our review
of industry publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. While
we have examined and relied upon certain market or other industry data from external sources as the
basis for our estimates, neither the Issuers nor the Initial Purchasers have verified that data
independently. The Issuers and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you of the accuracy and
completeness of, and take no responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal
estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent source and the
Issuers and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you as to their accuracy. Our estimates involve risks
and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under
“Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements”.

**Overview**

We are Burger King France, resolutely focused on the expansion of the world’s second largest
QSHR chain in the French market which is characterized by secular, long-term demand for eating out
and a strong affinity for our brand. Guided by the Burger King philosophy of “Have it your way”, we offer
customers a differentiated eating experience, combining high-quality food, such as our flame-grilled
hamburgers, with attractive restaurant locations.

In 2013, our principal shareholder Groupe Bertrand reintroduced the Burger King brand to the
French market after a 15-year absence, by signing of an exclusive master franchise agreement between
Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. Groupe Bertrand is a leader
in the French restaurant industry, known for its ability to roll out and transform restaurant concepts.
Following our acquisition in 2015 of Financière Quick Group, an incumbent QSHR operator with nearly
400 prime restaurant locations in France, we demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of
our Burger King network in France, both through the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King
brand, as well as through new Burger King restaurant openings. As of June 30, 2021, we operated
412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be
converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion) and as
of August 31, 2021, we operated 413 restaurants under the Burger King brand (425 restaurants
including nine restaurants under the Quick brand to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term
and three Quick restaurants under conversion).

Our mission is to continue to deliver a high-quality service to our customers and support the
growth of our franchisees through expansion of new Burger King restaurants. We are committed to strict
development criteria, prioritizing sustainable initiatives and seeking to exploit economies of scale to
further growing our EBITDA. Our business model features a mix of predominantly Franchise with Lease
Management Restaurants and Pure Franchise Restaurants, and to a lesser extent Company
Restaurants. We believe this model enables us to manage our growth flexibly while controlling the
locations of the restaurants in our network. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 83% of our Burger King
restaurants are Franchise Restaurants under our Burger King brand and the remaining 17% are
Company Restaurants, a balance that supports our gross margin and reduces our capital expenditure
requirement for expansion. As of June 30, 2021, we were the direct lessee for or owner of approximately
87% of the restaurant locations in our network, compared to 85% of the restaurant locations in our
network as of December 31, 2018.

In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s,
KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked
customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. The strong recognition of
the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide,
serves as a solid base to attract customers and prospective franchisees.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) for Burger
King restaurants was approximately €2.8 million.

-----

We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with locations throughout the country and
approximately 15% market share by sales of burgers in 2021 (up from 8% in 2017), generating
€1,056.7 million in SWS (reported), €448.3 million in revenue and €151.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA
(reported) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, with 412 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 (399
of which were under the Burger King brand).

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_Attractive and resilient market in France with steady growth characteristics_**

We believe that the QSR market in France benefits from strong and sustainable growth
characteristics with demonstrated resilience through business cycles, as well as in the face of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The QSR segment has historically experienced a steady growth rate in France,
and we believe that it has significant untapped potential. According to GIRA Foodservice, absolute sales
in the French QSR market grew at a CAGR of 6.8% per annum between 2017 and 2019 from
approximately €17.1 billion in 2017 to €19.5 billion in 2019. The QSR market has historically been the
key driver of growth in the OOH market, with a CAGR of 6.8% between 2017 and 2019, compared to a
CAGR of 3.5% for the commercial restaurants and a CAGR of 3.0% for the total OOH). Based on GIRA
Foodservice, the QSR market also increased its share of the commercial restaurants market from 32%
in 2017 to 41% in 2020. Although QSR market sales temporarily decreased in 2020 due to the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic in absolute terms (decreasing by 31.2% between 2019 and 2020), according
to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, sales have significantly increased by 10.6% in the first half of
2021 compared to the same period during the prior year.

The QSHR category in the broader QSR market also exhibited growth throughout these same
periods. QSHR is the largest category within the broader QSR segment and has been a significant
driver of the growth in the French QSR market. According to GIRA Foodservice, sales in the QSHR
market grew at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2017 and 2019, from approximately €6.9 billion in 2017 to
€8.1 billion in 2019. As with the QSR segment as a whole, the QSHR market temporarily decreased in
2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit at a lower rate than the QSR market. We
observed the relative resilience of the QSR market and outperformance of the QSHR market during
COVID-19 compared to the total commercial restaurants/total OOH, with a decrease of 22.9% in
absolute sale in the QSHR segment and 31.2% in the QSR segment versus 42.2% for the total
commercial and 37.7% for the total OOH in 2020 compared to 2019. Notwithstanding this temporary
decrease in 2020, according to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, the QSHR market's sales
increased by 29.7% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period during the prior year. Based
on GIRA Foodservice, its share in the QSR market increased from 40% in 2017 to 47% in 2020. In
addition, GIRA Foodservice expects sales in the QSR segment to exceed 2019 levels in 2022, with
projected sales amounting to €20.6 billion in 2022 as compared to €19.5 billion in 2019. GIRA
Foodservice expects the QSR market to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.8%, between 2019 and
2023, compared to a growth at a CAGR of approximately 0.6% in the overall commercial restaurants
sector in France, which is expected to increase its sales from approximately €56.4 billion in 2016 to
€57.7 billion in 2023.

We believe the French QSR market has significant penetration potential and that we are poised
to take advantage of this growth. The QSR market in France, which was a €19.5 billion market in 2019,
has a lower penetration rate than other Western European countries, although it is growing fast and
roughly in line with the growth rates in such other countries. For example, the QSR market grew in
France at a rate of 7.4% between 2018 and 2019 and the QSHR category grew at a rate of 9.3% over
the same period. Further, we believe there is significant whitespace potential in France based on the
average annual commercial foodservice spend per inhabitant in France (€640), which in the year 2017
was much lower as compared to its neighboring countries, such as the United Kingdom (€831) or
Belgium (€842), according to GIRA Foodservice. The French market is generally characterized by more
stringent anti-competition regulations than other Western European markets, limiting the number of
chains in operation in France, which could prevent new market entrants. In addition, we believe that our

2


-----

successful business model serves as a barrier to entry because brand equity and prime locations
throughout mainland France cannot be easily replicated by new entrants due to the significant
investment levels required and the necessary time to attain our economies of scale, operational and
logistics know-how. As a result, through our established presence in the French market, we believe we
have a strong competitive advantage in the face of potential competitors or new market entrants.

This long-term growth potential is underpinned by structural changes in customer habits and
way of life, which we believe are favorable for QSR restaurant operators. These trends include
increasing digital penetration and out-of-home convenience-oriented food consumption, favoring value
for money, preferences for health-conscious and quality product offerings and the expansion of daypart
opportunities. Such structural trends in French society foster an increased demand for the QSR
segment. According to NPD, there has been a 5 percentage points growth in share of restaurant chains
to 61% as of March 2021 year on year. Furthermore, 46% of French people name attractive price as
their main selection criteria for a restaurant. Certain of these favorable trends were accelerated as a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, customers have more increasingly relied
on digital channels (such as home delivery and Click & Collect options) and convenient and affordable
dining options. According to NPD, the QSR share of commercial restaurants digital orders is now 81%
with a 22% growth in digital orders as of March 2021 year on year. Approximately 90% of Burger King
France restaurants offer Click & Collect following the launch in 2020. Customers have also
demonstrated their loyalty to strong brands that successfully address the aforementioned evolving
preferences. See “Industry”.

**_Well-established leading market position underpinned by a distinctive global brand and high_**
**_local recognition_**

We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with approximately 15% market share by
sales in the first half of 2021 according to the NPD Group, which has almost doubled in comparison to
our 8% market share in 2017. Our market position is supported by our extensive and growing restaurant
network. In the last few years, the sizes of our respective Burger King brand network and franchise
network have significantly expanded, with our Burger King brand network almost doubling from 203
restaurants as of December 31, 2017 to 399 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 and our franchise network
for Burger King restaurants increasing from 158 franchise restaurants as of December 31, 2017 to 330
franchise restaurants as of June 30, 2021. Throughout these periods, our Group has also demonstrated
strong sales per unit, with ARS for the year ended December 31, 2019 of €3.2 million.

Our leading market position in France is underpinned by the distinctive Burger King global
brand and high local recognition in France. We are Burger King’s master franchisee in France and are
well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the
restaurant industry worldwide. Burger King is the world’s second largest QSHR chain in terms of total
number of restaurants with over 18,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The chain had more
than $20.0 billion of SWS for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a Burger King master franchisee
we benefit from Burger King’s international brand awareness, its distinctive product offer, unique
cooking method, efficient and reliable supply chains and food quality reputation. We also benefit from
Burger King's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and
generate increased footfall in our restaurants. Over the years, Burger King has launched innovative and
creative multimedia advertising campaigns that highlight the popular relevance of the Burger King brand
globally.

We believe we are well positioned to further increase our market position by closing the market
share gap between ourselves and McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, which held 69% market
share as of the first half of 2021 Our strong brand awareness and growing market share are supported
by our high-quality and innovative product offering, our focus on expanding digital convenience options
for our customers and our unique local communication strategy. Our focus on innovation in terms of
digital convenience for our customers has further contributed to the strengthening of our market share.
Following the launch of home delivery and Click & Collection options respectively in 2019 and in 2020,
our market share of digital sales (measured by the number of transactions) steadily increased to 14%
as of March 2021. In addition, we also expanded our digital sales channel in 2020 through the mobile

3


-----

Burger King app, which now includes our expanded customer loyalty program. Our Burger King app
was downloaded on average 5,000 times a day during the first six months of 2021 and has increased
to a daily download rate of 10,000 times a day during promotions. Our Kingdom loyalty program had
more than 3.6 million registered members as of the end of September 2021. In addition, over the last
few years we have expanded home delivery options through our partnerships with home delivery
services such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. Our rate of home delivery increased by four times
from 15 transactions per day per restaurant in July and August 2019 to more than 60 transactions per
day per restaurant in July and August 2021. We expect the volume of our digital sales to increase, along
with growth in the French QSR market and as digital penetration grows in line with increased focus on
digital convenience.

We enjoy strong brand recognition in France, supported by customer's perception of the taste
and quality of our products according to KANTAR. In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among
QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a
KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these
QSR brands. In addition, we invest annually (through contributions from both our Company Restaurants
and Franchise Restaurants) in innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns at the French
national level, which we believe reinforce Burger King’s growing brand awareness in France and have
a positive impact on our level of SWS. According to an IFOP (Institut français d'opinion publique) survey
on the French population, our brand awareness has improved in France from 72% Spontaneous
Awareness in 2018 to 83% in 2021 while our Total Brand Awareness has remained stable reflecting
91% in both 2018 and 2021. In addition, according to KANTAR, our brand equity has also improved,
with an increase in the power of our brand equity from 18 in March 2018 to 21 in April 2021 (out an
index of 100). The strong and growing recognition of the Burger King brand in France, together with
Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide, serves as a solid base to further increase our
market share.

**_Broad footprint and diversified channel mix with strong digital and contactless capabilities_**

Our extensive restaurant network reflects a balanced approach of different formats and sizes
appropriately tailored for each of the locations in which we operate. We choose our restaurant sites
carefully and have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process that incorporates our
management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our
restaurant development team has extensive experience identifying and evaluating suitable restaurant
locations. As of June 30, 2021, we operated a network of 412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants
under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the shortterm and two Quick restaurants under conversion). At each of our sites, we select and develop one of
three of our principal restaurant formats: a free-standing drive-through facility format, a downtown
format and a shopping center or mall format. As of June 30, 2021, 328 of our restaurants reflected a
drive-through facility format, 39 of our restaurants reflected a downtown format, 26 of our restaurants
reflected a shopping center or mall format and 19 restaurants reflected other formats (including
restaurants located in travel locations such as airports, train stations and highway service concessions).
For our drive-through facility restaurants, which have historically represented our largest restaurant
type, we have developed three different restaurants sizes to best address market potential. We are also
focused on ensuring that most of our restaurant locations are well-suited to offer both take away and
home delivery services to our customers.

We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed complementary multi-channel
offerings that we believe have favorably positioned us to respond to evolving customer trends.
Particularly, we believe our multi-channel offering has underpinned the resilience of our business
(including during COVID-19) and maximize customer reach. Our customers can access our product
offer through multiple channels, including on-site through in-restaurant dining or drive-through orders,
online through Click & Collect services (which include services for on-site Click & Collect pick up through
our parking lots or drive-through lines or home delivery) and home delivery services (either through
third-party aggregators such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. In addition, we intend to begin to
roll out our own home-delivery services in certain locations, which we believe demonstrate an
opportunity to further develop our multi-channel approach.

A breakdown comparing our SWS by channel for the December 2019 and August 2021 period
are reflected in the chart below:

We have further optimized our restaurants and customer journey with a number of digital
initiatives that are consistent across all of our channels to better cater to our customers and improve
their dining experience. For example, we have enhanced our drive-through experience by accelerating
the order process through the use of digital tablets in our drive-through sites. All our restaurants have
been equipped with in-store kiosks since 2015. Since 2019, our drive-through capacity has doubled
based on the average number of cars per hour that passed through the drive-through. We have also
developed our mobile app to allow for Click & Collect orders directly in-app to facilitate easy ordering.
To further improve customers' in-dining experience, in 2021 we rolled out geolocalized table service in
approximately 250 restaurant locations, allowing dine-in customers to receive their meals directly at
their table and further supporting market share gains in the key target family demographic. As of the
date hereof, table service is available in more than half of our restaurant network, and we are targeting
the implementation of this service in approximately 80% to 90% of our restaurant network by the end of
2022. Customers can also now register purchases to their loyalty programs via scanner capabilities on
every touch point in order to facilitate customer identification. Thanks to our single PoS IT system that
is fully integrated across all of our network and distribution channels, we are able to achieve futureproof and scalable state-of-the-art operations monitoring and process management.

**_Agile business model with best-in-class operational expertise_**

We believe navigating the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated
the strength and resiliency of our business model and our ability to respond quickly to unprecedented
business disruption. At the on-set of the pandemic, our management team rapidly implemented various
cash management measures to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our operations and
liquidity position. Our management team prioritized various initiatives to strengthen our liquidity position,
including by drawing in full our Existing Revolving Credit Facility for a total of €60 million and entering
into the state-guaranteed PGE Loan (contrat de prêts garantis par l’État français) for a total of €80
million. In addition, in an effort to manage cash during the restrictive periods of the pandemic, we ceased
most external service expenditures such as cleaning, security and maintenance, both in our restaurants
and at our headquarters, and temporarily renegotiated our rental obligations of certain of our Company
Restaurants and supported our franchisees in the renegotiations of their rental obligations for certain
periods with our landlords. As a result, we were able to maintain a strong level of free cash flow since
the start of the pandemic. Further, we were focused on supporting our franchisees through the
challenges of the pandemic and closely monitored their financial health, adapting our support initiatives
as the impact of the pandemic on our franchisees' performance evolved. For example, during the period

5


-----

of the first lockdown in France, we implemented temporary royalty adjustments for our franchisees. We
also temporarily waived the obligation of our franchisees to pay us a minimum lease management fee.
As a result of such measures, none of our franchisees experienced a default of their payment obligations
to third parties.

We further believe that our strong restaurant-level operations coupled with our tight cost control
and disciplined cash management have allowed us to further enhance our resilient model to withstand
any future crises. In response to the pandemic, we implemented robust operational protocols to safely
continue our activity in compliance with government restrictions. While our restaurant opening plan was
impacted by the pandemic, we were still able to open a number of new restaurants during the COVID19 period and plan to continue to carry out the final conversions from the few remaining Quick
restaurants to the Burger King brand, which we believe demonstrates the confidence of our franchisees
and the strength of our strategy.

In addition, in continuation of our digital strategy and to cope with external restrictions, we
further enhanced our multi-channel offerings, including through the expansion of our drive-through and
takeaway services by using new Click & Collect channels as of July 2020, the development of our home
delivery options and our integration with third-party delivery aggregators. The further enhancement of
such offerings allowed us to protect our top line during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions by offsetting
the reduction in on-premise customer traffic and allowing customers to access our products through
alternate channels. Following the return of on-premises dining with the easing of COVID-19 lockdown
measures, we continue to benefit from the robust contribution of our off-premises channels, such as
delivery and Click & Collect options. We also regularly and proactively communicated with our
customers, which had a positive impact on our brand image. In response to a KANTAR survey in April
2021 which asked to what extent customers' image of fast food brands has improved, maintained or
gotten worse in the last months of the COVID-19 pandemic, 25% of respondents indicated that Burger
King had improved. Pursuant to the survey results, Burger King's operations reflected the highest
proportion of responses indicating improvement as compared to other fast food chains in France that
were mentioned in the survey, including McDonald's, KFC, Domino's and Subway. In addition to the
foregoing measures, we remained committed throughout the pandemic periods to our ESG best
practices, including introducing menu innovations that were healthy and nutritious, such as the launch
of our bowls and plant based offerings, and our continued efforts to enhance our supply chain with local
sourcing and pro-environment initiatives.

We believe that our SWS before and after each of the most severe COVID-19-related restrictive
periods in France (i.e., the first and second lockdowns in March to May 2020 and October to December
2020) demonstrate our ability to rapidly ramp up and down, with monthly sales immediately following
each lockdown nearly recovering to pre-lockdown periods. For example, in June 2020, our SWS under
the Burger King brand recovered to €73 million as compared to the €85 million pre-lockdown level in
February 2020. Similarly, in December 2020, the month during which the second lockdown restrictions
were lifted, our SWS reached €86 million as compared to the €94 million pre-lockdown SWS recorded
in October 2020. Further, despite the implementation of a curfew in France ending in June 2021, we
were able to achieve consistently increasing SWS levels from April 2021 through August 2021, which
we believe emphasizes the resilience of our business model, further supported by the long-term
integration of the measures we adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a demonstration
of this resilience our SWS in the months following the easing of lockdown restrictions in July and August
2021 reached historically record levels.

A breakdown of our SWS for each of our channels over the course of first lockdown, second
lockdown and post-lockdown periods is presented below:

Further, a breakdown of our monthly SWS during the period beginning January 1, 2020 through
August 31, 2021, as well as a breakdown of our quarterly EBITDA over those same periods, as
compared to the corresponding periods in 2019 is presented below:

**_Asset-light business model with high cash conversion_**

Our successful franchise-based business model, including a robust network of committed
franchise partners, generates recurring and predictable revenues with high EBITDA margin. As of June
30, 2021, 83% of our Burger King network restaurants were Franchise Restaurants under our Burger
King brand (compared to 70% as of December 31, 2016), with 17% of our restaurants operated as
Company Restaurants (compared to 30% as of December 31, 2016). While our previous strategy was
focused on the conversion of Quick restaurants and the progressive switch toward franchise
restaurants, our current approach reflects a continuous focus on franchising most of our restaurants (29
out of 30 restaurant openings were franchise restaurants over the six-month period ended June 30,

7


-----

2021), and we are now moving from conversions to new openings. This asset-light model allows for
higher cash conversion and reduces or eliminates for locations with third-party landlord agreements our
capital expenditures for such franchise openings. The table below demonstrates our enhanced cash
conversion (measured as pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA minus restaurant opening and conversion capex divided
by pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA) in recent years following our adoption of an asset-light franchise-focused
model for new restaurant openings, as compared to prior years. Our annual cash conversion ratio
increased from 4%, 2% and 19%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and
2018, as compared to 73%, 59% and 74%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and the twelve months ended August 31, 2021.

We believe that our "asset-light" operating model generates enhanced cash conversion and
significant recurring free cash flow primarily driven by royalties and lease payments collected from
franchisees based on sales levels, while limiting our capital expenditures. The corporate infrastructure
and capital expenditures necessary to support a franchise business model are substantially less than a
company-operated system, as franchisees and landlords assume most capital expenditure costs. In
particular, most of our openings are operated by franchisees under a lease management contract, and
when this franchise model is combined with third party landlord agreements we bear no capital
expenditure. We expect the continued success of our asset-light operating model, underpinned by the
completion of most of our Quick conversions pursuant to the disposal of most of our Quick restaurants
(see “Business—Our Business—Quick Disposal”) and our continued preference for the Franchise with
Lease Management arrangements combined where possible with third party landlord agreements.

In addition, our franchise-based model allows us to retain strong control over our network
through our standard agreements with our franchisees, which govern various aspects of our
relationship, including the royalties and fees due by them to us. We believe that our franchise model
offers us favorable upsides and that our emphasis on growing this model in the future will continue to
drive high cash conversion.

**_Seasoned management team with a proven track-record supported by shareholders_**
**_experienced in our industry_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our senior management team. We
are led by our Managing Director, Jérôme Tafani, who joined the Group in February 2016 and previously
served as Executive Director for Chipotle Mexican Grill Europe and worked for more than 20 years at
McDonald’s, where he held several financial and operations positions before being appointed Managing
Director for France and Corporate Senior Vice President for Europe. Our Chief Financial Officer, Xavier
Cottineau, joined the Group in September 2016 after serving as Chief Financial Officer at Financière
Louis, as Finance Vice President at EuroDisney and senior financial auditor at
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our experienced management team has a long and successful history with
a proven track record of developing, integrating and operating in the QSR segment and has managed
to lead our Group through evolutions to its business model, support our Group's growing network
(including its organic growth trajectory) and execute M&A transactions to further our business
strategies. Our management team has also successfully managed our business through challenges

8


-----

that accompanied evolving government regulations and customer behavior in the face of the COVID19 crisis, and guided the recovery of our operations to strong levels following the easing of COVID-19
related restaurant closure measures.

We also benefit from the support and expertise of our significant shareholders, Groupe
Bertrand, which is a leading French operator of restaurant chains, and Bridgepoint, which is an
international alternative assed fund management group. Each of our shareholders provides us with
long-term support through their respective and complementary expertise. Groupe Bertrand was
founded by Olivier Bertrand more than 20 years ago. Groupe Bertrand has created and managed a fast
growing restaurant franchise group in France, with over 900 restaurants (both franchises and owned
restaurants) under management. Groupe Bertrand has demonstrated that it considers network
development over the long term, applies a cautious approach to risk management and enjoys a strong
entrepreneurial culture, which serve as further support to our senior management. Bridgepoint joined
as minority shareholder of our Group in July 2018 to further support the development of the Burger King
brand alongside Groupe Bertrand.

**Our Strategy**

Our objective is to grow our business and increase profitability by implementing the following
strategies:

**_Continue to take advantage of attractive market fundamentals_**

We intend to continue leveraging our extensive and prime-location restaurant network and
existing broad range of products, which covers value promotion menus and premium limited time
offerings to drive profitable restaurant sales and traffic. We also seek to expand our product offering by
relying on our expertise in creating innovative, premium convenience food products that match
customers’ demand, which we believe will be a key driver of our revenues. For example, we intend to
continue to expand our healthy and nutritious product offering through the introduction of additional
healthy options and preservative-free ingredients to further capture key markets, such as families, and
anticipate market trends toward local sourcing, value-for-money products and healthy food options as
well as meatless alternatives and products with no animal protein. We also plan to further strengthen
our multi-channel approach through the enhancement of takeaway options and the development of new
digital sales channels to further drive our growth. Finally, we intend to capitalize on increased
consumption opportunities by the continued operation of our restaurants in the afternoon or late-night
hours. We believe that we will continue to benefit from the support that BKC provides through its menu
items, product enhancements and reimaging initiatives, which combined with our continuous innovation
and operational expertise, will help drive overall consumption levels in the currently
moderately-penetrated French QSR segment.

**_Enhanced focus on digital transformation_**

We intend to increase our market share of digital sales in the QSR market through the continued
development and maintenance of our best-in-class multi-channel offering. We plan to continue to make
improvements to our existing digital sales channels in order to maintain and increase our digital sales,
while also developing additional innovative and convenient digital capabilities. While we have already
successfully integrated the use of in-app orders and pre-orders, Click & Collect orders, in-store tablets
that allow customers to skip the line and home delivery options with third-party aggregators, we also
see opportunity in expanding our digital channels, through, for example, white-label delivery. We believe
that the current trends and growth observed in our digital sales, accelerated as a result of the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate a distribution channel that adapts to the changing preferences
of our customers and is complementary to our in-restaurant dining channel. Further improving and
increasing sales through our digital channel will enable us to capture an additional segment of the
market by offering customers an easy and convenient dining option.

-----

**_Continue our commitment to sustainability and focus on improving our ESG performance_**

Improving our ESG initiatives and growing our network while prioritizing sustainability initiatives
is central to our business. Our key strategic ESG pillars include: (i) adapting our product offering to
address future global challenges, (ii) promoting the well-being of our teams and (iii) limiting our
environmental impact. With respect to our product offering, we intend to continue to promote local and
quality product sourcing, innovate our offer to provide healthy and responsible food options (through,
for example, a full permanent range of plant-based burgers, wraps, salads and sandwiches without
animal protein) and apply stringent safety standards to our operations. In promoting the well-being of
our teams, our goal is to create an inclusive workplace with frequent staff trainings and an emphasis on
fighting against harassment. We are also focused on limiting our environmental impact through waste
management initiatives, continued improvement of our logistics services and responsible growth of our
business.

We also seek to prioritize ESG initiatives in order to create and share value with our
stakeholders. For example, our New Revolving Credit Facility, to be entered into on or about the Issue
Date, will be based on sustainability-linked terms for its margin. In addition, we have adopted Burger
King's global ESG guidelines with an aim to exceed the baseline standards promoted therein.

**_Expand our restaurant network and profitably increase our market share_**

We believe there is significant untapped demand for the Burger King offering across France,
supporting the potential to continue our successful expansion strategy. Our network of Burger King
brand restaurants expanded from 16 as of December 31, 2014 to 399 as of June 30, 2021. Following
the Quick Disposal, we expect our network to increase, with over 400 targeted locations already
identified, providing us with significant room for further growth, particularly in light of the moderatelypenetrated French QSR market. For example, McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, has a
denser network of restaurants in France than Burger King, with approximately 1,500 restaurants (as of
June 2021) for McDonald’s, compared to 412 restaurants (as of June 2021) for Burger King (including
399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed
in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion). We believe we are well-positioned to
close the network density gap between ourselves and McDonald's and to further increase our market
positioning.

We plan to further expand our Burger King brand restaurant network in collaboration with
current and new franchisees to continue to increase our market share in the French QSHR category.
We expect that a higher density of restaurants will further contribute to brand awareness, support
customer loyalty and increase traffic in our existing restaurants, while our new restaurants will benefit
from our strong brand, reputation and know-how. We have a rigorous approach to expansion and expect
to promote new restaurant growth through the opening of Franchise with Lease Management
Restaurants, which allow us to retain a high degree of control over our network of restaurants, with
limited capital expenditure. Opening Company Restaurants requires significantly higher capital
expenditures and adds leases and personnel costs to our cost structure, whereas in franchise
arrangements, the cost impact of adding a new Franchise Restaurant is significantly reduced. As a
result, we intend to control the number of new Company Restaurants.

**_Focus on cost control and economies of scale_**

We intend to continue to improve our gross margin and profitable expansion through the
optimization of our supply chain and marketing. While Franchisees bear the food and logistic costs for
their restaurants, we organize and negotiate the sourcing for both Company and Franchise restaurants.
We source a wide range of ingredients, including beef and chicken, potatoes and other fresh and frozen
products and a variety of sauces to form our menu and we also incur logistics costs to store inventory
and transport raw materials and semi-finished products to such restaurant locations. Our food and
logistics costs are significant, and we believe that we could drive our gross margin through enhanced
control of our logistics costs by exploiting economies of scale in line with the growth of our restaurant
network, further developing local supplier networks and implementing cost control measures to reduce

10


-----

food waste. For example, we require all of our Burger King franchisees to source their raw materials
from suppliers that BKC has previously approved and with whom we intend to continue to leverage our
extensive restaurant network and economies of scale to obtain the most favorable commercial terms.
In addition, suppliers have sought to invest in long-term partnerships with us, which has allowed us to
reduce food costs and secure dedicated product lines to satisfy our needs. We also intend to enter into
exclusive deals with our suppliers, such as with Coca Cola or Nutella, driven by our brand image and
growth prospects.

Apart from focusing on the optimization of our supply chain, we intend to further develop our
communication and advertising campaigns to promote our brands, product offerings and commercial
offers in order to reinforce awareness of the Burger King brand, build on our image and increase
customer traffic, which we believe will also contribute to the improvement of our gross margin and
profitable expansion. As a result of our growing network and presence in France, we believe we will
have improved media buying conditions, allowing us to obtain a higher return on our marketing
expenses.

**_Drive EBITDA growth and cash generation to support deleveraging_**

Our franchise model, combined with an asset-light approach for a significant share of new
openings, is a pillar to our deleveraging strategy. We will continue to deploy this model with a
preference, where possible, for opening Franchise with Lease Management restaurants that permit us
to actively manage our network, target specific whitespace and encourage the formation of denser
clusters of restaurants, as well as to limit swings in our working capital. Where possible we will also
favor third party landlord agreements allowing us to effectively reduce our new opening capex spend to
nothing with a majority of our new openings under the asset-light model lease management. In addition,
we believe that tight cash control measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
coupled with the strong cash buffer built and maintained through the crisis, will allow us to continue
focusing on deleveraging in the periods to come.

**Recent Developments**

**_Quick Disposal_**

On July 29, 2021, Financière BKF (formerly Financière Quick) entered into an agreement (the
“Quick Securities Sale Agreement”) with funds controlled by H.I.G. Capital for the disposal of the
remaining 107 restaurants that the Group was operating under the Quick brand, excluding 11 Quick
restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short term and in respect of which we would be
able to continue using the “Quick” name until December 31, 2023 pursuant the Quick License
Agreement (as defined below)), through the sale of 100% of the shares of Quick Restaurants S.A., an
indirect subsidiary of the SSN Issuer (the “Quick Disposal”) . The consideration payable by the
purchaser under the Quick Securities Sale Agreement shall be equal to a base amount of approximately
€245.0 million (including the Vendor Loan). On closing, the purchaser shall pay to Financière BKF the
sum of the Base Amount and the Earn-Out Amount, less a vendor loan of €5 million (the “Vendor
**Loan”). The Vendor Loan bears 5% PIK interest and shall be junior to the purchaser’s third party debt**
financing but senior to the equity and/or quasi equity of the purchaser. The Vendor Loan is repayable
upon certain events and otherwise by no later 6 months after the maturity of the purchaser’s debt
financing.

The Quick Securities Sale Agreement contains (i) customary representations and warranties
from Financière BKF as seller to the purchaser (which, for certain representations and warranties, are
subject to the purchaser’s commitment to subscribe to a W&I insurance), and (ii) a 5-year undertaking
from the seller group not to be engaged in quick service restaurants selling exclusively or predominantly
Halal burgers (subject to exceptions) and not to use the “Giant” name. Prior to entering into the Quick
Securities Sale Agreement, the restaurants operated by the Group under the Quick brand had been
transferred under a specific subgroup headed by Quick Restaurants S.A., and had been classified as
discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements since January 1, 2019 in accordance
with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the_
_Comparability of the Financial Information Presented—Changes in consolidation scope”. The sale_
closed on October 8, 2021, generating approximately €245.0 million of proceeds (including the Vendor

Pursuant to the Quick Securities Sale Agreement, on October 8, 2021, France BKR (formerly
France Quick SAS, a subsidiary of Financière BKF), Quick Restaurants SA and Quick Services SAS (a
subsidiary of Quick Restaurants SA) entered into a license agreement (the “Quick License
**Agreement”) whereby Quick Restaurants SA and Quick Services SAS granted France BKR a non-**
exclusive and irrevocable license, with sub-licensable rights, of the Quick brand, which France BKR will
use to continue to operate certain restaurants in France under the Quick brand until they are
progressively converted to the Burger King brand, closed or sold, under certain agreed conditions.

**_Restaurant openings and conversions since June 30, 2021_**

During the months of July, August and September 2021, we opened 15 new Burger King
restaurants and converted two restaurants from the Quick brand to the Burger King brand. In addition,
at the end of September 2021, three restaurants that had been operating under the Quick brand
temporarily closed for conversion into the Burger King brand. In July 2021, we opened our 400[th]
restaurant under the Burger King brand.

_The following discussion has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management and_
_is solely based on preliminary financial information and operating data used by management. There_
_can be no assurance that these estimates will be realized or that actual results will not be higher or_
_lower than estimated. The preliminary financial results presented below are based on unaudited_
_management information and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our consolidated_
_financial or operational results. This information has been prepared by management. Our independent_
_auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the_
_accompanying preliminary financial results for the purpose of their inclusion herein._

_The preliminary financial results set out below are based on a number of assumptions that are_
_subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. While we believe the preliminary financial_
_results to be reasonable, our actual results for such period may vary from the preliminary financial_
_results presented below, and these variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue_
_reliance on the inclusion of the preliminary financial results in this document, it should not be regarded_
_as an indication that such preliminary financial results will be an accurate prediction of future events,_
_and such information should not be relied on as such. See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk_
_Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”_
_for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and_
_results of operations._

Based on preliminary management accounts, we expect our SWS for the eight months ended
August 31, 2021, to be approximately €907.2 million (€755.0 million from our continued operations and
€152.2 million from our discontinued operations), compared to €661.3 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2020 (€543.0 million from our continued operations and €118.3 million from our discontinued
operations). We believe the principal factors driving the growth in SWS for the eight months ended

12


-----

August 31, 2020, were the strong rebound in activity and accelerated recovery of our operations
following the easing of COVID-19-related lockdown measures beginning in May 2021, as well as new
restaurant openings during this period. Further, we believe that the robust performance of delivery,
drive-through and takeaway channels compensated for the reduction of on-premises traffic in our
restaurants. Based on our preliminary accounts, we expect that the months of July and August 2021
each demonstrated record monthly SWS levels for the Burger King brand in France. In addition,
according to management's analysis of preliminary management accounts, we expect our post-IFRS16
EBITDA for the eight months ended August 31, 2021 to be approximately €126.4 million (€104.8 million
from our continued operations and €21.6 million from our discontinued operations), compared to €68.3
million for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 (€53.3 million from our continued operations and
€15.0 million from our discontinued operations), reflecting an EBITDA for the continued operations for
the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 of €160.9 million. Despite the impact of COVID-19
restrictions on our operations, we expect our SWS and EBITDA for the eight months ended August 31,
2021, to approach 2019 pre-COVID levels. Further, based on preliminary management accounts, we
expect our Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA to be €176.1 million for the twelve months ended August 31,
2021.

New Revolving Credit Facility, for general corporate and working capital purposes. The New Revolving Credit Facility will
be guaranteed within 120 days after the Issue Date by the SSN Guarantors. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be
secured substantially simultaneously with the same collateral granted to secure the obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility”. Pursuant to the Intercreditor

the PIK Offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom,
the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries accounted for approximately 100% of its
total revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and held
approximately 100% of its total assets and approximately 100% of its
total liabilities as of June 30, 2021 (other than the PIK Notes offered
hereby). In addition, as of August 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis
after giving effect to the PIK Offering and the application of the net
proceeds therefrom, the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries had €1,135.4
million of indebtedness.

The summary unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of and for the six months

The following section contains non-IFRS measures that are not required by, or presented in

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information”.

The unaudited consolidated income statement and the other financial information presented for

**Reconciliation of Certain Restated Financial Data**

In order to provide prospective investors with the same information that we use internally for
purposes of assessing our operating performance, we have prepared reconciliations from our reported
results of operations and cash flows for the periods under review to the restated figures for such periods.
For a further description of the restatements applied to our reported financial statements, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors

_Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Information Presented—Changes in accounting methods”._
In addition, in 2019, we implemented a carve-out of our Quick activities, as a result of which we have
applied IFRS 5 to our financial statements to reflect the classification of such Quick activities as
discontinued operations from the period beginning January 1, 2019. As a result of the foregoing, we
have restated our 2018 comparative figures to reflect this classification. For a further description, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors
_Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Information Presented—Changes in consolidation scope”._

In order to provide further detail on the impact of our restatements applied to our reported
financial statements, reconciliations from our reported results of operations and cash flows as of and
for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2020, the year ended December

of the Quick Carve-Out as discontinued operations and include for 2020 and 2021 the (c) depreciation and amortization
related to assets held for sale.

(5) “EBITDA” is defined as net profit/(loss) for the period, excluding the results of discontinued operations, before income tax

expenses, net financial income/(expenses), share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method, other
income/(expenses) from non-recurring items, headquarters depreciation and amortization and restaurants depreciation and
amortization. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information”. The “other
income/(expenses) from non-recurring items” are described in note 6.4 to the Interim Financial Statements, an English
language translation of which is included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The term “non-recurring” shall not be
construed as being used in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Item 10(c) of Regulation S-K under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act.

(6) “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA less pre-opening costs. Pre-opening costs refer to costs incurred prior to the

opening of a new restaurant, including rent incurred prior to opening, wages of employees in training and food costs incurred
for training of new employees.

The following table presents a bridge of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation from our reported results
of operations to the restated figures for the periods presented, reflecting IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC), IFRS 5 and D&A

potential future results. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information”.

The table below sets forth our Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 and a reconciliation
of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA to EBITDA.

We calculate Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA in the following manner:

(a) Represents the Group’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of August 31, 2021, excluding the EBITDA generated by

discontinued activities as the starting point of the Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA calculation.

(b) Represents the restaurant operating EBITDA of the Burger King restaurants that were either opened or converted

during Run-Rate Period, and which generated an EBITDA during the twelve months ended August 31, 2021.

35


-----

(c) Represents the restaurant operating EBITDA of the Burger King restaurants that were opened or converted during the

Run-rate Period as if they were operational during a twelve-month period. To do so, we calculate an estimate of the
sales that would have been generated in a twelve-month period as an estimated ARS of €2.8 million (which is in line
with the €2.8 million of ARS we generated for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021). We then apply this ARS to the
restaurants in the sample by applying a cost margin or EBITDA margin, as applicable, to the estimated ARS based on
the type of restaurant included in the sample, as follows:

**Company Restaurants: for the four new Burger King Company Restaurants opened or converted in the**
sample, we apply a cost margin to the estimated ARS, calculated on the basis of the actual restaurant costs
of the entire Burger King Company Restaurant network; and

**Franchise Restaurants: for the 62 new Burger King Franchise Restaurants opened or converted in the**
sample, we apply an EBITDA margin to the estimated ARS, calculated on the basis of the underlying
franchise arrangement of each model, i.e., brand royalties for Pure Franchise Restaurants (representing the
net amount collected after BK Europe’s royalties); and brand royalties and lease and business asset fees for
Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants (representing the net amount collected after BK Europe’s
royalties plus the net amount collected in lease and business asset fees after payments to landlords).

(d) Represents the restaurant operating EBITDA of former Quick restaurants that were either converted into Burger King

restaurants, definitively closed or disposed as of August 31, 2021, and which generated an EBITDA during the twelvemonth period ended August 31, 2021.

(e) Represents the restaurant operating EBITDA of any restaurants that changed their operating model during the Run
rate Period, and then estimate their restaurant EBITDA as if they had their new operating model during a twelve-month
period. The new EBITDA restaurant estimations are calculated on the basis of the assumptions underlying the EBITDA
estimations for each operating model described under the third step above. Based on the changes to their operating
models during the period, we applied these calculations to three Burger King Company Restaurants which transferred
into a Franchise Restaurant under Lease Management.

(f) Represents, in order to account for contractual changes in lease management rates for our Franchise Restaurants (i.e.,

as a result of progressive rates applied according to the year of openings), the amount of franchise revenues generated
by the lease management rate of these franchise restaurants with changed lease management rates during the twelve
months ended August 31, 2021, and then apply the lease management rates under the current franchise agreements
as of August 31, 2021

Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection, estimate or guarantee of performance regarding Adjusted
EBITDA generation for the year ending December 31, 2021 or any other future period which may be affected by definitive
closures of Quick restaurants, the phasing out of the novelty effect and the pace of conversions (including the length of
temporary closures required for conversion). Moreover, prospective investors should note that the increase in Adjusted
EBITDA modeled by Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for new restaurant openings and conversions may be offset, to a degree
that will vary on the circumstances, by a number of factors, including but not limited to the performance of the remaining
Quick network.

Investors should note that EBITDA is not uniformly or legally defined and is not a recognized indicator under IFRS. Other
companies in the QSHR category may calculate EBITDA differently, make different adjustments or employ other run-rate
estimations, and consequently our presentation of these figures may not be readily comparable to other companies’ figures
and must be read in conjunction with the discussion of gross margin, operating profit and operating cash flows included
elsewhere herein and in our consolidated financial statements. The adjusted run-rate information presented herein is for
informational purposes only. This information does not necessarily represent the results we would have achieved had all
such newly-opened or converted restaurants been in operation for twelve months ended August 31, 2021. This information
is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and it may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition
or results of operations, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed upon it when evaluating an investment
decision. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Presentation of_ _Financial and Other Information—The preparation of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as_
_presented in this Offering Memorandum includes certain estimates and assumptions which we consider reasonable, but we_
_cannot assure you that we would have achieved such levels of profitability for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021_

(2) “As adjusted net debt” is defined as the combined total short-term and long-term debt of the Issuers and their subsidiaries

following the Refinancing, including bank overdrafts, net of as adjusted cash, assuming the Refinancing had occurred on
June 30, 2021. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization”.

(3) “As adjusted financial expense” is defined as the financial expense on the Notes and other applicable financial

indebtedness of the Issuers and their subsidiaries for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, as if the Offering had occurred

(1) ARS refers to the annualized monthly average sales (excluding VAT) recorded per restaurant for the given sample size

calculated by (i) adding all monthly sales generated for the restaurant sample, but excluding (a) the month in which the
opening of any restaurant occurred (as applicable) or (b) the month in which any restaurant has closed for more than seven
days; (ii) dividing by the number of restaurant months to attain the ARS per month; and (iii) multiplying the ARS per month
by 12 to annualize it. ARS is largely driven by footfall, which is in turn generated by a variety of factors, including but not
limited to, location of the restaurants, product attractiveness, brand equity, consumer preferences, societal trends, general
economic conditions, consumer sentiment, weather, opening hours, marketing, digital presence and promotional activity and
limited time offers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations”._

(2) To account for the impact of COVID-19 on our restaurant operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six

months ended June 30, 2021, we have excluded periods during which restaurants were closed. However, we have retained
in our sample restaurants that were only partially closed or had limited operations as a result of COVID-19 related
restrictions.

**RISK FACTORS**

An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should read and carefully
consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum
before making an investment in the Notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and this, in turn, could adversely affect
our ability to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and cause you to lose all or part of your
original investment.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of those risks
actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer.

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these
forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be,_**
**_adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics._**

The COVID-19 outbreak and spread of the virus globally has adversely affected global
macroeconomic conditions and spurred an economic downturn that has led to increased
unemployment, lack of real wage increases and static or falling benefits, which have, in turn, negatively
impacted consumer confidence and generally fostered more price conscious spending, including in
France.

COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our operations, including by requiring us to manage
the numbers of customers in our restaurants, reduce or temporarily close the operation of certain of our
restaurants following evolving guidelines or orders by the French government, invest in protective and
other safety equipment and increase our reliance on home delivery and Click & Collect purchase
options. We have also faced the risk of product delivery delays or shortages as suppliers adapted to
government-mandated restrictions. Further, as a result of the pandemic and government-imposed
lockdown restrictions, consumers’ expectations with regard to eating out, particularly with regard to
safety and convenience, have changed. For example, the pandemic significantly accelerated the trend
of consumer reliance on food delivery options. If consumers’ heavy reliance on delivery services
continues and if the trend towards a long-term increase in delivery services compared to pre-pandemic
levels is confirmed, even upon the easing of pandemic restrictions, we may continue to face in the
longer-term the inherent risks associated with delivery services. See “—Our business is affected by
_changes in consumer preferences and perceptions” for a description of the risks associated with a_
sustained level of increased delivery activity.

As from March 2020, as a response to COVID-19, we complied with government-mandated
shutdowns of restaurants, country-wide lockdowns and safety measures across all our operations in
France. As a result of the first lockdown in France, a large majority of our restaurants were shut down
from March 17, 2020 through the end of April 2020, after which we underwent, and are still undergoing,
a period of gradual and progressive reopening of all our restaurants. We currently only have three
remaining restaurants that have not yet reopened: two of which are located in airports, one of which is
located in a train station and one of which is located at La Cité des Sciences in Paris and is scheduled
to reopen in the short term. During the second lockdown, which was followed by a nationwide curfew,
we were able to keep most of our restaurants open, however we experienced reduced sales as a result
of the lockdown restrictions. In addition, the French government announced a range of measures to

38


-----

support businesses affected by COVID-19. However, due to the size of our Group, we are limited in the
government aid we can receive and, even when we are able to obtain such governmental aid, its impact
is usually limited.

To support our franchisees throughout the evolution of these restrictions, and in order to allow
our franchisees to resume their operations following the first lockdown of 2020, we agreed to implement
certain temporary royalty adjustments, which resulted in reduced revenues from our franchisees during
this period. Further, as lessors of the restaurant premises under our Company Restaurants and
Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases
with the landlords of such restaurants as their revenues decreased during this period. See “—We are
_subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount of space, including future increases in_
_occupancy costs” for a description of the potential long-term impacts of such exceptional lease_
renegotiations with our landlords.

Despite ongoing vaccination rollouts, COVID-19 outbreaks remain prevalent around the world
as new, more contagious strains of the virus emerge. Beginning at the end of July 2021, France has
mandated the health pass (pass sanitaire) system, whereby individuals seeking to access a number of
public locations, including as of August 9, 2021, restaurants, malls and long-distance public
transportation, must provide proof of vaccination status or present a negative COVID-19 test. The initial
enforcement of the health pass in August 2021 has had an initial negative impact on our sales which
has since decreased. We cannot predict whether such an impact will continue in the future and there
remains significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to
COVID-19. For example, following the COVID-19 outbreak, the restaurant industry has experienced
difficulty in recruiting and retaining employees. This challenging recruitment environment may be further
burdened in the short-term by the national requirement since August 30, 2021 for all employees working
in contact with the public, which includes our in-store employees, to provide their employers with a valid
health pass.

The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results of operations will depend on the ongoing
development of the virus, which is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Any future mandatory
shutdowns, reductions in operations or other restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot predict whether such
challenging economic conditions will have any long-term effects on consumer confidence, our prices
and input costs, demand for dining out experiences or volatility of raw material prices, nor can we predict
if the state of the global economy will deteriorate further or when it will improve at a consistent rate.
These factors may therefore continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Further, following the COVID-19 pandemic, most insurance companies have begun to
exclude pandemics from their insurance coverage of operating losses. To the extent we renew our
insurance coverage or face a subsequent pandemic, our insurance coverage of the negative impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic (or other pandemics) on our operating losses would no longer be subject to
coverage.

Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect general
economic conditions or our business, operations, financial condition or operating results, it may also
have the effect of heightening one or several other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. For
more details on how COVID-19 has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic”._

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business and financial results may be_**
**_adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive_**
**_pressures._**

The restaurant industry in France is highly competitive. We compete primarily with other
well-established international fast food restaurant chains and franchises (such as McDonald’s, our main

39


-----

competitor with a dominant market share), as well as other regional and local QSR restaurants on the
basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service, location and the nature and condition of the
restaurants in our network.

The restaurant industry has few barriers to entry for opening one or numerous points of sale
and therefore new competitors may emerge at any time. We may lose market share to well-established
companies such as McDonald’s. Other international and national QSR chains such as KFC and Subway
may also take market share as they expand in France, and new chains may enter the market. We also
compete with QSR restaurants that focus on sandwiches or offer alternative menus, such as Paul,
Brioche Dorée, Exki and Prêt à Manger as well as “fast casual” restaurants. Lastly, we also compete
with certain segments of the food industry, such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared
food counters in grocery stores as well as online food options from our competitors through ordering
services platforms such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. Our ability to compete depends on our
ability to expand our network and continue to modernize and refurbish certain of our existing
restaurants, develop and roll-out new products and product line extensions, effectively respond to
consumer preferences, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and franchisee network as
well as the impact of our competitors’ actions, and maintain our customer’s perception of the quality
and value of our products.

The Burger King brand, which returned to France in 2012, is a relatively new brand compared
to our main competitor, McDonald’s, which has been present in France since the 1970s and has a more
established market presence, with more than three times as many restaurants and substantially greater
financial resources than we do. See “—Our main competitor has a substantially larger network than we
_do, and therefore we may be at a disadvantage in competing with it”._

In addition to competing for customers, we also compete for franchisees, management
personnel and employees. Our competitors may be able to offer greater resources and benefits to their
franchisees (for example, in terms of lower franchise royalties, advertising programs, greater training
and more extensive franchise support), as well as better salaries, compensation and benefits to their
management personnel and employees, all of which may enable them to attract and retain franchisees,
management personnel and employees more effectively than we can. The market for suitable
restaurant locations is also highly competitive and QSR companies, restaurant chains and other retail
companies compete for prime real estate sites. As a result of their size advantage and/or their greater
financial resources, some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable
commercial lease terms than we can, and some landlords and developers may offer priority or grant
exclusivity to some of our competitors for desirable locations. As a result, we may not be able to obtain
leases for new restaurants or renew leases for existing restaurants on acceptable terms, if at all, which
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, to the extent that one of our existing or future competitors offers items that are
better priced or more appealing to consumer tastes, increases the number of restaurants it operates in
one of our key markets, rebrands its restaurant portfolio to better enhance the restaurant experience or
has more effective advertising and marketing programs than we do, our revenue and those of our
franchisees could be adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could
experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, the inability
to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our main competitor has a substantially larger network than we do, and therefore we may be at_**
**_a disadvantage in competing with it._**

Our main competitor, McDonald’s, through its French master franchisee, is a well-established
branded chain and has substantially greater financial resources, higher revenue and greater economies
of scale than we do. According to the NPD Group, McDonald’s had a market share of 69% in the QSHR
category of the QSR segment for the first quarter of 2021 based on the SWS of burgers. Its significantly
greater size may enable McDonald’s to negotiate lower prices than we can from our suppliers (for

40


-----

example, in respect of raw materials) or better absorb increases in its cost base (for example, due to
inflation of raw material prices and increases in labor, rental and other operating costs). McDonald’s
also has a denser network of restaurants in France than Burger King, with approximately 1,500
restaurants (as of June 2021) for McDonald’s, compared to 412 restaurants (as of June 2021) for Burger
King (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or
definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion). These competitive
advantages may enable it to react to changes in pricing more quickly and more effectively than we can.
McDonald’s can and does spend significantly more on advertising, marketing and other promotional
activities than we do, which may give it a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand
awareness among consumers. In addition, McDonald’s and other competitors may be able to deploy
greater resources in order to accelerate restaurant openings and refurbishment efforts, to rapidly
expand their offer of new products or to implement aggressive product discounting, all of which could
give them a competitive advantage over us and could therefore adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Under challenging economic conditions, the competitive advantages resulting from greater
financial resources and economies of scale may intensify, thereby permitting McDonald’s or other
competitors to gain market share. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could
experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins and
revenue from Company Restaurants and royalty payments from Franchise Restaurants, the inability to
take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, all of which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business depends on the health of the French economy as the sole country in which we_**
**_operate._**

Our revenue and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending, which
is influenced by general economic conditions, unemployment levels, the availability of discretionary
income and consumer confidence, particularly in the communities where our restaurants are located.
Because our restaurants are exclusively located in France, any deterioration in the French economy
could have a significant effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial condition.
According to INSEE, French GDP grew at only 1.9% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019, followed by a significant
drop of 7.9% in 2020, which is mainly attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While French
GDP slightly rose in the first quarter of 2021 by 0.4%, a rebound to pre-pandemic levels may take longer
than anticipated as the health crisis evolves, which could translate in a slow recovery of consumer
confidence and therefore in lower consumption levels. Significant events such as sustained impact to
the French economy as a result of the ongoing health crisis and political uncertainty tied to upcoming
elections in France and other EU member states, could result in the implementation of strong
protectionist measures and may affect the recovery of the Eurozone, including the French economy or
lead to additional exits from the EU or the Eurozone. Furthermore, potential EU instability may have
important consequences on our ability to obtain supplies from other EU countries at reasonable costs.
A sustained economic downturn could cause our suppliers difficulty in accessing financing, which could
lead to insolvency or general decline in the financial condition of our suppliers resulting in disruptions
in our supplies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by_**
**_unforeseen events, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or catastrophic_**
**_events._**

Unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, public health crises, such as pandemics and
epidemics, natural disasters, sustained episodes of inclement weather or other catastrophic events can
adversely impact our and our franchisees’ restaurant sales and may discourage our customers from
dining out, thereby reducing footfall to our and our franchisees’ restaurants. For example, both Burger
King’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were adversely affected by the
terrorist attacks in Paris. Such events, even when outside of France, could dampen consumer spending

41


-----

among French consumers, reduce footfall and prevent us from operating our restaurants at peak
capacity or cause disruptions to our supplies. Because a significant portion of our restaurants operating
costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of revenue following such events harms our operating
margins and can result in restaurant operating losses.

In addition, other developments, such as strikes, boycotts, traffic blockades, both nationally and
in areas in which our restaurants operate, social and economic instability, civil disturbances,
government-imposed lockdowns, or similar events, could adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. For example, our operations in France were most impacted by the
Yellow Vests (Gilet Jaune) protests, which caused intermittent traffic blockades and transportation
disruptions, particularly in downtown areas, limiting foot traffic and access to our restaurants, during the
period from roughly November 2018 through early 2019. Any similar events in the future could have a
material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We hold a master franchise for the Burger King trademarks and trade names in France and are_**
**_therefore highly dependent on our franchisor._**

In 2013, we entered into the twenty-year Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe, the
duration of which has since been amended in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to extend for an
additional year through December 31, 2034, pursuant to which we have the exclusive right to use certain
trademarks and trade names associated with Burger King in France, open and operate Burger King
Company Restaurants and select and offer sub-franchisees the right to operate such restaurants. We
do not own the Burger King brand, and we are therefore highly dependent on our franchisor, BK Europe
and its ultimate parent, Burger King Corporation (“BKC”). Moreover, the Master Franchise Agreement
contains certain customary undertakings, and failure to reach certain restaurant opening milestones
may result in fines or early termination in certain circumstances (e.g., failure to reach pre-determined
new restaurant opening targets or to pay royalties when due). If the Master Franchise Agreement were
terminated, all rights granted to Burger King France under the Master Franchise Agreement (including
the development rights) shall terminate, and BK Europe and/or its designee may develop, open and
operate, and approve third parties to develop, open and operate, Burger King restaurants in France. As
a consequence, we would not be able to continue to expand our network and realize our anticipated
economies of scale as a master franchisee in France, although our rights and obligations under the
then existing company franchise agreements shall remain unaffected solely by reason of such
termination, and that any then existing franchise agreements (whether pure franchise or with
management lease) shall remain in full force and effect and we shall be able to continue receiving
payments thereunder until their respective terms. The early termination of the Master Franchise
Agreement with BK Europe could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We cannot control or influence the actions of our master franchisor, and our master franchisor
may take actions that could harm us. For example, BK Europe may at any time have economic,
business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Certain actions taken by BK Europe,
including those involving the Burger King brand, may adversely affect our business operations such as
BKC requiring its franchisees to adopt a product offering that we do not believe would be popular with
consumers in France. Moreover, if BK Europe does not adequately protect the Burger King brand and
other intellectual property rights, our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.

Additionally, pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe, we are required to
comply with operational programs established by our master franchisor. For example, the Master
Franchise Agreement requires that our restaurants comply with specified design criteria. In addition,
our master franchisor generally has the right to require us to remodel our restaurants to conform to the
then-current image of Burger King, which may require the expenditure of considerable funds. Failure to
conform to these requirements could constitute a breach of the Master Franchise Agreement, which
could adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.

See “Business—Our Business—Restaurant operations—Franchise Restaurants”.

**_Our success is directly related to the success of the Burger King brand worldwide._**

As a master franchisee, our success is, to a large extent, directly related to the success of the
Burger King brand, including the financial condition, advertising programs, new product development,
overall quality of operations of the BKC group and the successful and consistent operation of Burger
King restaurants by other franchisees in other countries, over which we have no control. We cannot
assure you that the Burger King brand will be able to compete effectively with other well-established
international QSR chains. As a result, any impairment of the brand or adverse publicity anywhere in the
world could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Food safety, food-traceability, food-borne illness and hygiene-related concerns, including_**
**_failure by third-parties and us to supply or handle food products in compliance with food safety_**
**_regulations or our requirements, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Food safety, food-traceability (including in respect of product origins, freshness and conditions
of preservation through the supply chain) and hygiene are top priorities, and we dedicate substantial
resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products in a clean environment.
However, food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow
disease”, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry
in the past, and could occur in the future. New illnesses resistant to existing precautions or diseases
with long incubation periods may develop in the future, such as mad cow disease, which could give rise
to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Risks to the health of our customers can arise from our
supply and logistics chain, which we do not control, and at our Company Restaurant and Franchise
Restaurant locations. We rely on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing
partners to supply ingredients used in the preparation of the meals we sell, including sauces, meat and
fresh produce. Although such third parties are subject to regulations, including food safety and
environmental regulations, such regulations may not prevent such third parties from experiencing
problems related to food safety and hygiene. As a result, our reliance on third party food suppliers,
distributors, logistics and warehousing partners increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could
be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a
single restaurant. In addition, although we maintain operational controls and provide employee and
franchisee training at our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants aimed at preventing
food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues, we can provide no assurance that
these measures will be sufficient.

Any report or publicity linking us, one of our franchisees or Burger King restaurants in other
countries to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or
contamination, could adversely affect the Burger King brand, along with our revenue and profits.
Outbreaks of disease, including influenza, or the continued emergence of COVID-19 variants, could
reduce footfall in our restaurants. If customers were to become ill from food-borne or hygiene-related
illnesses, we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants and, more significantly, the
Burger King brand and reputation could be damaged, which could result in a decline in sales, thereby
negatively affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, failure by
any of our third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to comply with
regulations, allegations of compliance failure, claims of intentional or negligent contamination of
ingredients and raw materials or prolonged and intense negative publicity may disrupt their operations
and result in a disruption of our food supply. Disruption of our third party food suppliers, distributors,
logistics and warehousing partners’ operations could in turn reduce or impair our supply of ingredients
or other raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food
contamination occurring at restaurants of competitors could also adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry
generally.

43


-----

The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the
price and availability of ingredients, which could result in supply chain disruptions, significantly
increasing our costs and/or lowering margins for us and our franchisees. In addition, our industry has
long been subject to the threat of food tampering by suppliers, employees or guests, such as the
addition of foreign objects in the food that we sell. Reports of alleged injuries caused by food tampering
have in the past severely injured the reputations of restaurant chains in the QSR segment and could
negatively affect us in the future as well.

In addition, the QSR industry is currently under heightened journalistic, legislative and
regulatory scrutiny stemming from the perception that some QSR products have contributed to
widespread medical problems, such as obesity and diabetes. Compliance with consumer health laws
and regulations, such as those regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items, may
be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if such laws and regulations change significantly, we may
be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs
associated with the implementation of those changes. We cannot make any assurances regarding our
ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully
implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu accordingly. The
imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial conditions, as well as on the QSR industry in general.

**_Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our_**
**_environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose_**
**_us to new or additional risks._**

Companies across all industries are facing increased scrutiny from stakeholders related to their
ESG practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other
influential investors, lenders and other market participants are also increasingly focused on ESG
practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of
their investments and consumer choices. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus related
to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital
or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies
which do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which
are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for
ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational
damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially
and adversely affected.

We have adopted certain practices and policies to align our ESG approach with our strategy in
order to deliver long-term social, environmental and economic values across our business. See
“Business—ESG & Sustainability”. However, our stakeholders may look to us to implement more or
different ESG procedures, standards or goals in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested
in us, or before they make further investments in us. We may also face increasing pressures from
investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to
prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. We are
also subject to evolving environmental regulations, the implementation of which may be costly and timeconsuming. See “—We are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations, which could result
_in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation”. As a result, we may_
be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and future
investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us. Additionally, we may
face reputational challenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards
set by certain constituencies or such constituencies might not be satisfied with our efforts or the speed
of adoption of ESG practices or polices. If we do not meet our stakeholders’ expectations or we are not
effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant
sustainability goals, trust in our brand may suffer and our business and/or our ability to access capital
could be harmed.

These limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as
our plans for growth may include accessing such capital markets. If those markets are unavailable, or
if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be
unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and may also impair our ability to service our indebtedness.
Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report
and comply with wide-ranging ESG requirements. Concurrently with the Offering, on the Issue Date we
plan to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will be a sustainability-linked
financing. As a result, we will be required to maintain our sustainability targets in order to benefit from
the pricing benefit associated with the sustainability-linked feature of the facility. Any failure to adhere
to such targets could result in the payment of maximum amounts set forth under the terms of the
financing. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility”. The
occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our results of operations depend on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising_**
**_programs which in turn require the support of our franchisees for their success._**

The success of our Company Restaurants and our Franchise Restaurants is heavily influenced
by innovative brand marketing and advertising, and depends upon the effectiveness of the advertising
programs and promotions that we implement. Burger King France’s marketing and advertising programs
must be approved by BKC, the owner of the Burger King brand. If BKC does not approve our marketing
and advertising programs, we may have to develop replacement programs, which could involve
additional significant costs and delay the implementation of our marketing and advertising programs.

Moreover, if our marketing and advertising programs are not successful, if our competitors
increase spending on advertising and promotion or if our marketing and advertising programs happen
to coincide with a larger marketing and advertising program from one or more of our competitors thereby
rendering our advertising program less visible or effective, we may not be able to attract new customers
and retain existing customers and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

Our Franchise Restaurants and Company Restaurants contribute to our advertising fund based
on a percentage of their gross sales. As a result, our advertising fund expenditures depend on sales
volumes at system-wide restaurants. If System-wide sales decline, there will be a reduced amount
available for our marketing and advertising programs. However, because of the significant financial
resources of our main competitors which have larger marketing and advertising budgets than we do,
we may have to maintain a certain level of marketing and advertising expenditure (notwithstanding any
decline in sales) in order to compete and maintain our exposure in the market. In such circumstances,
our margins may be diminished, which will have a negative effect on our results of operations. In
addition, our margins may also be affected if the cost of mounting advertising campaigns increases. If
our marketing and advertising programs are unsuccessful or are subject to an increase in cost, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_Our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception_**
**_of the Burger King brand._**

Our success depends in large part upon our ability and our franchisees’ ability to maintain and
enhance the value of the Burger King brand in the eyes of our customers. Brand value is partly based
on consumer perceptions of a variety of subjective qualities, some of which we may have limited or no
control over. Isolated or repeated events that originate from us, our franchisees or suppliers, can
significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable
publicity or result in litigation. For example, the Burger King brand could be damaged by claims or
perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers and distributors,
regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. Similarly, entities in our supply chain may
engage in conduct, including alleged human rights abuses, that damages the Burger King brand or its

45


-----

reputation. Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in, or negatively affect
the perception of, the Burger King brand and/or our products and decrease the value of our brands as
well as consumer demand for our products, which could result in lower revenue and profits. Additionally,
our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or
misconduct by a company officer or representative.

**_Our inability to control our franchisees may limit our ability to implement our strategic initiatives_**
**_and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

As of June 30, 2021, approximately 83% of our Burger King restaurants were Franchise
Restaurants under our Burger King brand (compared to 75% as of December 31, 2018) and
approximately 17% of our Burger King restaurants were Company Restaurants (compared to 25% as
of December 31, 2018). As such, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from Franchise
Restaurants. Revenue from Franchise Restaurants consists of brand royalties and rent under Franchise
with Lease Management agreements, each calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales.
Consequently, our results of operations depend substantially upon our franchisees’ sales volumes. Our
franchisees are independent operators and, while we can mandate certain operational standards and
procedures through the enforcement of our franchise agreements, we may not be able to quickly
respond to franchisees that do not uphold these standards. In addition, we cannot prevent our
franchisees from incurring indebtedness or conducting other businesses that could adversely affect
their financial viability, nor can we control many other factors that impact the profitability of our Franchise
Restaurants. Furthermore, franchisees may be less directly interested in preserving or enhancing the
Burger King brand and reputation than we are. Franchisees may operate their restaurants in a manner
inconsistent with our standards and requirements, such as the cleanliness, service or quality standards
set forth in our franchise agreements and manuals, or standards set by governmental laws and
regulations. In addition, franchisees may fail to adequately hire and train qualified managers and other
restaurant personnel. While we ultimately can terminate franchisees that do not comply with the terms
and conditions of our franchise agreements, our brand and reputation may nonetheless suffer and our
franchise business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The support of our franchisees is important for the success of our promotional activities and the
strategic initiatives that we seek to undertake, and the successful execution of these initiatives will
depend on our ability to maintain alignment with our franchisees. While we can generally mandate
certain strategic initiatives through enforcement of our franchise agreements, we need the active
support, as well as the managerial competence and, in certain cases, the financial ability, of our
franchisees if the implementation of these initiatives is to be successful. In addition, our efforts to secure
alignment with franchisees may result in a delay in the implementation of our promotional activities and
other key initiatives if we are not able to quickly obtain franchisee commitment and support. If a
significant number of our franchisees are unwilling or unable to participate in the implementation of
strategies that we believe are necessary to promote further growth, our business, results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_Our franchisees may not be willing or able to renew their franchise agreements with us._**

We enter into two types of agreements with our franchisees: traditional franchise agreements
(“Pure Franchise”) and franchise with lease management agreements (“Franchise with Lease
**Management”). See “Business—Our Business—Restaurant operations—Franchise Restaurants—**
_Types of franchise arrangements”. These agreements have a typical duration of nine years (renewable_
under certain conditions) for Franchise with Lease Management and ten years (renewable under certain
conditions) for Pure Franchise. Our franchisees who have entered into such agreements to operate one
or several Burger King restaurants may be unwilling or unable to renew their franchise agreements with
us for a number of reasons, including low sales volumes, high rental costs, lack of profitability or a
desire to retire. If our franchisees cannot, or decide not to, renew their franchise agreements with us,
we will have to find a replacement franchisee to operate their restaurants or otherwise operate them as
Company Restaurants. If a substantial number of franchises are not renewed, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Further, the European Commission is currently contemplating amendments to its Regulation
(EU) 330/2010, Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, (the "VBER") which provides parameters for
businesses entering into vertical agreements and published for public consultation a draft VBER and
draft revised guidelines on vertical restraints (the “Vertical Guidelines”) on July 9, 2021. The proposed
amendments, provide that an exemption of Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union shall apply to vertical agreements, in the event competing supplier and buyer have an
aggregated market share, which does not exceed 10% in the relevant market at retail level. In the event
competing supplier and buyer have an aggregated market share exceeding 10% (and not above 30%),
the exemption shall also apply, except for exchange of information between the parties. Such
amendments, if adopted, would necessarily concern franchisors. Indeed, whilst engaging in dual
distribution is not prohibited, specific attention should be given to the way a “supplier” who has set up
a dual distribution system operates, in particular regarding the exchange of information with distribution
partners. To address these concerns, the European Commission already proposed to make some
adjustments to the existing safe harbor for dual distribution.

Following the publication of the draft VBER and draft Vertical Guidelines, most of the parties
expressed the view that “franchising” should be more precisely defined at the EU level and in the context
of the VBER, so as to mitigate the possible effects of the contemplated amendments on informationsharing in the franchise system. The timeline for the final adoption of the revised VBER and Vertical
Guidelines is now expected on June 1, 2022. In the event the amendments would pass as proposed,
without further clarification, we will need to potentially modify our sharing of certain sensitive information
across our network and, if necessary, pass the exemption test. Such amendments, if adopted, should
be taken into consideration for our franchise network, if the latter qualifies as a dual distribution system
where a “supplier” not only sells its goods or services through independent distributors (such as
retailers) but also directly to end customers in direct competition with its independent distributors. In the
event the market share threshold is met, adequate measures, such as Chinese walls, would need to be
implemented in franchise networks, including ours, to frame the exchange of competitively sensitive
information (such as prices, customers or sales volumes) with distribution partners, which are
competitors on the retail level.

If adopted, such amendments could create an area of legal uncertainty and require burdensome
internal procedures that could be detrimental to the development of franchised brands. Such difficulties
could have the impact of dissuading us or our franchisees from using our existing distribution model,
which could negatively impact the size of our franchise network, and as a result, our business, results
of operations and financial condition

**_We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount of space, including future_**
**_increases in occupancy costs._**

We currently lease the premises for all our Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease
Management Restaurants. Leases are generally for a fixed term between nine and twelve years and
feature periodic increases based on indexation clauses. In addition, market practice for leasing
commercial space in certain high value areas such as central Paris requires the payment of key money
to lessors and/or the former tenant.

Our ability to effectively renew our existing restaurant leases or obtain restaurant leases to open
new restaurants depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage,
lease economics, demographics and other factors. We may not be able to renew our existing restaurant
leases on favorable terms or at all, including, for example, when the landlord is able to establish
statutory grounds for non-renewal or if the leases do not have the benefit of statutory or contractual
rights of renewal. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to renegotiate
certain of our leases with our landlords. See “—Our business, financial condition and results of
_operations have been and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other_
_similar pandemics”. This renegotiation may have an impact on our future leasing transactions moving_
forward as landlords who operate in the retail space may impose higher rents or new and stringent
conditions that would prevent losses like those sustained as a result of pandemic-related lease

47


-----

renegotiations. We typically occupy our restaurants under operating leases with terms of nine to twelve
years. Any favorable rental rates that we are able to negotiate upon entering such leases in the years
when there are high vacancy rates are not guaranteed to continue, and this may force us to pay higher
rents once those leases expire or restaurants are closed in desirable locations. In addition, under
French law, the maximum increases in rent imposed by law do not apply to leases with a term in excess
of nine years.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, leasehold and occupancy costs represented
approximately 14% of our revenue; however, as we expand our restaurant base, our lease expenses
and our cash outlays for rent under the lease agreements will increase. Our substantial operating lease
obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:

    - requiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental
obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry
in which we compete; and

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing.

If an existing or future Company Restaurant or a Franchise with Lease Management Restaurant
is not profitable and we decide to close it prior to expiration of the relevant lease, we would still be liable
for the fulfillment of the obligations under the lease. In the event we decide to close any underperforming
restaurant, we would have to renegotiate the terms of the lease agreement with the landlord for the
remainder of the term of the lease and/or potentially assign or sub-lease the premises to a third-party.
For additional information regarding our real estate, see “Business—Real Estate”.

**_Increases in input costs, such as ingredients, packaging materials and fuel, or shortages or_**
**_interruptions in the availability of these supplies, could adversely affect our results of operation._**

The primary raw materials that we use are beef and chicken. Plastic and paper for packaging
materials are also significant components of our cost of sales. See “Business—Group Operations—
_Procurement and logistics—Raw materials supply”. The prices of many of our raw materials are affected_
by fluctuations in commodities markets, governmental agricultural policies, customs barriers, food
safety warnings, the operations of suppliers, political upheavals and unforeseen events, such as severe
weather conditions. We are required to source raw materials from BKC-approved suppliers. In the event
of a supply disruption, a rise in commodities prices or other adverse event that affects our sources our
food or logistics costs could materially increase. In addition, BKC may choose not to certify any
additional suppliers that we may find in order to diversify our raw material sourcing or to replace our
existing suppliers, or such certifications may take longer than anticipated to obtain. Furthermore, our
existing or future suppliers may not maintain their compliance with BKC’s standards in order to maintain
such certification. Certain of our restaurants may have difficulty locating suppliers that meet the
certification requirements. Any difficulty in locating an adequate number of such certified suppliers could
affect these restaurants’ market position which could adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition. In addition, we and our franchisees are dependent on third parties that can
make frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet our specifications. Any disruption in
such regular deliveries could materially impact our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has
resulted in a number of closed borders with countries outside of the European Union, where a minority
of our suppliers are located. Such customs barriers could have an adverse impact on our deliveries,
therefore negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to
pass through any increase in raw material costs to our customers depends upon competitive conditions
and pricing methods in France. If supplies of these materials become scarce or prices otherwise

48


-----

increase significantly and remain high for an extended period of time, there can be no assurance that
we would be able to pass on any or all of the effects of such price increases to our customers, which
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Increases in labor costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We are a labor intensive business, directly employing 2,695 full-time equivalent employees
(excluding Quick’s operations and excluding franchisees employees) as of June 30, 2021.
Consequently, our success depends in part on our ability to manage our labor costs and its impact on
our margins. In this respect, we have to continuously monitor the productivity levels of our employees
by measuring a variety of productivity indicators, such as number of tickets per working hour and sales
revenue per working hour. In addition, we seek to minimize the long-term trend toward higher wages
through increases in labor efficiencies; however, we may not be successful.

Furthermore, we must continue to attract, motivate and retain regional operational and
restaurant general managers with the qualifications to succeed in our industry and the motivation to
apply our core service philosophy. If we are unable to continue to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified
managers or to motivate our employees to sustain high service levels, our business and our growth
could be adversely affected. Our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain a
sufficient number of qualified employees to work in restaurants, as well as restaurant managers and
supervisors. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions are
in short supply. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced a number of additional
difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees, in particular due to prospective employees’ perception
of the restaurant industry as requiring long hours and difficult working conditions. The recruitment
process may be further burdened by the mandatory health pass requirement from August 30, 2021.
See “—Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be,
_adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics”. The inability to recruit and_
retain qualified individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high
employee turnover in existing restaurants, which could harm our business. Any increase in the minimum
wage or labor regulations or protracted renegotiations of the restaurant industry collective contract in
France could also increase our labor costs. Additional labor costs could adversely affect our and our
franchisees’ business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business is affected by changes in consumer preferences and perceptions._**

The restaurant industry is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. If we fail to
continue to offer and create appealing menu items, we may not be able to sustain or increase customer
traffic. Moreover, concerns have become increasingly widespread about the health risks associated
with the QSR segment. If prevailing health or dietary preferences and perceptions cause consumers to
avoid our products in favor of alternative food options or if we are unable to rapidly adapt our product
offering to meet the changing health or dietary preferences of consumers, our business could suffer. In
addition, negative publicity about our products could adversely harm our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

In recent years, numerous companies in the QSR segment have introduced products positioned
to capitalize on the growing consumer preference for food products that are, or are perceived to be,
healthy, nutritious and low in calories, sodium and fat content or that meet other nutritional criteria, such
as gluten-free, vegetarian or vegan. Our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and
respond to changing consumer preferences, tastes and eating and purchasing habits. In addition,
consumers have increasingly relied on food delivery services. This trend has been significantly
accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Our business, financial condition and results
_of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other_
_similar pandemics”. Sustained consumer reliance on food delivery services could have long-term effects_
on our operations. In France, the food delivery service industry is predominantly concentrated among
a few key players, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. A sustained increase in our consumers’

49


-----

preference for food delivery could make us reliant on the few main delivery aggregators. Further,
purchases made through third-party delivery aggregators require the payment of an additional fee to
such third-party aggregators, increasing our overall costs. In the long-term, we may need to raise our
prices to recoup the additional delivery fees, or alternatively reduce our margins. Any such eventuality
could reduce our sales or have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

If our competitors are more innovative than we are, if we fail to appropriately respond to
changes in consumer preferences and perceptions or if prevailing health or diet preferences cause
customers to avoid our restaurants in favor of foods that are perceived to be healthier, we may fail to
retain existing, or attract new, customers. Any failure to retain existing, or attract new, customers could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our future prospects depend on our ability to successfully implement our restaurant expansion_**
**_strategy, but we may not be able to attract new franchisees or successfully develop or open_**
**_restaurants._**

Our growth strategy is based on the expansion of our network of Burger King restaurants. As
part of this growth strategy, we will continue to seek franchisees to operate new Burger King restaurants
in France. We believe that our ability to recruit, train, retain and contract with qualified franchisees will
be increasingly important to our operations as we expand. However, there is no assurance that we will
be able to attract new franchisees and/or joint venture partners, which will affect our ability to implement
our growth strategy. In addition, while we apply stringent criteria when selecting new franchisees, such
as previous experience in the business and access to financial resources, there is no assurance that
the franchisee will be successful.

Developing and opening restaurants involve substantial risks, including the following:

    - the availability of and competition for suitable locations for potential development sites, the
negotiation of acceptable lease terms, and delays in obtaining construction permits and in
completion of construction;

    - the impact of local tax, zoning, land use and environmental rules and regulations on our
ability and the ability of our franchisees to develop restaurants, and the impact of any
material difficulties or failures that we and our franchisees experience in obtaining the
necessary licenses and approvals for new restaurants;

    - changes in governmental rules, regulations and interpretations;

    - the availability of financing, at acceptable rates and terms, to both franchisees and third
party landlords, for restaurant development;

    - employing and training qualified personnel;

    - securing acceptable suppliers;

    - developed properties not achieving desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened; and

    - general economic and business conditions.

50


-----

There is no assurance that we, whether through Company Restaurants or Franchise
Restaurants, will be able to successfully open new restaurants or that such restaurants will generate
strong sales or profits. New restaurants may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful
operating experience and, in such instances, we typically have to rely on the expertise and local
knowledge of our local partners. Such markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer
tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new
restaurants to be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets or to incur losses.

**_We may be unable to obtain suitable locations for new restaurants and the quality of the_**
**_locations of our current restaurants may decline._**

The success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations. As demographic and
economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible
declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas
surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenue in those locations. In addition,
drive-through restaurants require sites with specific characteristics and there are a limited number of
suitable sites available in our geographic market. Desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for
the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a
particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation and we may face competition from other
restaurant chains for the same or nearby locations. Furthermore, we may relocate or open restaurants
in new areas in anticipation of future development which ultimately does not materialize. The occurrence
of one or more of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_We face risks of litigation and negative publicity from customers, suppliers and employees._**

We face the risk of lawsuits and negative publicity resulting from customer complaints
concerning food safety, service, operations, illnesses and injuries, including injuries allegedly caused
by our products, toys and other promotional items available in our restaurants, as well as illnesses or
injuries resulting from the fact that we and our franchisees operate retail commercial establishments
that are open to the public. In addition to decreasing our revenue and profitability and diverting our
management resources, adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could harm our brand
reputation, hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business, any of which
could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Further, we may be subject to employee, customer and other claims in the future based on,
among other things, mismanagement, unfair or unequal treatment, discrimination, harassment,
violations of privacy and consumer credit laws, wrongful termination, and wage, rest break and meal
break issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We have been subject to these types
of claims in the past and if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant
increase in the number of these claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition could
be harmed.

We are focused on improving the overall restaurant experience for families with young children.
Our strategy includes appealing to target family customers, therefore we now open all new Company
Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants with a children’s playground. We have taken steps to mitigate
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing extra health and safety measures across our
restaurants, including enhanced cleaning and sanitization measures, for the protection of both our
customers and our employees. Although we devote significant attention and resources in ensuring that
our facilities meet all applicable health and safety standards, any injury or health issue experienced by
a customer in our facilities may result in litigation and negative publicity, and could adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

51


-----

**_We face risks of litigation from franchisees._**

From time to time, we face litigation from current or former franchisees in connection with the
execution, termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement or regarding the implementation of our
expansion strategy or for other reasons. We cannot exclude the possibility that an arbitrator or a judge,
as applicable, could decide such proceedings against us, that such a decision could require us to pay
significant damages, could lead to other similar litigation, could harm our reputation or that our business,
results of operations and financial condition could be harmed as a result. See “Business—Legal
_Proceedings”._

**_We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could harm the_**
**_value of the Burger King brand and hurt our business._**

We are the master franchisee for the Burger King brand in France, as well as a licensee of the
Quick brand for the few remaining Quick restaurants that we continue to operate. See “Business—Our
_Business—The Burger King Master Franchise Agreement”_ and “Business—Our Business—Quick
_Disposal”. We therefore hold the exclusive right to use and to grant the right to use the trademarks and_
trade names of Burger King in France, as well as a non-exclusive right to continue to operate the
remaining Quick restaurants under the Quick brand for a limited period pending their conversion to
Burger King restaurants. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability
to use Burger King’s existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and
further develop our products in our existing market.

However, the protection of Burger King’s intellectual property rights, including the iconic names
of its product offering, such as the WHOPPER[®] burger, is outside of our control. We depend on BKC to
adequately protect Burger King’s intellectual property rights. If BKC’s efforts are not adequate or if any
third party misappropriates or infringes on Burger King-related intellectual property rights, either in print
or on the Internet, the value of the Burger King brand may be harmed, which could adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We enter into franchise and license agreements with our franchisees to operate and manage
their own restaurants under the Burger King brand. While we encourage our franchisees to maintain
the integrity of the Burger King brand, these franchisees may take actions that could harm the value of
Burger King’s intellectual property rights or the reputation of the franchise.

Burger King’s trademarks and our trademarks are registered in France. However, we cannot
assure you that all of the steps we and BKC have taken to protect these intellectual property rights in
France will be adequate. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights
to the same extent as the laws of France.

**_We have recently completed the sale of Quick Restaurants S.A. and we may from time to time_**
**_pursue other disposals, each of which involve numerous risks that could have an adverse_**
**_impact on our business._**

We have in the past, including through the recent sale of Quick Restaurants S.A., and may in
the future strategically dispose of certain of our assets. See “Business—Our Business—Quick
_Disposal”. The success of such disposals depends on market interest for the assets sold and our ability_
to maintain optimal management of operations of such assets during the transition phase. Further, even
following a successful disposal, we face the risk of potential claims by purchasers of our assets pursuant
to liability guarantees typically provided during asset sales. There can be no assurance that planned
disposals will be completed on the expected timeframes or at all. Moreover, all or any of these initiatives
may fail to improve performance and, consequently, materially and adversely affect our business,
operating results, financial condition or prospects.

**_Information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of our network security_**
**_may interrupt our operations or cause customer personal data to be lost._**

We rely heavily on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations,
including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants. The robustness and efficiency of such systems
and network infrastructure are critical to our business because our revenue and franchisee royalty
calculations are based entirely on the accurate and timely recording of System-wide sales. However,
despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to
damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other
catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, denial of service attacks,
viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. If our technology systems were to
fail, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our
operations which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and_**
**_employees could result in substantial costs, expose us to litigation and damage our reputation._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we receive and maintain certain personal financial and
other information about our customers and employees, including through our customer loyalty program
through our mobile app. We also rely on third party service providers to process data collection and
customer payments made using bank cards and credit cards. The use and handling of this information
is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the sub-national, national
and international levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If we or any such third party service
providers fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if any such loss of personal customer
data were otherwise to occur or if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of
data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident or if our employees, franchisees or
vendors fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and as a result information about our
customers and employees is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately), we could be
subject to liabilities and penalties, reputational damage, litigation or government enforcement actions,
the incurrence of substantial costs and a loss of customer confidence, thereby adversely affecting our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) on the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement
of such data came into effect. The GDPR obligates EU-based companies or companies that process
personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a
large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the processing of personal data including
transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and confidentiality; (ii) the ability
of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to
identify a legal basis before the processing; and (iv) rights of data subjects, such as, among others,
transparency, right of access, right to rectification, or right to erasure.

In spite of our continued efforts to comply with the GDPR and similar regulations, we also face
the risk that customer data that we collect may be stolen or misappropriated. Our customers may be
discouraged from providing us with their data and our business could be negatively affected as a result.
Under such circumstances, our regulation, results of operations and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected. As a data controller, we could face legal actions in the absence of
compliance with GDPR. In addition, we could also face legal action in the absence of compliance of a
third party processing personal data on our behalf. Given that we and/or third parties, on our behalf,
process certain sensitive information, we are subject to specific processing conditions and have taken
steps to ensure compliance with these conditions.

The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to
review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new
products, technologies, or types of data. The GDPR provides for substantial fines for breaches of data
protection requirements, which can be up to 4.0% of the annual worldwide revenue of the preceding

53


-----

financial year or €20.0 million, particularly in the event of a breach of the conditions applicable to consent
and/or related to data subjects’ rights. A fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures
that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease any processing). The
GDPR, the national implementing legislation, i.e., the French data protection rules and French law in
general, also provide for a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection
requirements and additional private enforcement mechanisms. For instance, the French supervisory
authority may issue a public warning, as part of a control revealing infringements of the applicable data
protection regulation, and in parallel a public formal order to comply with the applicable regulation. The
failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant administrative fines and sanctions, as
well as civil and criminal liability in some cases.

**_Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity._**

Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving
Burger King, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Burger King or for the industry or market
segments in which we operate. Such media topics could include food-borne or hygiene-related
illnesses, issues with food traceability, contamination, unsanitary restaurant environment, issues
relating to quality of service or product quality, discriminatory behavior, injuries or good citizenship.
Media reports relating to any of these topics, even when not involving us, could reduce demand for our
products and could result in a decrease in customer footfall in our restaurants as consumers shift their
preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. In particular, with respect to social
media, consumers value readily available information concerning the industry and market segments in
which we operate, and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and
without regard to the accuracy of such information. The availability of information on social media
platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Information concerning or affecting us may
be posted on such platforms at any time, including accurate and adverse information that may harm
our business. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our brand or our products, or the production
methods of any of our suppliers, could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless
of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. Our social media presence amplifies consumer
engagement with our brand but comes with less control due to consumer comments and hashtags
compared to more traditional public relations and marketing methods, which could associate the brand
with content or views, which are not aligned with our values. The harm from the spread of such
inaccurate information may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.
Any failure to maintain favorable brand recognition could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, activist groups, including animal rights activists and groups acting on behalf of
franchisees, the workers employed by suppliers and others, have in the past, and may in the future,
use tactics to generate adverse publicity by alleging, for example, inhumane treatment of animals by
our suppliers, poor working conditions or unfair purchasing policies. These groups may be able to
coordinate their actions with other groups, threaten strikes or boycotts or enlist the support of
well-known persons or organizations in order to increase the pressure on us or our industry to achieve
their stated aims. In the future, these actions or the threat of these actions may force us to change our
business practices or pricing policies, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. A decrease in consumer patronage as a result of negative publicity
from social media could result in a decline in revenue at Company Restaurants and Franchise
Restaurants, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Certain restrictions on media advertising may limit our ability to advertise and promote our_**
**_products to our key target market._**

We are subject to legislation that restricts advertising and promotion affecting the QSR segment
specifically targeted towards children on certain channels and at certain times of the day when children
and young adults are likely to represent the largest portion of the audience. Families with children are
one of our key target markets and if we are unable to effectively advertise and promote our products as

54


-----

a result of these restrictions on our media advertising campaigns, our business, results of operations
and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_We are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations, which could result in increased_**
**_costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation._**

As a preparer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to health, safety and
environmental directives, laws and regulations, including regulations promulgated and enforced by
local, national, European and international authorities. See “Regulation”. These directives, laws and
regulations relate to the remediation of land and water supply and use, water discharges, air emissions,
waste management, noise pollution, the use of refrigerators and workplace and product health and
safety. We are also subject to stringent food preparation, health, quality and nutritional disclosure
regulations and standards, as well as permits and licenses for operating as a preparer of food products.
Health, safety and environmental legislation in France and elsewhere has tended to become broader
and stricter, and enforcement has tended to increase over time.

Any failure to comply with health, safety and environmental requirements may lead to fines and
other sanctions and even restaurant closures, as well as damage our reputation. If health, safety and
environmental laws and regulations in France or in the countries from where we source our ingredients
significantly evolve or are strengthened in the future, the extent and timing of investments required to
maintain compliance may differ from our internal planning and may limit the availability of funding for
other investments. In addition, if the costs of compliance with health, safety and environmental
directives, laws and regulations continue to increase and it is not possible for us to reflect these
additional costs in the price of our products, our profitability could be adversely affected.

In addition, compliance with current and future directives, laws and regulations regarding the
ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming and could
affect consumer eating habits. If consumer health regulations change significantly, we may be required
to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the
implementation of those changes. Therefore, we cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to
effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully implement
the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings accordingly. See
“Regulation—Food and Beverage Regulations—Food Labeling and Nutrition”.

As is the case for businesses of our size, we are subject to inquiries and investigations from
regulatory bodies in the ordinary course of our business. Authorities may take the view that we are not
compliant with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make
significant expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices
to comply with differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and
regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business. For a
further discussion of the material regulatory regimes with which we must comply, see “Regulation”.

**_Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be_**
**_filed._**

We currently maintain insurance we believe is customary for businesses of our size and type.
However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are
not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism or
pandemics. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying
our reserves for losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs,
which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

55


-----

In addition, it has become clear that insurance providers will not cover any damages or losses
that we may suffer as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Particularly, insurance policies will expressly
exclude pandemics from the insurance coverages in the future. This approach could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations should a new pandemic
emerge.

**_We depend on the services of key executives, and our business and growth strategy could be_**
**_materially harmed if we were to lose these executives and were unable to replace them with_**
**_executives of equal experience and capabilities._**

Our senior executives are particularly important to our success because they have been
instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, identifying, recruiting and training
key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities and arranging necessary financing. We have
employment agreements with all members of senior management; however, we cannot prevent our
executives from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of any of these individuals
could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement is found. We also believe that they
could not quickly be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities and their successors
may not be as effective. See “Management”.

**_We are subject to tax risks._**

We must structure our organization and operations appropriately while respecting the various
tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such laws and regulations are
generally very complex. Additionally, because tax laws may not provide clear-cut or definitive doctrines,
the tax regime applied to our operations and intragroup transactions or reorganizations is sometimes
based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations
will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities, which may adversely affect our financial condition
or results of operations. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws and regulations
may make it difficult to restructure our operations in an advantageous manner. More generally, any
failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate may result in
reassessments, interest on late payments, fines and penalties.

Furthermore, we may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax
savings resulting from discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and
liabilities or in respect of tax loss carry-forwards from our entities. The actual realization of these assets
in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future
results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French tax
code (Code général des impôts) (the “French Tax Code”), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards
that may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million
plus 50% of the portion of taxable profit exceeding €1.0 million. As the case may be, similar rules apply
to tax losses generated by French tax consolidated groups. Any reduction in our ability to use these
assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax reassessments, or lower than expected
results could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any
reduction in our ability to use these assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax
reassessments, or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Finally, the services we provide to our clients are subject to value added taxes, sales taxes or
other similar taxes. Tax rates may increase at any time, and any such increase could affect our business
and the demand for our services, and thereby reduce our operating profit, negatively affecting our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as
international tax laws. Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely
affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments.

In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are
subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base
erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the
Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris
on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing
structures.

Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member
States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”)
adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning
of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was
later amended on May 29, 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD **II”), which, inter**
_alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that_
its provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from January 1, 2020. The ATAD provides,
in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial
expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions).
Such new rules apply since January 1, 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by Article
34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance
**Law for 2019”). The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) (the “French**
**Finance Law for 2020”) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD II and thus**
repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Tax Code.
See “—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion
_of the interest incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for_
more details on this rule.

In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law,
the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which
aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions.
Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement, or a series of
arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of
obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely
taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances.

The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on
October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated
Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in
the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU
countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for
businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European
Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure),
which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. More recently, in a communication to the European
Parliament and the Council of May 18, 2021 and denominated “Business Taxation for the 21[st] Century”,
the European Commission has announced additional measures in the field of corporate taxation to take
into account the evolution of the context of the EU business taxation policy. In particular, the European
Commission announced that it will propose a new framework for income taxation for businesses in
Europe (“Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) that will replace the
pending proposals under the CCCTB. BEFIT will be a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU and will

57


-----

consist in consolidating the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base,
which will then be allocated to Member States using a formula and be taxed at national corporate
income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission
alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and will give rise to consultations with the
business sector and civil society groups. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced,
among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the
misuse of shell entities for tax purposes, (ii) adopt a recommendation on the domestic treatment of
losses and (iii) make a legislative proposal creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance
(“DEBRA”).

Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019, following
the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the
French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future.

Our tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case
law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some
cases from third parties (including legal counsel), and similarities to facts and circumstances described
in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax
context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty
relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including
tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to
time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our
application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable
income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are
made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have
an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion_**
**_of interest incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness._**

Under Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct
shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code
are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in
Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates
on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the
French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article
39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the
rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest
computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent
financial credit institutions in similar circumstances.

In addition, France has implemented the ATAD regarding in particular interest deductibility
limitations and the ATAD II regarding hybrid mismatches with third countries.

Pursuant to the ATAD, codified in particular under Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the
deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to
the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to
its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net
financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated
by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party
financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions.

Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial
statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are
able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the

58


-----

same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this
specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their
amount.

French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the
amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s equity,
the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount
up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the
average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly)
within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s equity
(assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of
all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial
expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA
or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made
available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax
Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing
date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the
company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these
amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall
debt-to-equity ratio of the group, as determined under accounting consolidation rules, to which it
belongs is higher than or equal to its own debt-to-equity ratio.

Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward
indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of
financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million
threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused
interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years,
but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this
measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities.

Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i)
the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such
companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to
French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y)
in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax
Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group.

The ATAD II, applicable as from January 1, 2020 (except for certain of its provisions which will
be applicable as from January 1, 2022) and codified under Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax
Code provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level
of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the
receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment,
operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred
to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated
enterprises”, except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the
relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions).
If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will
generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity
will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If
the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the
receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity.

In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse
hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member
State in which it is incorporated or established and the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated
enterprises” (i.e., entities holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its

59


-----

voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit) are established, qualify the entity as nontransparent. Where such a hybrid entity is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the
case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax at its own level or taxable pursuant to Article
8 of the French Tax Code at the level of its partners or shareholders, to the extent that it is not taxed in
another State.

The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our
indebtedness incurred in France and may thus increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service
our indebtedness.

**Risks Related to Our Presentation of Financial and Other Information**

**_This Offering Memorandum contains numerous alternative performance measures, which are_**
**_not prepared according to any recognized accounting standard, are not audited or reviewed and_**
**_may be compiled on a basis that is different to similarly titled measures reported by other_**
**_companies._**

This Offering Memorandum includes a number of alternative performance measures (“APMs”),
such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA, net debt,
capital expenditures, as adjusted net debt, as adjusted financial expense, ratio of as adjusted net debt
to Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and ratio of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA to as adjusted financial expense.
We also present average restaurant sales (“ARS”) and System-wide sales (“SWS”), neither of which
are not identified as accounting measures in the framework of IFRS and, therefore, may not be
comparable with those presented by other groups. With reference to the interpretation of these APMs:

    - APMs are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and are not audited;

    - these measures are calculated solely on the basis of the historical data of the SSN Issuer;

    - the APMs must not be considered as substitutes for the indicators provided for under IFRS;

    - APMs are not indicative of our future performance; and

    - since APMs are determined on a basis which is not regulated by IFRS, the criteria applied
for the relative determination of APMs, as well as the definition and calculation of APMs
presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be homogenous with the criteria adopted
by other groups and therefore, APMs presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be
comparable with similarly titled APMs presented by other groups.

Therefore, examination of the APMs by an investor without taking into account the above
mentioned critical issues could mislead such investor in the evaluation of our business, financial
condition and results of operations and lead to an incorrect, inappropriate or inadequate decision by
such investor. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

**_The preparation of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as presented in this Offering Memorandum_**
**_reflects certain estimates and assumptions which we consider reasonable, but we cannot_**
**_assure you that we would have achieved such levels of profitability for the twelve-months ended_**
**_August 31, 2021 had all of our Burger King restaurants in operation or under conversion as of_**

60


-----

**_August 31, 2021 been in operation during such period and Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not a_**
**_projection of future performance._**

We have prepared Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA on the basis of certain estimates and
assumptions to present an estimate of what our Adjusted EBITDA would have been, had all of our
Burger King restaurants that were opened or under conversion as of August 31, 2021 been in operation
for the twelve-months ended August 31, 2021.

Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection, estimate or guarantee of
performance regarding Adjusted EBITDA generation for the year ending December 31, 2021 which may
be affected by definitive closures of Quick restaurants, the phasing of the novelty effect and the pace
of conversions (including temporary closures for conversion). Moreover, prospective investors should
note that the additional Adjusted EBITDA modeled by Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for new restaurant
openings and conversions may be offset, to a degree that will vary on the circumstances, by a number
of factors.

Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is subject to significant business, economic, financial and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially. Such
estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to:

    - the impact of the novelty effect for new Burger King restaurants discussed under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Evolution of our network”_
and whether this has been sufficiently accounted for in our assumptions;

    - estimates and assumptions regarding demand by customers visiting our increased number
of restaurants; and

    - assumptions regarding the absence of increases in our fixed costs resulting from the
operation of additional Company Restaurants during such period.

Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and the underlying calculations have not been audited, reviewed or
verified by any independent accounting firm. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is included in this Offering
Memorandum because we believe that it provides a useful indication of what our Adjusted EBITDA for
the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 would have been under certain circumstances and
assumptions as described herein; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial
performance under IFRS, and you should not consider Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as an alternative to
net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our
results of operations or liquidity. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we have used to
calculate Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA are reasonable and are based either on historical experience and

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and_**
**_operate our business._**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the Notes we will continue to have, a substantial
amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. As of August 31, 2021,
on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing, our total outstanding principal amount of
financial indebtedness (excluding the PIK Issuer) would have been €1,135.4 million. As of the same
date, after giving effect to the Refinancing, we also would have had €80.0 million available for borrowing
under our New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”,
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the PIK Notes”.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for a holder of the Notes,
including:

    - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our
other debt and liabilities;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth
through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic or industry
conditions;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt
in relation to cash flow;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry;

    - restricting us from investing in strategic initiatives, growing our business and exploiting
certain business opportunities; and

    - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or
raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be
affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Many
of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other
obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to
obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that refinancings or asset dispositions could be
effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our
debt instruments.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness, including at the level of our subsidiaries, including_**
**_indebtedness which is structurally senior, which could increase our risk exposure from debt_**
**_and could decrease your share in any proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral._**

Subject to restrictions in the Indentures and restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, we may incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with our
already substantial indebtedness. We have the ability to borrow up to €80.0 million under our New
Revolving Credit Facility, which borrowings and indebtedness are secured by the SSN Collateral on a
_pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes. The terms of the Indentures permit us to incur_
additional indebtedness which may also be secured on a _pari passu basis with the Senior Secured_
Notes.

Our subsidiaries may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future,
further increasing the risks associated with our substantial leverage. If any of our subsidiaries incur
additional indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ahead of you in any proceeds
distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up
of such subsidiaries. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. Further, incremental debt
at the level of the SSN Issuer and its subsidiaries that has cash-pay interest will reduce the ability of
the operating subsidiaries of the PIK Issuer to upstream cash that could be used by the PIK Issuer to
pay cash interest payments on the PIK Notes from time to time and to pay principal at maturity. If we
incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we now face, as described above and elsewhere in
these “Risk Factors”, could intensify.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and_**
**_the Indentures, which could impair our ability to run our business or to finance our capital needs._**

Restrictive covenants under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indentures
may restrict our ability to operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants, including
as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indentures contain negative covenants
restricting, among other things, our ability to:

    - make certain loans or investments;

    - incur indebtedness or issue guarantees;

    - sell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets and subsidiary stock;

    - merge or consolidate with other companies;

    - transfer all or substantially all of our assets;

    - make a substantial change to the general nature of our business;

    - pay dividends and make other restricted payments;

    - create or incur liens;

63


-----

    - agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
distributions;

    - layer indebtedness; and

    - enter into refinancings with affiliates.

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a springing financial
maintenance covenant that is tested quarterly to the extent total cash drawings outstanding under the
New Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any Utilizations of the Facility by way of Letters of Credit (or
bank guarantees) and any Utilization of an Ancillary Facility other than, in each case, by way of cash
drawing) on the last day of the relevant financial quarter are equal to or greater than 40% of the total
commitment under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility”._

The restrictions contained in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indentures
could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or
take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could
adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, pursue our strategic initiatives, make investments,
restructure our organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these
covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing
economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we
could be in default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indentures.

If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that is not cured or waived,
the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments thereunder and cause all amounts
outstanding with respect to such indebtedness to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could
result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments, including the Notes. Any such actions could
force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we may not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes
in such an event. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”, “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes” and “Description of the PIK Notes”. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to_
meet our debt service obligations, or our obligations under other financing agreements, in which case
our creditors could declare all amounts owed to them due and payable, leading to liquidity constraints.

Our ability to make interest payments on the Notes and to meet our other debt service
obligations, including under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indentures, or to
refinance our debt, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which in turn depends
on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial,
competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient
cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a
portion of our debt, including the Notes, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures
or investments or sell material assets. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional
financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes. If we are also unable to satisfy our obligations on other financing
arrangements, we could be in default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Indentures and other relevant financing agreements which we may enter into in the future. In the event
of a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or certain other defaults under any other
agreement, the lenders under the respective facilities or financing instruments could take certain
actions, including terminating their commitments and declaring all amounts that we have borrowed
under our credit facilities and any other indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur in the future
to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Such a default, or a failure to make
interest payments on the Notes, could mean that borrowings under other debt instruments that contain
cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes and the New Revolving Credit
Facility, may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. If the debt under the New
Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we have entered
into or will subsequently enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay the

64


-----

Notes in full. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able
to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements”, “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the PIK Notes”._

**_We may be unable to complete the Post-Closing Merger within the anticipated time frame, if at_**
**_all._**

We intend to complete the Post-Closing Merger before the end of 2021. Our estimation of the
time frame required to complete the Post-Closing Merger is based upon market practice for such
mergers in France.

Upon the completion of the Post-Closing Merger, NewCo GB intends to merge with the SSN
Issuer, pursuant to which the SSN Issuer will be the surviving company and will acquire all of the rights
and assets, and will assume all of the obligations of NewCo GB. As a result of the Post-Closing Merger,
the SSN Issuer will become approximately 91% directly owned by the PIK Issuer.

However, we have no obligation to complete the Post-Closing Merger and our failure to do so
will not be an event of default under the Indentures.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_The Issuers and certain SSN Guarantors are holding companies dependent upon cash flows_**
**_from the operating companies of the Group to meet their obligations on the Notes or the SSN_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuers and certain SSN Guarantors are holding companies that conduct no business
operations of their own and have no significant assets other than the equity interests and/or the
intercompany receivables they hold in each of their direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Issuers and
such SSN Guarantors are dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries available to
them, by dividend, interest payments on intercompany loans or other distributions to meet its
obligations, including under the Notes or their respective SSN Guarantees. The amounts of such
payments, dividends and other distributions available to the Issuers and such SSN Guarantors will
depend on the profitability and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries as well as the ability of those
subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuers and such SSN
Guarantors, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make
distributions, make interest payments on, or otherwise advance upstream loans to the Issuers or such
SSN Guarantors to make payments in respect of its debt, including the Notes and the SSN Guarantees.
While the Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement limit the ability of the Issuers’
subsidiaries, as applicable, to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make
other intercompany payments to the Issuers, these limitations are subject to certain significant
qualifications and exceptions. There can be no assurance that the Issuers’ arrangements with their
subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing the Group’s existing and future
indebtedness and the Group’s results of operations and cash flow generally will provide the Issuers and
such SSN Guarantors with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes or
the SSN Guarantees. In the event that the Issuers do not receive distributions or other payments from
their subsidiaries, they may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes.

In light of the fact that the PIK Issuer has no operations or significant assets other than the
equity interests and/or the intercompany receivables it holds in each of its subsidiaries and is bound by
restrictions on its activities pursuant to the PIK Indenture (see “Description of the PIK Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Activities of the PIK Issuer”), the PIK Issuer will not provide any periodic or_
other financial information about itself except to the extent that material differences exist between the
results of operations or financial condition of the SSN Issuer and its subsidiaries (on the one hand) and
the PIK Issuer and its subsidiaries (on the other hand). See “Description of the PIK Notes—Provision
_of Information.”_

65


-----

**_The PIK Notes will be structurally subordinated to all debt and liabilities of the PIK Issuer’s_**
**_subsidiaries._**

The PIK Notes will not be guaranteed by any of the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries and the PIK Notes
will therefore be structurally subordinated to all debt and liabilities of the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries,
including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes, as well as liabilities owed to
trade creditors. Such debt and liabilities are significant.

The PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation,
contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on or pursuant to the PIK Notes or to make any funds
available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee
the payment of interest on, or principal of, the PIK Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary,
including trade creditors, and claims of any preferred stockholders of the subsidiary, will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity,
including claims against the PIK Issuer by holders of the PIK Notes. In the event of any foreclosure,
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of any of the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries, the holders of the PIK Notes will have no right to
proceed against such subsidiary’s assets and holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors
will generally be entitled to payment in full of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before
any direct or indirect shareholder will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As
such, the PIK Notes are structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) of the PIK
Issuer’s subsidiaries.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to all debt and liabilities of the SSN_**
**_Issuer's non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Certain of the SSN Issuer's subsidiaries will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. The SSN
Issuer's subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes
or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including
lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of
such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the SSN Issuer or any SSN
Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor
subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other
than as part of a solvent refinancing:

    - the creditors of the SSN Issuer (including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) and the
SSN Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

    - the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary
before the SSN Issuer or any SSN Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be
entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Senior Secured Notes and each SSN Guarantee will be structurally subordinated
to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the SSN Issuer and SSN Guarantors generated
94.1% of the Group’s EBITDA and, as of December 31, 2020, directly held 88.1% of the Group’s total
assets, in each case net of intercompany eliminations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the
non-SSN Guarantors generated 5.9% of the Group’ EBITDA and, as of December 31, 2020, directly
held 11.9% of the Group's consolidated total assets, in each case net of intercompany eliminations. Any
of the debt that our non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the SSN Indenture
will rank structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the SSN Guarantees.

66


-----

**_The Issuers may incur other indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes. In_**
**_addition, creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations will_**
**_be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the SSN Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in_**
**_priority to the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Notes will be secured by the Collateral. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Security” and “Description of the PIK Notes—Security”. The Indentures and the New Revolving Credit_
Facility will also permit the Collateral, as applicable, to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness
on a pari passu basis with the Notes in accordance with the terms thereof and, in the case of the SSN
Collateral, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. Furthermore, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
obligations will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the SSN Collateral pursuant to
an enforcement action taken with respect to such SSN Collateral. As a result, in the event of an
enforcement of the SSN Collateral, you may not be able to recover on such SSN Collateral if the then
outstanding claims under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our hedging obligations are
greater than the proceeds realized from such enforcement. As a result, holders of the Senior Secured
Notes may not be able to recover the full amount from an enforcement action of the SSN Collateral.

**_The PIK Issuer may pay interest on the PIK Notes in PIK Interest rather than cash._**

The PIK Issuer will be required to pay the first two interest payments on the PIK Notes entirely
in cash. The PIK Indenture will provide that interest payments made after the second interest payment
are payable (i) entirely in cash, (ii) by increasing the principal amount of the PIK Notes or issuing new
PIK Notes (such increase or issuance being referred to herein as “PIK Interest”) or (iii) a 25%/75%,
50%/50% or 75%/25% combination of cash interest and PIK Interest, as further described under
“Description of the PIK Notes—Terms of the PIK Notes.” As such, holders of the PIK Notes could
potentially receive no cash interest on the PIK Notes other than the first two interest payments and the
last interest payment. Any ability of the PIK Issuer to pay cash interest on the PIK Notes would depend
on the ability of the PIK Issuer’s direct and indirect subsidiaries to make cash payments to the PIK
Issuer. Each of the SSN Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility limits dividends or distributions
from the SSN Issuer to the PIK Issuer.

The New Revolving Credit Facility and the SSN Indenture allow the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries
to utilize amounts that would otherwise be available to pay dividends to the PIK Issuer for other
purposes, and such uses would reduce the amount of cash available to pay dividends to the PIK Issuer
in order to pay cash interest on the PIK Notes. The terms of the PIK Notes offered hereby will not restrict
the ability of the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries to use their restricted payment capacity for such alternative
purposes. See “Description of the PIK Notes—Certain Covenants.” As a result, there can be no
assurance that the PIK Issuer will (or will be able to) make payments on the PIK Notes in cash. The
payment of interest through an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding PIK Notes or the
issuance of additional Notes would increase the amount of the PIK Issuer’s indebtedness and would
increase the risks associated with the PIK Issuer’s level of indebtedness.

**_You may face interest rate risks by investing in the Senior Secured Notes, as certain of our_**
**_borrowings bear, and the Floating Rate Notes will bear, interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

Our borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes, which
will represent a substantial part of our indebtedness after the Issue Date, bears or will bear interest at
per annum rates equal to EURIBOR, in each case adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest
rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with
these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make
payments on the Notes. Although we currently intend to hedge the interest rates with respect to the
Floating Rate Notes, we may not be able to obtain such hedges, or replace such hedges, on terms that
are acceptable to us, and any such hedge may not be fully effective, which would expose us to interest
rate risk.

67


-----

**_The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure, among other obligations, the obligations of
the Issuers under the Notes are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes but are granted only in
favor of the Security Agent on behalf and/or for the benefit of (among others) the Trustee and the holders
of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents and the Indentures. The holders
of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in
respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the
provisions of the Indentures) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

Under French law the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim
secured by such security interest are required to be the same person and such security interest cannot
be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary
(fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under
Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from
time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of
the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the PIK Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring
the obligations of the Issuers and the SSN Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the
Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (the “Principal Obligations”).

Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on
parallel debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 _Belvédère) relating to bond_
documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the
filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt, there can
be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such
a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights
of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt claim. There is no certainty that the parallel debt
construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security
Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the parallel debt construction are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the
risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of
the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indentures that become
particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best
interests of the holders of the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass.
com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed
by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings
commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has
not ratified the Hague Convention of 1[st] July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition,
so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the SSN_
_Guarantees and the Collateral”._

**_The holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the SSN_**
**_Collateral._**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, one or more common security agents shall serve as
the Security Agent for the secured parties under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured
Notes and certain hedging obligations with regard to the SSN Collateral (as applicable). The
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act
to enforce the security interests in the SSN Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured
creditors in respect of the SSN Collateral only at the direction of the “instructing group”.

Subject to certain exceptions described below and in further detail in the section entitled
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” among other things, the
“majority pari passu creditors” (generally, creditors representing the simple majority of, among other
things, the outstanding principal amount under the Senior Secured Notes and any pari passu secured
indebtedness) shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the right to instruct the Security Agent
as to the enforcement of the SSN Collateral, provided that such instructions are consistent with the
“enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. If, however:

    - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method
of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a
financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, in each case, within three
months of the date on which an instructing group delivers a copy of their proposed
enforcement instructions (the “initial notice”); or

    - the “super senior discharge date” (as described in the section below entitled “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) has not occurred within six_
months of the date of the initial notice; or

    - an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a member of the Group; or

    - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method
of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a
financial adviser to assist them in making a determination, and the “majority super senior
creditors” (as described below): (a) determine in good faith that a delay in issuing
enforcement instructions could have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a
distressed disposal or on the expected realization proceeds of any enforcement; and
(b) deliver enforcement instructions they believe to be consistent with the enforcement
principles before the Security Agent has received instructions from the majority pari passu
creditors;

then the Security Agent shall, instead follow the instructions that are subsequently given by the “majority
super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing more than 66.67% of the aggregate of all
unpaid and undrawn commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the termination value
or assumed termination value of certain hedging liabilities), provided that such instructions are
consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes in a number of respects. Disputes may occur between the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes and creditors under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the
relevant hedging obligations or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate
manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the SSN Collateral securing
such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be bound by any
decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant
collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or may

69


-----

be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale
of any SSN Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other
indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections
intended to maximize the cash recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the New
Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations or the holders of any
permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of
the Senior Secured Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant security
documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes to do so.

In addition, other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence
enforcement actions against the SSN Issuer or its subsidiaries, the SSN Issuer or one or more of its
subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain SSN
Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional
indebtedness which may be secured by security interests in the SSN Collateral, the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes may not constitute the requisite majority of pari passu creditors for the purposes
of instructing the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

**_The holders of the Notes may be limited in their ability to take enforcement action in respect of_**
**_the Collateral._**

The Indentures will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the security documents relating to the Collateral on behalf of the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes
are and will be barred from taking enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes,
except through the Trustee under the respective Indentures, who will (subject to the provisions of such
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

**_Applicable laws may limit amounts recoverable under the SSN Guarantees and the security_**
**_interests in the SSN Collateral._**

The obligations of the SSN Guarantors and grantors of security interests in the SSN Collateral
will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or granted by such SSN Guarantor or
grantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction without rendering the relevant SSN Guarantee or
security interest in the SSN Collateral voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law.

In France, the enforcement of the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN
Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured over such SSN
Collateral, as applicable, under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting
of such a SSN Guarantee or security interest in the SSN Collateral is not in the grantor’s corporate
interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such
guarantee or security interest would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or
any other general statutory laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain
jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

In France, the liabilities and obligations under the SSN Guarantees and the security interests
in the SSN Collateral are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred,
would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French
_Code de Commerce or infringement of the provisions of Articles L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Code_
_de Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the_
offering of the Senior Secured Notes which the Issuers have applied for the direct benefit of each French
Guarantor through intercompany loans. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations
under the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral could be significantly less
than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or a French SSN Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under the SSN Guarantee and the security interest in the SSN Collateral.
French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the

guarantee must be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The
existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are
commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no
clear guidance. See "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral"._

**_Secured parties may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event they decide to enforce a pledge_**
**_over the shares of French subsidiaries by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral_**
**_consisting of shares rather than by a sale of such collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests in the Collateral governed by French law may only secure payment
obligations, may only be enforced following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured
amount which is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) in connection with a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a
public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial
attribution (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of non-judicial private attribution
(pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of private sale may not
be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from
such enforcement method.

If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of attribution (whether judicial attribution or
private attribution), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed
assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial attribution or by a
pre-contractually agreed or court appointed expert in the context of a private attribution. In any event, if
the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will
be required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the pledged assets
and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

Consequently, in the event that the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and the holders of the Notes are entitled to, and decide to, enforce the Collateral, as the case may be,
which consists of a pledge over the shares of each Issuer, through judicial or private foreclosure, and
the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the holders of the Notes may be
required to pay immediately to the relevant pledgors a “soulte” equal to the amount by which the value
of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt.

If the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such shares, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Alternatively, the holders of the Notes could decide to undertake the sale of the pledged shares
by public auction. As public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going
concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the
value of the group as a going concern.

**_The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the_**
**_obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Collateral. The SSN Collateral will also
secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain
hedging obligations. In addition, the PIK Indenture allows the incurrence of certain additional permitted
debt that is secured by the PIK Collateral, and the SSN Collateral may also secure additional debt to

71


-----

the extent permitted by the terms of the SSN Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the
Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any
increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral.

Not all of the respective Issuers’ assets will secure, directly or indirectly, the Notes. The value
of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend
upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, whether
or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the French economy and the availability
of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for
such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that there will be a market for the sale of the
Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In
addition, the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is
subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all of the obligations of the entity must first
be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal
perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indentures, the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, and accepted by other creditors that have
the benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or after the
date the Notes are first issued, as the case may be. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value
of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.
Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors,
including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or
characterization under the laws of France. The security interests will be subject to practical problems
generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Issuers cannot
assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Issuers also cannot
assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure
on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets,
and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

Furthermore, due consideration should be given by investors to the circumstance that
enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in France may be materially more
complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be
familiar.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_applicable Collateral will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the_**
**_Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the PIK Collateral will be released automatically, including:

    - upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the PIK Issuer under
the PIK Indenture and the PIK Notes;

    - in accordance with the caption entitled “Description of the PIK Notes—Amendments and
_Waivers”;_

    - as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption entitled
“Description of the PIK Notes—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of
_Assets”;_

72


-----

    - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the PIK
Indenture as provided below under the captions “Description of the PIK Notes—Legal
_Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of PIK Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and_
_Discharge”;_

    - in the case of a security enforcement sale in the release of the property and assets subject
to such enforcement sale;

    - solely with respect to the Account Pledge, as described under “Description of the PIK Notes
—Cash Interest Account”; and

    - with respect to any Liens over Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer, in connection with or in
contemplation or anticipation of an IPO Event (as defined in “Description of the PIK Notes”)
or an issuance or sale of Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer.

See “Description of the PIK Notes—Security—Release of the Security”.

Under various circumstances, the SSN Collateral will be released automatically, including:

    - in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of SSN Collateral to a person that
is not the SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

    - the release of SSN Collateral owned by or in respect of a SSN Guarantor that is released
from its SSN Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the SSN Indenture;

    - the release of SSN Collateral owned by a SSN Guarantor upon its designation by the SSN
Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes”);_

    - the release of a pledge over the shares of the SSN Issuer in connection with certain
qualifying initial public offerings of the shares of the SSN Issuer; or

    - the release of SSN Collateral in the case of a security enforcement sale in compliance with
the Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of the SSN Notes—Security—Release of the Security”.

Unless consented to by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (and subject to certain
exceptions), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement
scenario, exercise its rights to release the security interests in the SSN Collateral unless, among other
things, the relevant sale or disposal is made:

    - for consideration of which all or substantially all is in the form of cash; and

    - pursuant to a public auction, or if a fairness opinion has been obtained from an
internationally recognized investment bank, accountancy firm or other valuation
professional services firm selected by the Security Agent.

73


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the SSN Collateral may be released and retaken
in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes. Under
certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could
challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of the SSN Collateral. Any such challenge, if
successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of the SSN Collateral and thus reduce your
recovery under the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”._

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and
its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and the grantor of the
security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims
of the Notes if the Issuers, the relevant grantors or the Security Agent fail or are unable to take the
actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee
nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens.

Share pledges over the shares of the Issuers and certain SSN Guarantors consist of pledges
over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant shares are registered.
The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge
(déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the
Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s
account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of the Issuers and
such SSN Guarantors. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not
publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if
it is not publicly registered.

**_The Issuer may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control_**
**_offer._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuers will be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, there can be no assurance that the Issuers would
have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or, in
the case of the SSN Issuer, that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the SSN Issuer's other contractual obligations would allow the SSN Issuer
to make such required purchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or
acceleration of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that the Issuers
have incurred or may incur in the future. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could
cause a default under any indebtedness that the Issuers have incurred or may incur in the future
(including, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility), even if the
change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from their subsidiaries to
allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may
be limited by the Group's then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a
time when the Issuers’ subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuers for the purpose
of repurchasing the Notes, the Issuers’ subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such
indebtedness to fund the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain
such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuers will remain
prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, the Issuers expect that they would require
third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. There can be
no assurance that the Issuers would be able to obtain such financing. The Issuers’ failure to offer to
purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the respective Indentures, which could, in turn,
constitute a default under certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” and “Description of the PIK Notes—_
_Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control”._

74


-----

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring
or other similar refinancings involving the Issuer that may adversely affect you, because such corporate
events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not
constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indentures. Except as described under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” and_
“Description of the PIK Notes—Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control”, the Indentures will
not contain provisions that would require the Issuers to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the
event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar refinancing.

The definition of “change of control” in the Indentures will include a disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of each Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a
whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
refinancing would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of each of the Issuer’s assets and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control
has occurred and whether the Issuers are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with yours as a creditor._**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the share capital of the PIK Issuer is indirectly
owned by BH, the parent company of the Groupe Bertrand entities controlled by Olivier Bertrand as
majority shareholder and Bridgepoint as a significant minority shareholder, in each case through various
entities. Further, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the share capital of the SSN Issuer is
principally indirectly owned by (i) Restaurant Brands International, Inc., the parent company of BK (UK)
Company Ltd. (approximately 8.5%), (ii) BH, the parent company of the Groupe Bertrand entities
controlled by Olivier Bertrand (54.6%) and (iii) Bridgepoint (36.3%). As a result, such shareholders
effectively have control over major decisions regardless of whether other stakeholders, including
noteholders, believe that any such decisions are in their own best interests. The interests of such
shareholders as equity holders may conflict with your interests as a noteholder. Such shareholders may
have an incentive to increase the value of their respective investments or cause the Issuers to distribute
funds at the expense of our financial condition and affect the Issuers’ ability to make payments on the
Notes. In addition, they may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, capital
expenditures or other refinancings that they believe could enhance their equity investments even though
such refinancings might involve risks to the holders of the Notes. Certain of these shareholders are in
the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests
in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with the Issuers and their subsidiaries.

**_The SSN Issuer maintains cash management arrangements with its indirect parent BH, and, as_**
**_a result, a significant amount of its free cash is held by BH._**

The SSN Issuer has entered into the BH Cash Management Agreement with BH, its indirect
principal shareholder whom it does not control. See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party
_Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Cash management agreement”. Under the BH Cash_
Management Agreement, the SSN Issuer advances to BH a portion of its cash on balance sheet to
facilitate the deposit of such cash with certain financial institutions on its behalf in order to optimize its
cash management and increase the return on its cash investments. BH can only invest this cash in
liquid and risk-free financial instruments. The SSN Issuer’s consolidated free cash is subject to this
arrangement. All funds the SSN Issuer advances to BH, and all securities purchased with such funds,
and proceeds of all of the foregoing, are deposited in segregated accounts in the name of BH, and
these accounts are pledged to the SSN Issuer to secure BH’s obligations under the BH Cash
Management Agreement. The SSN Issuer’s receivables under the Cash Management Agreement will
in turn be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured
Notes to secure the SSN Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the New Revolving
Credit Facility.

75


-----

Under the BH Cash Management Agreement, the SSN Issuer has the right at any time to
require BH to repay it any cash or other property held on its behalf by BH thereunder, subject to
reasonable notice. However, the SSN Issuer’s ability to enforce this right may be suspended in the
context of certain French insolvency proceedings involving BH. Moreover, even though the Security
Agent can, on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes, enforce the pledge of the
SSN Issuer’s receivables under the BH Cash Management Agreement, thereby giving it a direct claim
against BH on behalf of the holders of Senior Secured Notes, its ability to enforce this direct claim would
be similarly adversely affected under such circumstances. Therefore, if BH were to become subject to
insolvency proceedings, the SSN Issuer’s ability to access the cash and other property held by BH on
our behalf may be legally blocked, and the amount of such cash and other property may be significant.

Moreover, neither of the Issuers control BH, and, since BH is not in the restricted group under
the Indentures or the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, it is not subject to the covenants set
out therein. Therefore, the ability of the holders to monitor and assess any potential for insolvency at
the level of BH or to prevent it from taking actions that would violate the BH Cash Management
Agreement or be inconsistent with the interests of the holders is very limited.

See “—The insolvency laws of applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the
_insolvency laws of the jurisdiction with which you are familiar”._

**_The Senior Secured Notes will not be initially secured by all of the SSN Collateral and the SSN_**
**_Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Senior Secured Notes._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 120 days after the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will
not be secured by all of the SSN Collateral, as further described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Security”. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on the Issue Date, the Senior_
Secured Notes will be secured only by the Issue Date SSN Collateral. We will take such necessary
actions so that the Senior Secured Notes are secured by the Post-Closing SSN Collateral within 120
days after the Issue Date. There can, however, be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring
such security interests within the time period specified or at all.

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will not be guaranteed. The Senior Secured Notes
will be guaranteed by the SSN Guarantors within 120 days from the Issue Date, provided that (x) such
guarantees shall in each case be granted substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in
favor of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and subject to any requirements
therein (and for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be required to be granted any earlier than those
obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and (y) are in all cases subject to the
Agreed Security Principles. We will agree in the SSN Indenture to take such necessary actions so that
the SSN Guarantors become guarantors of the Senior Secured Notes by executing and delivering to
the Trustee supplemental indentures substantially in the form attached to the SSN Indenture. The SSN
Guarantees will be limited as set forth in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

**_The insolvency laws of applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency_**
**_laws of the jurisdiction with which you are familiar._**

On the Issue Date, the Issuers' obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and PIK Notes will
be secured by security interests in the Issue Date SSN Collateral and PIK Collateral, respectively. The
Issue Date SSN Collateral includes first-ranking pledges over the shares in the SSN Issuer and certain
of its subsidiaries, first-ranking pledges of certain bank accounts and intragroup loan receivables held
by the SSN Issuer. The PIK Collateral includes first-ranking pledges over the shares in the PIK Issuer
and the Cash Interest Account. Within 120 days of the Issue Date, the SSN Issuer's obligations under
the SSN Notes will be guaranteed by the SSN Guarantors and secured by security interests in the PostClosing SSN Collateral. The Post-Closing SSN Collateral includes, among other assets, first-ranking
pledges over the shares in certain of the SSN Guarantors' subsidiaries and first-ranking pledges of
certain bank accounts and intragroup loan receivables held by the SSN Guarantors. The insolvency,

76


-----

administration and other laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the
laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar.

Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and
limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the
enforceability of the Notes against the Issuers, the enforceability of a SSN Guarantee against a SSN
Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. Such courts may also in
certain circumstances void the security interest or the SSN Guarantee where the company is close to
or near insolvency.

In France, among other limitations, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral in
connection with the issuance of the Notes may fall under the legal framework of hardening periods
where certain arrangements or dispositions that are made during a specified period (the “suspect
**period”) preceding the opening order of reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings may be**
challenged by the receiver, the judicial administrator or the public prosecutor in bankruptcy and certain
creditors under the applicable rules of avoidance. Indeed, while opening reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings, a French Court will set the date on which the debtor is deemed to have become
insolvent (date de cessation des paiements). This date can be fixed at any time up to 18 months prior
to the judgement opening the proceedings. The period between the date of insolvency and the
commencement of insolvency proceedings is known as the suspect period. The Indentures also permit
the security interests in the Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. At each time,
if the security interest were granted or recreated during the hardening period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. For more
information see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral”. In France, insolvency legislation tends to_
favor the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors. In the
context of insolvency proceedings affecting creditors, including court-assisted pre-insolvency
proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)), and
court-controlled insolvency proceedings (safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard (sauvegarde
_accélérée) and reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement ou liquidation judiciaire)), the_
ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes could be limited or suspended.

For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the
SSN Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral”._

In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the SSN Guarantors or any other of the Issuers’
subsidiaries, or any other grantor of security interests in the Collateral, experiences financial difficulty,
it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions.
Rights under the Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency
and administrative laws of more than one jurisdiction and there can be no assurance that the holders
of the Notes will be able to effectively enforce their rights in complex proceedings. The application of
these laws may also conflict with each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other
creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability
to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your rights
under the SSN Guarantees and limit any amounts that you may realize from the Collateral.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

The Issuers cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

77


-----

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for
the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is
subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract
different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the
market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on
you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there
is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. In addition, the
Indentures allow the Issuers to issue further additional Notes in the future, as applicable, which could
adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_The Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes may be, and the PIK Notes will be, issued with_**
**_original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Because no portion of the stated interest on the PIK Notes is unconditionally
payable in cash at least annually, interest payments on the PIK Notes will not be treated as qualified
stated interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the PIK Notes will be treated as having been
issued with OID. There will be additional OID if and to the extent that the issue price of the PIK Notes
is less than their stated principal amount. A holder of Senior Secured Notes or PIK Notes that is subject
to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include any OID on such Notes in gross
income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, potentially in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to
such OID and regardless of such holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.

**_The Floating Rate Notes, drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility and any future_**
**_variable interest rate debt we incur in the future will bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

After giving effect to the offering of the Floating Rate Notes and the Refinancing, a large portion
of our debt, including the Floating Rate Notes, will continue to bear interest at a variable rate, and we
will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. The Floating Rate Notes will bear a variable
rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR"), plus an applicable margin, and the New
Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable rate based on the EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin.
These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated
with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to
make payments on the Floating Rate Notes. Neither the SSN Indenture nor the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a
portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay
a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest
rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing
cash flow.

The European Money Markets Institute (“EMMI”, the administrator of EURIBOR) announced in
2020 that measures needed to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform EURIBOR to ensure
continued publication and compliance with E.U. Benchmarks Regulation, such regulation having been
implemented into EU law in order to address perceived weaknesses in the admininstration of
benchmarks and entering into force on June 30, 2016 (subject to certain transitional provisions). EMMI
has subsequently confirmed that it is compliant with the E.U. Benchmarks Regulation. However, there
can be no guarantee that subsequent changes in regulatory guidance, industry standards or market

78


-----

practice could result in further changes to way in which EURIBOR, LIBOR or EURIBOR replacement
rates or mechanisms or other risk-free rates are drafted, implemented or interpreted. In addition, the
potential elimination of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any
benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner
in which EURIBOR or other benchmarks are determined, which could require an adjustment to the
terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark
(including but not limited to the Floating Rate Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility). Any such
change could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates
of interest.

Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements to fix a portion of these interest rates,
there can be no assurance that any such current or future hedging arrangements will adequately protect
our operating results from the effects of interest rate fluctuations or will not result in losses or that our
risk management practices and procedures will operate successfully.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes, which risk may be increased if_**
**_the euro no longer exists or if the Notes are otherwise redenominated as a result of member_**
**_states leaving the Eurozone._**

The Notes are denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns
by reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments
because of economic, political and other factors over which the Issuers have no control. Depreciation
of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments
could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could
result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to
which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in
a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. holders (as defined in ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations’’) may also have important tax consequences as a result of_
foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations’’. Despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate_
credit risk, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to
meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single
currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone member states.
These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more
member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should
the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated
obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. The Issuers cannot assure you that the
official exchange rate at which the Notes may be redenominated would accurately reflect their value in
euro. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these developments and related
issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuers and their subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and the Group’s
business is conducted entirely outside the United States. Most of the members of the board of directors,
supervisory board and all of the senior management of the Issuers and the Group are nonresidents of
the United States. Although the Issuers will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process
within the United States on its or its subsidiaries’ directors and executive officers. In addition, as the
assets of the Issuers and their subsidiaries and those of their respective directors and executive officers
are generally located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained
in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions
of the Issuers may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States.

-----

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with
France. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal
securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France. In addition, the enforcement in France
of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon
U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in
France would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action
brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal securities laws violations. For further information, see
“Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk
factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not
a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain
constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by
the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and
could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Many of the covenants contained in the Indentures will be suspended if the Notes are rated_**
**_investment grade._**

Many of the covenants in the Indentures governing the Notes will be suspended if the Notes
are rated BBB- or better by at least two rating agencies provided that at such time no default under the
Indentures has occurred and is continuing. These covenants will restrict, among other things, the
Issuers’ ability to pay dividends, to incur debt and to enter into certain other transactions. There can be
no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment
grade, that the Notes will maintain such ratings. Suspension of these covenants, however, would allow
the Issuers to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were
in force, including incurring additional debt, paying dividends and making investments which may
conflict with, or otherwise be adverse to, the interests of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of
_the PIK Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Certain Covenants when PIK Notes Rated_
_Investment Grade” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of_
_Certain Covenants when Senior Secured Notes Rated Investment Grade”._

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been and
will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, you may not
transfer or sell the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a refinancing
not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement, and you may be required to bear the risk of your
investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. The Indentures contain provisions that restrict
the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available
pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, or other exemptions under the
U.S. Securities Act. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on
its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall
not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than €100,000.

Furthermore, the Issuers have not registered the Notes under any other country’s securities
laws and do not have any intention to do so. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of
the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See
“Notice to Investors”.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered
form, or definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very
limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of
Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole
registered holder of the global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other
amounts owing on or in respect of the global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying
agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be
credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the
Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the paying agent for
onward payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuers will have no responsibility or liability for the
payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if
investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of
the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder
of Notes under the Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from
holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to
the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a
timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry
interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of
rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**_The Notes may not become, or may not remain, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuers intend to apply for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its Euro MTF Market and to maintain such
listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuers cannot assure you that the Notes will become
or remain listed. If the Issuers cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and the admission to trading on the Euro MTF Market or they determine that they will not
maintain such listing, the Issuers may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, provided that they will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized stock exchange, although there can be no
assurance that the Issuers will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of
the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another
recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indentures, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indentures may have a material adverse effect on a
holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The table below sets forth the expected estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with
the Transactions. Amounts included in the table below are based on the assumption that the
Transactions occurred on November 2, 2021. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts
depending on several factors, including differences from the estimates of outstanding amounts of
existing indebtedness to be repaid on the Issue Date, the estimated amount of cash of the SSN Issuer
and its subsidiaries as of the Issue Date, as well as the differences between estimated and actual fees
and expenses. Any increase in these amounts will be funded using cash on our balance sheet. In
particular, figures included in the table below differ from the figures used in the table included under
“Capitalization”, which assumes that the Transactions occurred on August 31, 2021.

The gross proceeds from the offering of the PIK Notes by the PIK Issuer will be €235.0 million.
On the Issue Date, the PIK Issuer will use the gross proceeds from the issuance of the PIK Notes to (i)
repay in full and cancel the Existing Mezzanine Loan for approximately €174.4 million (including accrued
and unpaid interest), (ii) make the Midco-NewCo Equity Injection for approximately €40 million, the
proceeds from which will in turn be used by NewCo GB to repay amounts outstanding under the Existing
PIK Notes and (iii) pay certain costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing.

The gross proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes by the SSN Issuer will be
€620.0 million. The SSN Issuer will use the gross proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Secured
Notes and cash on its balance sheet (including approximately €240 million of cash received in
connection with the Quick Disposal) to (i) redeem in full, on the Issue Date, the Existing Notes for
approximately €638.6 million (including accrued and unpaid interest, but excluding call premium), (ii)
repay in full and cancel, on or prior to the Issue Date, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility for an
aggregate principal amount of €20.0 million, (iii) repay in full and cancel, on or prior to the Issue Date,
the existing PGE Loan for an aggregate principal amount €80.0 million, (iv) extend, on the Issue Date,
the NewCo Upstream Proceeds Loan for approximately €196.3 million, the proceeds from which will in
turn be used by NewCo GB to repay in full, along with the proceeds of the Midco-NewCo Equity
Injection, the amounts outstanding under the Existing PIK Notes and (v) pay certain costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing.

Finally, on the Issue Date, NewCo GB will use the gross proceeds from the Midco-NewCo
Equity Injection for approximately €40 million and of the NewCo Upstream Proceeds Loan for
approximately €196 million, to (i) redeem in full the Existing PIK Notes for approximately €234.3 million
(including accrued and unpaid interest, but excluding call premium) and (v) pay certain costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing.

On or prior to the Issue Date, the SSN Issuer will enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, which will provide for a New Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €80.0 million. On the
Issue Date, the New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to remain undrawn.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and the consolidated capitalization
of the SSN Issuer and NewCo GB, as well as of the PIK Issuer, as of August 31, 2021 on an actual
basis and as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions and the Quick Disposal, as if they had occurred
on August 31, 2021. The as adjusted financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA**

**Overview**

The following tables present selected historical consolidated financial information for the SSN
Issuer and other data for the Group, as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019
and 2018 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. The SSN Issuer was established in
October 2013 as a société par actions simplifiée under the laws of France in order to lead and develop
the Burger King brand in France, carry out the activities contemplated by the Master Franchise
Agreement and serve as the Group’s holding company.

The summary unaudited interim consolidated financial information as of and for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 and other financial data presented in the tables below has been derived from the
Interim Financial Statements, a free English translation of which is included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. The summary historical consolidated financial information as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and other financial data presented in the tables below has been
derived from the Audited Financial Statements, free English translations of which are included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The following section contains non-IFRS measures that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. We have included these
measures because the SSN Issuer’s management uses them to measure operating performance in
presentations to its directors and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, as well as in
monitoring, as relevant, certain aspects of its operating cash flows, liquidity and business performance.
See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information”.

The unaudited consolidated income statement and the other financial information presented for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 have been derived by subtracting from the financial information
of the SSN Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 the financial information from the
SSN Issuer’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the six
months ended June 30, 2020, and adding the financial information from the SSN Issuer’s unaudited
condensed interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021.
The unaudited consolidated income statement and the other financial information presented for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not
necessarily representative of the SSN Issuer’s results of operations for any future period or our financial
condition at any future date. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering
Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of the SSN Issuer’s financial reporting and has
not been audited or reviewed.

This section should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum as well as the disclosures provided under “Presentation of Financial and

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION**

**AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations
of the Group in the periods set forth below, based on data extracted from the financial statements of
the SSN Issuer as discussed under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

This discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with IFRS, free English translations of which are included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information,” and “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data”. A_
summary of the Group’s critical accounting policies that have been applied to these financial statements
is set out below under the caption “—Critical Accounting Policies”. The discussion in this section may
contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Group’s plans, estimates and beliefs and involve
risks and uncertainties. The Group’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are
not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, particularly under
“Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements”.

**Overview**

We are Burger King France, resolutely focused on the expansion of the world’s second largest
QSHR chain in the French market which is characterized by secular, long-term demand for eating out
and a strong affinity for our brand. Guided by the Burger King philosophy of “Have it your way”, we offer
customers a differentiated eating experience, combining high-quality food, such as our flame-grilled
hamburgers, with attractive restaurant locations.

In 2013, our principal shareholder Groupe Bertrand reintroduced the Burger King brand to the
French market after a 15-year absence, by signing of an exclusive master franchise agreement between
Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. Groupe Bertrand is a leader
in the French restaurant industry, known for its ability to roll out and transform restaurant concepts.
Following our acquisition in 2015 of Financière Quick Group, an incumbent QSHR operator with nearly
400 prime restaurant locations in France, we demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of
our Burger King network in France, both through the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King
brand, as well as through new Burger King restaurant openings. As of June 30, 2021, we operated
412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be
converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion) and as
of August 31, 2021, we operated 413 restaurants under the Burger King brand (425 restaurants
including nine restaurants under the Quick brand to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term
and three Quick restaurants under conversion).

Our mission is to continue to deliver a high-quality service to our customers and support the
growth of our franchisees through expansion of new Burger King restaurants. We are committed to strict
development criteria, prioritizing sustainable initiatives and seeking to exploit economies of scale to
further growing our EBITDA. Our business model features a mix of predominantly Franchise with Lease
Management Restaurants and Pure Franchise Restaurants, and to a lesser extent Company
Restaurants. We believe this model enables us to manage our growth flexibly while controlling the
locations of the restaurants in our network. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 83% of our Burger King
restaurants are Franchise Restaurants under our Burger King brand and the remaining 17% are
Company Restaurants, a balance that supports our gross margin and reduces our capital expenditure
requirement for expansion. As of June 30, 2021, we were the direct lessee for or owner of approximately
87% of the restaurant locations in our network, compared to 85% of the restaurant locations in our
network as of December 31, 2018.

-----

In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s,
KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked
customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. The strong recognition of
the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide,
serves as a solid base to attract customers and prospective franchisees.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) for Burger
King restaurants was approximately €2.8 million.

We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with locations throughout the country and
approximately 15% market share by sales of burgers in 2021 (up from 8% in 2017), generating
€1,056.7 million in SWS, €448.3 million in revenue (reported) and €151.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA
(reported) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, with 412 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 (399
of which were under the Burger King brand).

**Presentation of Financial and Other Information**

The SSN Issuer was established in October 2013 as a société par actions simplifiée under the
laws of France in order to lead and develop the Burger King brand in France, carry out the activities
contemplated by the Master Franchise Agreement and serve as the Group’s holding company. The
SSN Issuer prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.

The PIK Issuer was incorporated on April 13, 2018 as a société par actions simplifiée under the
laws of France.

The PIK Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations of its own and whose
assets as of June 30, 2021 consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of NewCo GB.

Following the Post-Closing Merger, whereby NewCo GB will be merged with, and into, the SSN
Issuer, the assets of the PIK Issuer will consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of the SSN
Issuer. See "Summary—The Transactions—The Post-Closing Merger".

The PIK Issuer does not prepare, and does not intend to prepare, consolidated financial
statements at the level of the PIK Issuer.

As a result, this Offering Memorandum presents consolidated financial and other data for the
SSN Issuer only.

**_Financial Statements_**

The financial statements used in this Offering Memorandum are the consolidated financial
statements of the SSN Issuer prepared in accordance with IFRS for the six months ended June 30,
2021, as well as for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

During the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, we have adopted certain
accounting standards that may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information
presented herein. For a further description of these accounting standards and the impact of their
adoption on our financial statements, see "—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial
_Information Presented—Changes in accounting methods"._

In addition, in 2019 we implemented a carve-out of our Quick activities, as a result of which we
have applied IFRS 5 to our financial statements to reflect the classification of such Quick activities as

91


-----

discontinued operations from the period beginning January 1, 2019 and have restated 2018
comparative figures to reflect this classification. "—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial
_Information Presented—Changes in Consolidation Scope". As a result of the foregoing, our results of_
operations may not be directly comparable from one period to the next.

Unless otherwise indicated, the period-to-period comparison of our results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations” are presented on a pre-IFRS 16 including IFRS IC ( cancellation_
of IFRS 16 entries and rents' recognition) and pre-IFRS 5 (cancellation of the IFRS 5 (discontinued
operations) entries, and addition of the depreciation and amortization related to the assets held for sale
as if they had been maintained.

In order to provide further detail on the impact of our restatements applied to our reported
financial statements, reconciliations from our reported results of operations and cash flows as of and
for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2020, the year ended December
31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 to the restated figures for such periods, including
IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC), IFRS 5 and D&A related to assets held for sale adjustments only for the
six months ended June 30, 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended December
31, 2020, due to the fact that for the year ended December 31, 2019, the D&A related to the assets
held for sale were already included in the reported figures, have been presented under "—
_Reconciliations_ _of our results of operations — Impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC),_
_IFRS 5 and D&A related to assets held for sale" and “—Reconciliations of our cash flows — Impact of_
_the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC)”. In addition, a reconciliation from our reported results of_
operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the restated figures for such periods has been
provided to reflect the impact of our application of IFRS 5 only.

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Information Presented**

Set forth below are certain factors that affect the comparability of the financial information
presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations”._

**_Changes in consolidation scope_**

In 2019, the Group began a legal reorganization of its Quick activities in order to prepare for
the subsequent carve-out of Quick's activities (including 107 Quick restaurants) (the “Quick Carve**Out”), with the aim of focusing on the further development of the Burger King brand in France. In**
accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, beginning
with our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we have accounted for
certain Quick activities falling within the scope of the Quick Carve-Out in our financial statements as
discontinued operations.

Unless otherwise indicated, the period-to-period comparison of our results of operations and
cash flows for all periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations” are presented on a pre-IFRS 5 basis (i.e., including our_
discontinued operations and depreciation and amortization related to assets held for sale). In order to
provide prospective investors with the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing
our operating performance, we have prepared reconciliations from our reported results of operations
and cash flows as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2020,
the year ended December 31, 2020, the year ended December 31, 2019 to the restated figures for such
periods, including IFRS 5 adjustments and other adjustments, as set forth under "—Reconciliations of
_our results of operations — Impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC), IFRS 5 and D&A_
_related to assets held for sale " and “—Reconciliations of our cash flows — Impact of the application of_
_IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC)”. In addition, a reconciliation from our reported results of operations for the_
year ended December 31, 2018 to the restated figures for such periods has been provided to reflect the
impact of our application of IFRS 5 only.

**_Changes in accounting methods_**

The following is a discussion of certain changes in accounting methods that affect the
comparability of our results of operations during the periods under review. For a further discussion of
changes in accounting methods that have occurred, see note 3.2 to our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and our audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Offering
Memorandum.

_IFRS 16 — leases_

IFRS 16 (Leases), which the IASB published on January 13, 2016 and which became
mandatory for companies reporting according to IFRS from January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction
between operating and finance leases, and requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance
sheet. Under this new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability,
measured as the net present value of future lease payments, are recognized. Short-term leases and
low-value leases are exempted. The new standard affects certain commonly used financial ratios and
performance metrics because of its impact on the balance sheet and on the nature of expenses related
to leases, as rent expenses are substantially replaced with depreciation and finance costs. IFRS 16
requires lessees to recognize assets corresponding to the right to use the underlying leased asset for
the estimated term of the lease, as well as liabilities corresponding to the discounted obligation to make
lease payments for substantially all leases. Operating lease expense in the consolidated income
statement is replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset, presented in depreciation and
amortization (restaurants) and depreciation and amortization (corporate center), and interest expense
on the financial liability, presented in other financial expenses. Regarding the statement of cash flows,
the financing cash flows are impacted by the repayment of the debt and interest expenses.

The new lease accounting rules under IFRS 16 primarily affect the accounting for our operating
leases. Our principal leased assets include our stores, offices, data storage and vehicles. Previously,
each lease contract was qualified under the roles of IAS 17 as either a finance lease or as an operating
lease, with accounting treatment appropriate for each category.

We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019.
In the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we
applied the modified retrospective transition approach and without restatement for the comparative
information for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the discount rates we applied as of the
transition date are based on the Group's marginal borrowing rate. These discount rates are determined
with respect to the remaining terms of leases from the date of first-time application on January 1, 2019.

Unless otherwise indicated, the period-to-period comparison of our results of operations and
cash flows for all periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations”, are on a pre-IFRS 16 basis._

However, in order to provide prospective investors with the same information that we use
internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance, we have prepared reconciliations from
our reported results of operations and cash flows as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021,
the six months ended June 30, 2020, the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December
31, 2019 to the restated figures for such periods, including IFRS 16 adjustments and other adjustments,
is set forth under the section titled "—Reconciliations of our results of operations — Impact of the
_application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC), IFRS 5 and D&A related to assets held for sale " and “—_
_Reconciliations of our cash flows — Impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC)_ ”.

_IFRS IC conclusion for IFRS 16_

On December 16, 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee published its decision on (i)
determining the enforceable period of an automatically renewable lease or a lease that can be
terminated by either of the parties with no contractual penalty and (ii) the link between the useful life of
non-removable leasehold improvements and the IFRS 16 lease term. This decision provides
clarifications that may impact the term of leases other than the particular cases mentioned.

In light of this decision, on July 3, 2020, the French accounting standards authority (Autorité
_des Normes Comptables, or the “ANC”) issued a new position statement on July 3, 2020 regarding the_
application of IFRS 16 on French commercial leases that are described as “3-6-9” leases, because such
leases are signed for at least nine years, with unilateral termination possible by the tenant after three
or six years. This statement superseded the ANC’s previous position statement of February 16, 2018.

Subsequent to the issuance of such position statement, we performed a further analysis of our
leases in order to identify contracts whose initial accounting under IFRS 16 could be affected by the
ANC’s position statement. As a result of this further analysis, the Group revised its accounting treatment
of certain lease contracts to reflect an increased estimated term for certain leases. Our analysis focused
on the underlying asset leases (restaurants) including inseparable fixtures and installations, of which
the residual net book value at the end of the estimated lease period pursuant to the IFRS 16 standard
may constitute a significant penalty (within the meaning of the decision of the IFRS Interpretations
Committee) for the Group.

The revised accounting treatment of such leases were retrospectively recognized at the date
of transition to IFRS 16 (January 1, 2019), which resulted in a restatement of our consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Unless otherwise indicated, the period-to-period comparison of our results of operations for all
periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations”,_ are on a pre-IFRS 16 basis, and therefore do not reflect the application of the decision
of the IFRS Interpretations Committee.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Set forth below are certain key factors that historically have affected our results of operations,
and which may impact our results of operations in the future.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

As a food service provider with hundreds of restaurant locations, we have been affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic and the various health protection measures that have been adopted by the French
government. These measures include government-mandated shutdowns of restaurants, country-wide
lockdowns and mandatory safety measures across all our operations in France. As a result, we have
been required to manage the numbers of customers in our restaurants, reduce or temporarily close the
operation of certain of our restaurants following evolving guidelines or orders by the French government,
invest in protective and other safety equipment and increase our reliance on home delivery and Click &
Collect purchase options. For example, as a result of the first lockdown in France, a large majority of
our restaurants were shut down from March 17, 2020 through the end of April 2020, after which we
underwent, and are still undergoing, a period of gradual and progressive reopening of all our
restaurants.

In response to these government restrictions that limited our operations, we adopted various
measures to strengthen our liquidity position, including by drawing in full our Existing Revolving Credit
Facility for a total of €60 million and entering into the state-guaranteed PGE Loan (contrat de prêts
_garantis par l’État français) for a total of €80 million. Once the PGE Loan was secured, we used our_

94


-----

cash available to repay €40 million of the amounts we borrowed under the Existing Revolving Credit
Facility. In addition, from the period beginning on March 19, 2020 through the end of May 2020, we
placed most of our staff, both at our restaurants and in our headquarters, under temporarily
unemployment. We also ceased most external service expenditures such as cleaning, security and
maintenance, both in our restaurants and at our headquarters, and renegotiated our rental obligations
for the period with our landlords. In addition, we implemented temporary royalty adjustments to support
our franchisees, which resulted in a reduction in the revenue we generated from our franchisees during
the first half of 2020.

A breakdown of our quarterly cash flow generation (including our discontinued activity) for the
periods impacted by COVID-19, beginning on January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, is set forth below:

During the periods presented above, we experienced negative working capital following the
COVID-19 crisis as a result of payments to landlords, delayed suppliers' liabilities and a decrease in
receivables. However, we experienced a working capital inflow in the three months ended June 30,
2021 as a result of a decrease in trade receivables on our CPI activity (as defined below) and an
increase in our financial liabilities driven by VAT.

As a result of the various measured adopted by the government to curb the spread of COVID19, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were materially impacted. While we
have recorded continued positive performance in the six months ended June 30, 2021, government
measures in response to the evolving pandemic continue to be uncertain. As a result, the impact of the
pandemic on our results of operations will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be
accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any
resurgence in the future) and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of evolving
government containment efforts, all of which are beyond our knowledge and control.

**_Consumer preferences and societal trends, general economic conditions and consumer_**
**_sentiment_**

We operate in the QSHR category of the QSR segment and our results of operations during
the periods under review have been, and in the future may continue to be, affected by changes in
consumer preferences and societal trends. Among the most significant trends that have affected our
results of operations is the increased prevalence of eating away from home as the habits of the French
population begins to exhibit greater convergence with other Northern European countries. As a result,
the restaurant industry has grown in line with this increase in out-of-home dining. Demographic, social
and economic trends underlying this decline include profound shifts in the way people live, work and
eat in recent decades that have accelerated with economic and technological changes. More people
are living alone, which means that people are eating out alone, stopping to eat while in transit or getting
together to eat outside the home as a social activity. In addition, more French households with children
have dual incomes, meaning both parents are working and more likely to be on the go during the week
and pressed for time on the weekends. Moreover, more French young people are working while

95


-----

pursuing their studies and therefore have comparatively more spending power than prior generations.
These demographic, social and economic changes support the QSR segment, and in particular the
QSHR market within the QSR segment, as the price points are accessible, customer service delivery is
geared towards efficiency and the portion sizes can be generous. According to GIRA Foodservice,
during the periods under review, the QSR market grew at a CAGR of 6.8% per annum between 2017
and 2019, although it decreased in 2020 by 31.2% compared to 2019 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Despite the temporary slowdown in the growth of the QSR market during the COVID-19 outbreak, the
QSR market significantly outperformed the broader OOH market during such periods, with the QSR
segment generating approximately €13.4 billion in sales in 2020, representing a decline of
approximately 31.2% as compared to 2019; whereas the French OOH market overall declined by 37.7%
during the same period. According to NPD Group, the QSR market also increased its share of the OOH
market from 35% in 2017 to 44% in 2020, reaching 62% for the three months ended March 30, 2021.
In particular, during the same periods, the QSHR market grew at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2017 and
2019, decreasing only by 22% compared to 2019 due to COVID-19 impacts. Its share in the QSR market
increased from 33% in 2017 to 38% in the first quarter of 2021. See “Industry”. Additionally, we believe
that these societal trends contributed to increase footfall which had a positive impact on our results of
operations, during the pre-COVID-19 periods under review.

Our results of operations are also influenced by changes in consumer preferences and trends
regarding taste, packaging, ordering and customer service. To the extent we are able to maintain a
fresh brand image and good reputation among consumers for products that appeal to them, our results
of operations will be positively affected. Conversely, if we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond
to such changes by evolving our product offering, menu customization options, portion sizing, pricing
and other aspects of our business operations adequately and in a timely fashion, our results of
operations may be adversely affected. We are constantly seeking to stay at the vanguard of consumer
preferences through product offering and customer service, and have begun initiatives to better satisfy
customer needs, for example through the improvements to the Burger King mobile app, which facilitate
the ordering of Click & Collect options, as well as integrate our customer loyalty program.

In addition, our results of operations are also affected to a degree by global economic conditions
and specific local economic conditions in the markets and geographic areas in which we operate. Such
conditions include levels of employment, disposable income, consumer confidence and consumer
willingness to spend, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including gross domestic product and
interest and inflation rates. During the periods under review, our results of operations were affected by
the state of the French economy. According to INSEE, France's GDP grew at only 1.9% in 2018 and
1.8% in 2019, followed by a significant drop of 7.9% in 2020, which is mainly attributed to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. During periods of economic growth, consumers tend to eat outside the home
more frequently, young people (an important demographic for the QSHR sector), tend to have more
disposable income and consumers generally tend to travel more often for work or leisure, all of which
can lead to greater traffic in our restaurants and contribute to System-wide sales ("SWS") generation.
Conversely, during periods with unfavorable economic conditions characterized by stagnant or negative
GDP growth and/or a decrease in disposable income, consumers may reduce the frequency with which
they dine out or choose more inexpensive restaurants when dining away from home. Unfavorable
changes in general economic conditions, therefore, can reduce customer traffic, as consumers may
prefer to prepare food at home, or comparison shop for the best promotional deals from restaurants,
which can reduce our total sales. Nevertheless, we believe that our positioning in the QSR segment
with good value-for-money products mitigates the impact of potential changes in general and local
economic conditions as this sector has historically been relatively resilient.

In addition, customer traffic is a product of, among other things, consumer sentiment which can
be affected by significant global or national events. Large-scale sporting or cultural events can
encourage additional travel to certain regions by domestic and international tourists, which can drive
traffic at certain restaurant locations where the event is held or on routes to such locations. Conversely,
events such as terrorist attacks or civil disturbances such as prolonged labor strikes can negatively
affect our results of operations and discourage customers from dining out, particularly if transportation
networks are disrupted. For example, our operations in France were most impacted by the Yellow Vests
(Gilet Jaune) protests, which caused intermittent traffic blockades and transportation disruptions,
particularly in downtown areas, limiting foot traffic and access to our restaurants, during the period from

96


-----

roughly November 2018 through early 2019. Following these protests, consumers may have been less
likely to patronize our restaurants in and around the affected areas or in urban centers generally which
partially offset increased sales recorded by our restaurants during the same period.

**_Evolution of our network_**

One of the drivers of our results of operations is the size and evolution of our restaurant network.
Our historical strategy of converting existing Quick restaurants into the Burger King brand permitted the
Group to accelerate its development of the Burger King brand in France. Additionally, we opened new
restaurants during the period under review as we sought to continue to expand our nationwide
coverage. As a result, our network of Burger King restaurants expanded from 203 as of December 31,
2017 to 399 as of June 30, 2021. Concurrently, the number of Quick restaurants operated by the Group
in mainland France during the period under review decreased from 252 as of December 31, 2017
(excluding four restaurants temporarily closed and under conversion to the Burger King brand) to 110
as of June 30, 2021 (excluding two restaurants temporarily closed and under conversion to the Burger
King brand) due to closures and conversions to the Burger King brand. The recent disposal of our Quick
operations (see "Summary—Recent Developments") will allow us to further focus on the expansion of
the Burger King brand in France.

Our results and our margins are also affected by the evolution of the mix between Company
Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants in our network. Company Restaurants add additional costs to
our structure, such as personnel costs and lease costs that we cannot ultimately recuperate from our
Franchise Restaurants (as is the case with our Franchise with Lease Management restaurants),
generally resulting in a lower margin of SWS when compared to Franchise Restaurants. In addition, we
generally incur capital expenditures and pre-opening costs with each new Company Restaurant,
whereas due to franchise arrangements, the cash flow impact on the Group for adding a new Franchise
Restaurant is more limited and the sales and margin impact may be significant. Additionally, the cost of
converting a Franchise Restaurant is also more limited in terms of investment than opening a Company
Restaurant, though the return in terms of additional royalties is significant.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30,
2021 we opened 25, 25, 21 and 17 restaurants, respectively, of which seven, three, one and none were
Company Restaurants. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months
ended June 30, 2021, we converted 63, 29, nine and 15 restaurants, respectively, of which 16, six, four
and one were Company Restaurants. We generally record pre-opening costs corresponding to wages
prior to trading, training and pre-IFRS16 rent. During years with a high number of Company Restaurant
openings, such costs may be unevenly distributed and disproportionally recorded during certain
quarters before the sales uplift is experienced. This necessary network growth may affect certain cost
items in our consolidated income statement as well as our cash flow related to investing activities in our
consolidated cash flow statement. We expect this opening effect to continue to be recorded, though the
mix of Company Restaurants opened will likely diminish over time as network expansion stabilizes. See
also “—Key Performance Indicators—Number of restaurants” below for a discussion of restaurant
openings and closings.

In addition, QSHR restaurant locations generally require a certain level of renovation and
refurbishment every six to seven years in order to maintain customer traffic. As almost 50% of our
Burger King restaurants have opened or have been converted from former Quick restaurants within the
last three years, renovation and refurbishment expenses have mostly stemmed from our operation of
Quick branded restaurants. Furthermore, the works undertaken as part of the conversion process from
Quick branded restaurants to the Burger King brand are sufficient to restart the refurbishment cycle for
such restaurants.

The following discusses the main trends discernable when examining the evolution of our
network during the periods under review that affected our results of operations.

97


-----

The “novelty effect”, which we use to describe the strong sales performance experienced by
newly-opened and converted Burger King restaurants, records ARS in their first few months of
operations that are significantly higher than the monthly ARS of the entire Burger King network for the
full year. We believe the novelty effect results from the strong brand equity that Burger King enjoys in
the French market as a relatively newly-arrived challenger in a market long dominated by McDonald’s.
Also contributing to this effect is Burger King’s strong value proposition characterized by good quality
ingredients and great taste at accessible prices, which resonates with customers. As a result, Burger
King restaurants register minimal ramp up time as the first month’s ARS typically exceeds that of the
entire Group perimeter.

Factors that can affect the intensity and duration of the novelty effect include, among other
things:

    - the number of Burger King restaurants in the catchment area (generally the novelty effect
is more pronounced for the first restaurant);

    - the distance to competitor’s restaurants;

    - the demographics of the catchment area; and

    - the characteristics of the restaurant (i.e., city center, suburban area, shopping mall or
drive-through location).

The higher ARS generated by Burger King restaurants as compared to Quick restaurants
recorded during the periods under review is largely attributable to higher customer traffic. As a result,
by increasing the number of Burger King restaurants in the network, through both organic expansion
and the conversion of Quick restaurants, our revenues generated directly by Company Restaurants,
and indirectly from Franchise Restaurant through royalties and lease payments, increased.

As we have progressed in our conversion efforts, the weight of pre-existing Burger King
restaurants has increased in our calculation of ARS, and due to the waning of the novelty effect as to
those restaurants, the ARS for our Burger King restaurants as a whole may slightly decrease, as it did
for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year prior.

The pace of the growth of our network has depended, and in the future will likely depend, on a
combination of factors, including, among other things, the prioritization of certain clusters to achieve
better network density in the Burger King restaurant network and decreased logistics costs, receipt of
necessary permits and landlord consents, securing financing in the case of franchisees (as applicable)
and discussions with franchisees. As a result, the restaurants opened or converted during the periods
under review represent a mix of locations, categories and sizes, thereby producing non-uniform effects
on our results of operations depending on the circumstances.

**_Franchise arrangements and franchisee performance_**

We are the master franchisee of Burger King in France and the former franchisor for Quick, and
royalties, entry fees and lease payments from lease management arrangements have contributed
significantly to our results of operations during the periods under review. Our franchisees are
independent entrepreneurs who remunerate us by paying one-off entry fees upon the opening or
conversion of their restaurants and through the payment of a certain percentage of their sales as brand
royalties (part of which we in turn pay to BK Europe for those restaurants operated under the Burger
King brand). Moreover, for Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, which represent the
majority of our Franchise Restaurants, we also receive lease payments as a percentage of sales. As a
result of our franchise arrangements, our results of operations and our profitability are significantly
affected in a positive way when Burger King’s ARS is performing well. We generally prefer to use
franchises as we believe that our franchisees’ overall expertise at running restaurants results in better
performance.

98


-----

During the periods under review, our franchisor network grew in line with the further
development of the Burger King network through both the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger
King brand as franchise restaurants, as well as organic new franchise restaurant openings. In line with
our strategy, most such franchises were opened under our Franchise with Lease Management
Restaurants arrangement.

For more information on our franchise arrangements and royalties collected, see “Business—
_Our Business—Restaurant operations”._

**_Cost base_**

Our cost base is comprised of a mixture of variable, semi-variable and fixed costs. Variable
costs primarily include food and logistics costs and selling costs. Operating and occupancy costs
(including rental expenses), as well as general & administrative expenses are mainly fixed costs, while
personnel costs have both a fixed and semi-variable component. Personnel costs related to staff in
Company Restaurants are semi-variable whereas personnel costs in connection with headquarters and
Company Restaurants’ management is generally fixed. In the event of a decrease in SWS, we may not
be able to reduce our cost base in a timely manner, in particular as it relates to our fixed costs, which
could adversely impact our margins. However, in the event of an increase in SWS, we benefit from a
strong operational leverage as SWS growth allows favorable scale effects.

The following sections discuss the main factors affecting the principal items of our cost base.

_Food and logistics costs_

Beginning on March 31, 2019, Franchise Restaurants under both the Burger King brand and
the Quick brand are responsible for their own food and logistics costs as Burger King’s model is based
on the outsourcing of food purchases and logistics services. Prior to March 31, 2019, food purchases
and logistics services for Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand were managed
through a dedicated Group subsidiary. However, for Company Restaurants under both Burger King and
Quick brands, we source a wide range of ingredients, including beef and chicken, potatoes and other
fresh and frozen products, and a variety of sauces to form our menu and we also incur logistics costs
to store inventory and transport raw materials and semi-finished products to such restaurant locations.
Our food and logistics costs for Company Restaurants were €91.3 million, €54.3 million and €58.2
million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, respectively, representing 15.5%, 13.0% and 11.4% of our total sales and franchise revenues for
the same periods, respectively.

As we are the master franchisee of BK Europe for France, we must use approved packaging
and source from approved suppliers with plants that have passed inspection by BKC or its affiliates.
During the periods under review, we have developed a significant French network of approved
suppliers, which has helped to control our logistics costs as a percentage of revenues as we no longer
need to heavily rely on imports of raw materials and semi-finished goods from approved suppliers in
neighboring European countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria.

In addition, many of the ingredients we use in preparing our food are commodities and are
subject to price volatility, notably beef. We purchase all of our beef from suppliers that are strictly
required to purchase beef only from the European Union, with a limited number of countries of origin
(France, Germany and Austria). More than 50% of our beef comes from France. European beef prices
are driven by the interplay of supply and demand dynamics. During the periods under review, prices for
European beef were on an upward trend.

We seek to optimize spending on ingredients, reduce our exposure to price fluctuations and
contain logistics costs through a variety of measures, including regular review of our supply contracts,
maintain contacts with multiple suppliers, focusing our cost control measures on prevention of food

99


-----

waste and actively planning our network growth in clusters to reduce logistics costs. Examples of cost
control initiatives or events during the periods under review include: (i) use of futures and hedging on
certain raw materials purchased from our suppliers; (ii) further development and growth of a
BKC-approved supplier network in France, which allows us to obtain better pricing and reduce logistics
costs; (iii) secured sourcing plans in France and Europe; and (iv) supplier contingency plans, both with
respect to the number of suppliers in France and the expansion of our supplier network in other
countries.

We expect food and logistics costs to decrease as the network grows and becomes more
dense. Enhanced buying power owing to the growth of our network has helped, and potentially in the
future can help, us to attain high standards of product quality and more competitive pricing. These
factors can have positive effects on our customer proposition and the profit margins of our Company
Restaurants, though we expect that they will not affect our franchise revenues since our royalties and
lease payments are calculated as a percentage of their sales. An ancillary benefit of our cost reduction
initiatives is that franchisees may have greater financial means to invest more quickly in a second or
third Burger King restaurant. The effectiveness of our supply and logistics chain can also impact our
costs of sales and administration expenses.

See “Business—Group Operations—Procurement and logistics—Raw materials supply” for
more information.

_Leasehold and occupancy costs_

We currently rent almost all of our Company Restaurants and our Franchise with Lease
Management Restaurants through commercial or ground leases. We are the tenant of record for both
types of restaurants, though pursuant to our Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, the
franchisee pays us a percentage of sales for rent, generally with a fixed minimum. Franchise with Lease
Management arrangements, discussed in more detail under “—Franchise arrangements and franchisee
_performance” require us to be liable for the rent payment. However, not only do they provide us with_
control over the real estate, but the percentage of sales paid by the franchisee compensates us for our
ownership and management of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and covers the
underlying leasehold costs. Due to the strong ARS generated by the Burger King brand, as the ratio of
Burger King restaurants to Quick restaurants has increased during the periods under review, our
leasehold costs have improved as a percentage of revenues. Further, during the periods under review,
in each conversion of a Quick Franchise Restaurant with Lease Management, the rent remained the
same for the existing leasehold while the ARS improved significantly, thereby yielding higher lease
payments from the franchisees, which contributed to our gross margin. Our leasehold and occupancy
costs for restaurants were €67.2 million, €66.1 million and €68.3 million during the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, representing
approximately 11%, 16% and 14% of our revenues for the same periods, respectively.

Commercial leases generally have a term of nine years, typically with early termination options
for the tenant every three years and an automatic renewal right for the tenant at the end of the term.
Since mid-2019, we have entered into several lease agreements with longer terms of up to twelve
years for some of our new Burger King restaurant openings. Ground leases (usually related to
freestanding restaurants with their own parking spaces and grounds) typically have a longer term of
30 years. Our leases generally contain an annual increase pursuant to an indexation clause that is
based on, among other things, inflation. Increases in our leasehold and occupancy costs occur when
we open new Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants. Opening
new restaurants also has the effect of increasing restaurant overhead more broadly with additional rent,
fixtures, insurance and other costs. Certain restaurant locations, particularly in transportation locations
and at large shopping malls, may have a variable rent set at a percentage of sales, typically with a
certain minimum rent. See “Business—Real Estate”.

To manage leasehold and occupancy costs, we focus on site selection, the right-sizing of the
restaurant, and the negotiation of leases that are realistic in terms of the sales that such location can
generate. In this process, we are informed by the data from our other restaurants and we are guided by

100


-----

conservative guidelines for rent as a percentage of sales. In connection with the conversion of Quick
restaurants to Burger King restaurants, we are committed to securing the lease agreement with the
landlord prior to the conversion when the conversion is planned to take place at the end of the lease
period. We are also leveraging Groupe Bertrand’s long history and know-how in site selection in order
to reduce costs. See “Business—Our Network—Site selection”.

As the Burger King network expanded during the period under review, leasehold and
occupancy costs were better absorbed as a percentage of revenues. In connection with the continued
development of the Burger King brand in France, we have decided to enter into Franchise with Lease
Management agreements with our franchisees going forward. We expect that occupancy costs will rise
in the aggregate but decline as a percentage of revenues as Franchise with Lease Management
locations take on a larger proportion of our franchise arrangements. We believe this will result from the
fact that lease payments under Franchise with Lease Management arrangements will more than
compensate for the higher leasehold and occupancy cost base.

_Labor costs_

In addition to the cost of our headquarters staff and management, we hire employees (whom
we refer to as “team members”) directly for our Company Restaurants, while franchisees are
responsible for their own labor costs. Labor costs primarily comprise the salaries of team members
employed in individual restaurants plus managers and restaurant directors. The QSHR category is
labor-intensive, which is compounded by the fact that pursuant to French law and the applicable
collective bargaining agreements for the fast food sector, our ability to make use of part-time work and
require overtime is limited to certain prescribed thresholds. Though labor costs are largely fixed,
restaurants directors and managers receive a variable component of their compensation based on ARS
and other performance indicators such as profitability and respect of brand standards (e.g., quality and
service). During the periods under review, as the Burger King network was expanding, we regularly
made new hires for new Company Restaurants and for our general & administrative structure to gear
for growth, and our results of operations reflect the integration of such employees into our cost structure.
Additionally, a portion of pre-opening costs generally includes employee wages as staff must complete
training prior to the opening of the relevant Company Restaurant. The QSR segment generally has a
high turnover among team members, which can increase training costs and reduce productivity, but
gives us some flexibility to adapt the staffing level to the level of sales through attrition when sales
decrease. Our Company Restaurants’ labor costs were €100.8 million, €62.7 million and €61.8 million
during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021,
respectively, representing 17.2%, 15.0% and 12.1% of our total sales and franchise revenues for the
same periods, respectively.

We seek to manage labor costs based on right sizing the staff for each Company Restaurant
according to restaurant size and the expected footfall informed by similarly situated restaurants. We
also focus a portion of our new restaurant development efforts on originating drive-through locations
which tend to be more efficient from a labor-cost point of view because of the higher traffic that easily
absorbs the additional staff cost. Moreover, we have been investing in point-of-sale and cooking
equipment systems that seek to efficiently manage order, preparation and dispatch flow in the front of
the house and kitchen. For new restaurant openings, applicable collective bargaining agreements for
the fast food sector allow us to use short-term contracts and part-time work, which helps us to
accommodate the higher footfall trends during the novelty effect period and also ensure the correct
staffing level for the particular restaurant. We also manage team members on short-term contracts by
attrition, given the high turnover in the QSR segment. We focus on internal promotion of restaurant
managers from the ranks of team members.

**_Product attractiveness and brand equity_**

Sales and margins in the QSHR category can be impacted by the relative success of new
products launched. The success of new burgers is attributable to a variety of factors, including the
attractiveness and taste of the product, suitability of the product to changing consumer preferences,
perceived product quality and competition from other comparable products launched by our

101


-----

competitors. Launch of a successful new product or an in-demand limited time offer can result in a sales
uplift by encouraging additional orders from our customers. Conversely, a lack of new product offerings,
an unsuccessful product or an incomplete roll-out of a new product can decrease sales if customers
are not satisfied. Examples of new products during the period under review are the launch of gourmet
burgers with premium ingredients, plant-based burger options and additional healthy menu items such
as fresh bowls.

Brand equity is another factor that can affect results of operations for operators in the QSR
segment. Positive associations regarding product quality, service, and value for money, among other
factors, can help consumers make a decision regarding which QSHR restaurant to patronize. The
Burger King brand was re-introduced in France in 2012 following a 15-year absence. In 2021, Burger
King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s
and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt
about the food at each of these QSR brands (increasing our position by 6 percentage points as
compared to the same survey in 2018). We believe that the following characteristics differentiate Burger
King in the market place and help enhance our market position, which contributed to our results of
operations during the periods under review: (i) flame-grilled patties; (ii) customization under the “Have
it Your Way” slogan; (iii) fresh ingredients; (iv) generous portion sizes; and (v) healthy dining options.
During the periods under review, as the network of Burger King restaurants expanded, brand awareness
increased and accelerated through word-of-mouth and the Group’s advertising campaigns on various
media. The development in France of the Burger King brand, a brand with worldwide currency and a
strong challenger positioning to McDonald’s in many other jurisdictions, has resulted in increasing
awareness of the Burger King brand in France, which has helped to enhance ARS for Burger King
locations and was a significant contributor to our revenues during the years periods under review.

**_Marketing and digital presence_**

In order to spread awareness of the Burger King brand and maintain and defend market share
for the Quick brand, we undertake regular marketing campaigns and maintain an extensive digital
presence. Franchisees under the Burger King brand and the Quick brands contribute 3.5% of their sales
and between 4.5% and 5.0% of their sales, respectively, to a marketing budget to which we also
contribute the same percentage from our Company Restaurants sales. We then work with advertising
agencies to plan and execute campaigns that resonate with our target audiences. During the periods
under review, we opted for a strong digital presence, producing “viral” video clips targeted to young
people that were widely shared on social media, amplifying our ability to connect with potential
customers. During the periods under review, the development of the Burger King network and brand in
France allowed for an increased national marketing budget through which Burger King strengthened its
marketing campaigns by commencing national television advertising. In addition to national advertising,
we leverage our restaurant locations as another medium of communication with our customers primarily
through local advertising and promotion campaigns. In the case of both brands, amounts collected from
franchisees for such brand’s marketing and advertising budget generally must be spent during the
course of the same year. We closely monitor the marketing spending and frequency of our competitors’
advertising and promotion campaigns and endeavor to maintain a relatively constant investment in
order to maintain an appropriate communication presence.

**Key Performance Indicators**

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and
financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are the number
and type of restaurants in our network, Average Restaurant Sales (“ARS”) and Adjusted Run-rate
EBITDA performance. Such indicators are either purely operational in nature, include financial
information not derived from the Group’s accounting system (i.e., SWS includes sales recorded by
franchisees and not revenues received by the Group) and/or are not recognized measurements of
financial performance under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS
_Financial Information”._

**_Number of restaurants_**

The number of restaurants consists of the total restaurants open at the relevant date, including
both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. The number of restaurants is a good indicator
of market penetration, the density of our network and our ability to successfully originate leasehold
locations and new franchise arrangements for Burger King restaurants.

The following table presents the number of restaurants in our network by type, brand and
geography as of the dates indicated.

(1) Includes six Quick restaurants temporarily closed as of December 31, 2018 for conversion into Burger King, of which three

were Company restaurants, and three were Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants.

(2) Includes one Quick Franchise with Lease Management Restaurant temporarily closed as of December 31, 2019 for

conversion into Burger King.

(3) Includes seven Quick Franchise with Lease Management restaurants temporarily closed as of December 31, 2020 for

conversion into Burger King.

(4) Includes two Quick Franchise with Lease Management restaurants temporarily closed as of June 30, 2021 for conversion

into Burger King. The Group has recently disposed of the remaining restaurants that it was operating under the Quick brand,
including all restaurants operated internationally. See "Summary—Recent Developments—Quick Disposal". We currently
operate 11 Quick restaurants (not including the two restaurants under conversion as of June 30, 2021) pursuant to the terms
of the Quick License Agreement.

(5) Quick has historically had a more heterogeneous mix of franchise arrangements which included variations of pure franchise

and franchise with lease management arrangements. For simplification of the presentation, all arrangements with some
degree of lease management have been recorded as “Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants” and the remainder
has been recorded as “Pure Franchise Restaurants”.

(6) Includes Franchise Restaurants in the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique as of December 31, 2018, as well

as Morocco for all periods presented.

(7) Includes restaurants that are a part of our discontinued operations perimeter.

In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we had 468 restaurants in our network
(consisting of 252 Quick restaurants, 203 Burger King restaurants, four Quick restaurants under
conversion and nine international restaurants), of which 74% were Franchise Restaurants. During the
year ended December 31, 2016, we had 462 restaurants in our network (consisting of 339 Quick
restaurants, 108 Burger King restaurants, eight Quick restaurants under conversion and seven
international restaurants), of which 71% were Franchise Restaurants.

During the periods under review, the main trends in our restaurant network have been: (i) an
expansion of the Burger King network, with an increasing share of Franchise with Lease Management
arrangements and an acceleration of Burger King openings resulting from Quick conversions; (ii) a
contraction of the Quick network resulting from conversions into Burger King restaurants and closures
of certain loss-making restaurants; and (iii) an increased focus on Franchise with Lease Management
restaurants, our preferred franchise arrangement. Due to the variations in the economic terms of our
franchise arrangements between Pure Franchise and Franchise with Lease Management, the growth
of Franchise with Lease Management can disproportionately increase the franchise revenues

generation as we collect a percentage of sales because the lease and business assets rights (fonds de
_commerce) management fees we collect generally exceeds the fixed lease we pay to the landlord. In_
addition, our results of operations have been affected by outsized contribution of the progressively
larger Burger King network due to its higher ARS. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Evolution of our network”, “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Franchise_
_arrangements and franchisee performance” and “—Average Restaurant Sales” for more information._

**_Average Restaurant Sales_**

Average Restaurant Sales (“ARS”) refers to the annualized monthly average sales (excluding
VAT) recorded per restaurant for the given sample size calculated by: (i) adding all monthly sales
generated for the restaurant sample, but excluding (a) the month in which the opening of any restaurant
occurred (as applicable) or (b) the month in which any restaurant has closed for more than seven days;
(ii) dividing by the number of restaurant months to attain the ARS per month; and (iii) multiplying the
ARS per month by 12 to annualize it. ARS is largely driven by footfall, which is in turn generated by a
variety of factors, including but not limited to, location of the restaurants, product attractiveness, brand
equity, consumer preferences, societal trends, general economic conditions, consumer sentiment,
weather, opening hours, marketing, digital presence and promotional activity and limited time offers.
See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations”.

We use ARS to assess and compare the performance of restaurants by type and brand across
periods. ARS is also used as a benchmark to compute the variable compensation component for
restaurant directors, restaurant managers and team leaders if the relevant Company Restaurant
out-performs. We track ARS as a key performance indicator for the Burger King network and to reduce
the impact of the novelty effect in our internal reporting. Management believes that ARS is the most
useful indicator to assess the sales generation of the Burger King network.

The table below sets forth the ARS evolution for the brands and periods indicated.

(1) To account for the impact of COVID-19 on our restaurant operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six

months ended June 30, 2021, we have excluded periods during which restaurants were closed. However, we have retained
in our sample restaurants that were only partially closed or had limited operations as a result of COVID-19 related
restrictions.

The ARS evolution for Burger King for the periods under review principally reflects the impact
of COVID-19 on the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021. However,
it also demonstrates our ability to maintain a strong ARS despite the increase of new restaurants
operated under the Burger King brand. The ARS of the Burger King restaurants remained strong largely
because of footfall and continued strong resonance of the Burger King brand among its target
demographics. ARS is also affected by the mix in the restaurant network and the change in restaurant
network perimeter. As we plan to complete our Quick conversion or definitive closure efforts in the shortterm, pre-existing Burger King restaurants will make up all of our network, and due to the waning of the
novelty effect as to those restaurants, the ARS for our Burger King restaurants as a whole may
decrease.

**_Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA_**

We use Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as a key performance indicator to measure operating
performance. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is calculated as the EBITDA that the Group would have
generated during the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, as if all of the Burger King restaurants that
were newly opened, converted or temporarily closed for conversion over the period between September
2, 2020 and August 31, 2021 (the "Run-rate Period") had been operational during an entire
twelve-month period.

We believe that Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is a useful indicator of our ability to service our
indebtedness and reflects the profit-generation capacity of our restaurant network for the relevant
period. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is therefore used for internal purposes to evaluate operating
performance of the business for the period utilizing the actual restaurant network composition at the
period-end date.

We may use Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA to analyze our performance in future periods,
depending on the pace of newly opened or converted restaurants, with appropriate changes in the
methodology that our management may determine.

The table below sets forth our Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for the twelve months ended August
31, 2021 and a reconciliation of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA to EBITDA.

**Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA .........................................................................................................................** **176.1**

For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020
and the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, see footnote 1 to “Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Operational Data, including_
_Run-Rate Data”._

We calculate Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA in the following manner:

    - First, we take the Group's LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of August 31, 2021, excluding the
EBITDA generated by discontinued activities as the starting point of the Adjusted Run-Rate
EBITDA calculation.

    - Second, we remove the restaurant operating EBITDA of the Burger King restaurants that
were either opened or converted during Run-Rate Period, and which generated an EBITDA
during the twelve months ended August 31, 2021.

    - Third, we estimate the restaurant operating EBITDA of the Burger King restaurants that
were opened or converted during the Run-rate Period as if they were operational during a
twelve-month period. To do so, we calculate an estimate of the sales that would have been
generated in a twelve-month period as an estimated ARS of €2.8 million (which is in line

105


-----

with the €2.8 million of ARS we generated for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021).
We then apply this ARS to the restaurants in the sample by applying a cost margin or
EBITDA margin, as applicable, to the estimated ARS based on the type of restaurant
included in the sample, as follows:

      - **Company Restaurants: for the four new Burger King Company Restaurants opened**
or converted in the sample, we apply a cost margin to the estimated ARS, calculated
on the basis of the actual restaurant costs of the entire Burger King Company
Restaurant network; and

      - **Franchise Restaurants: for the 62 new Burger King Franchise Restaurants opened or**
converted in the sample, we apply an EBITDA margin to the estimated ARS, calculated
on the basis of the underlying franchise arrangement of each model, _i.e., brand_
royalties for Pure Franchise Restaurants (representing the net amount collected after
BK Europe's royalties); and (ii) brand royalties and lease and business asset fees for
Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants (representing the net amount
collected after BK Europe's royalties plus the net amount collected in lease and
business asset fees after payments to landlords).

    - Fourth, we remove the restaurant operating EBITDA of former Quick restaurants that were
either converted into Burger King restaurants, definitively closed or disposed as of August
31, 2021, and which generated an EBITDA during the twelve-month period ended August
31, 2021.

    - Fifth, we remove the restaurant operating EBITDA of any restaurants that changed their
operating model during the Run-rate Period, and then estimate their restaurant EBITDA as
if they had their new operating model during a twelve-month period. The new EBITDA
restaurant estimations are calculated on the basis of the assumptions underlying the
EBITDA estimations for each operating model described under the third step above. Based
on the changes to their operating models during the period, we applied these calculations
to three Burger King Company Restaurants which transferred into a Franchise Restaurant
under Lease Management.

    - Sixth, in order to account for contractual changes in lease management rates for our
Franchise Restaurants (i.e., as a result of progressive rates applied according to the year
of openings), we remove the amount of franchise revenues generated by the lease
management rate of these franchise restaurants with changed lease management rates
during the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, and then apply the lease management
rates under the current franchise agreements as of August 31, 2021.

Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection, estimate or guarantee of
performance regarding Adjusted EBITDA generation for the year ending December 31, 2021 or any
other future period which may be affected by definitive closures of Quick restaurants, the phasing out
of the novelty effect and the pace of conversions (including the length of temporary closures required
for conversion). Moreover, prospective investors should note that the increase in Adjusted EBITDA
modeled by Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for new restaurant openings and conversions may be offset, to
a degree that will vary on the circumstances, by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the
performance of the remaining Quick network. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—The preparation of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as presented in this_
_Offering Memorandum reflects certain estimates and assumptions which we consider reasonable, but_
_we cannot assure you that we would have achieved such levels of profitability for the twelve-months_
_ended August 31, 2021 had all of our Burger King restaurants in operation or under conversion as of_
_August 31, 2021 been in operation during such period and Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not a projection_
_of future performance”._

Investors should note that EBITDA is not uniformly or legally defined and is not a recognized
indicator under IFRS. Other companies in the QSHR category may calculate EBITDA differently, make
different adjustments or employ other run-rate estimations, and consequently our presentation of these
figures may not be comparable to other companies’ figures and must be read in conjunction with the
discussion of gross margin, operating profit and operating cash flows included elsewhere herein and in
our consolidated financial statements. The adjusted run-rate information presented herein is for
informational purposes only. This information does not necessarily represent the results we would have
achieved had all such newly-opened or converted restaurants been in operation for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and it may
not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations, may not be
comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this
Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed upon it when evaluating an investment
decision. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures”. See also

SWS increased by €194.0 million, or 45.7%, to €618.1 million for the six months ended June
30, 2021 from €424.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020.

This increase in network sales for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 as compared to
the previous year for the same period was driven by: (i) the temporary closures of all restaurants from
March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, (ii) the implementation of other restrictive measures as
a result of COVID-19, (iii) the rebound in activity from May 19, 2021 in connection with the easing of
COVID-19 measures, (iv) new restaurant openings and (v) the development of new sales channels,
such as delivery and Click & Collect options. These effects were offset by the prohibition of in-premises
sales until May 19, 2021, as well as the persistence of other COVID-19 measures enforced during the
second quarter of 2021, including: limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children
play areas, travel restrictions resulting in a limited number of tourists in France and the temporary
closures of a few restaurants in high-traffic travel locations. They were also partially offset by the
definitive closing or disposal of restaurants under the Quick brand over the period.

_Sales and franchise revenues_

Reported sales and franchise revenues increased by €83.9 million, or 61.0%, to €221.4 million
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €137.5 million for the six-month period ended June
30, 2020.

Restated sales and franchise revenues increased by €92.5 million, or 58.0%, to €251.9 million
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €159.4 million for the six-month period ended June
30, 2020, due to higher revenues results across all revenues sources.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the restated sales and franchise revenues of the
Group for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021.

5 — Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to reclassify the Quick activities falling within the scope
of the Quick Carve-Out as discontinued operations and include (c) depreciation and amortization related to assets held for
sale as if they had been maintained.

Company Restaurant revenues increased by €17.6 million, or 22.1%, to €97.1 million for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €79.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30,
2020. The net increase in Company Restaurant revenues was mainly due to the temporary closure of
all our Company Restaurants (under both the Burger King and Quick brands) between March 16, 2020
through the end of April 2020 and the rebound in activity from May 19, 2021 in connection with the
easing of the COVID-19 measures. In addition, such revenues increase was impacted by movements
in our network over the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021, including (i) the conversion of four
restaurants operated under the Quick brand and reopened under the Burger King brand with a higher
ARS, (ii) the transfer of two restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants operated under
the Quick brand to Company Restaurants and (iii) the higher share of Burger King restaurants with a
higher ARS compared to Quick restaurants.

As of June 30, 2020, we operated 88 Company Restaurants, of which 70 and 17 were operated
under the Burger King and Quick brands (including one temporarily closed for conversion into the
Burger King brand), respectively. As of June 30, 2021, we operated 79 Company Restaurants of which
69 and 10 were operated under the Burger King and Quick brands, respectively.

Franchise revenues increased by €43.2 million, or 63.2%, to €111.6 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021, from €68.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This
increase was mainly driven by the temporary closure of all our Franchise Restaurants (under both the
Burger King and Quick brands) between March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020; the rebound in
activity from May 19, 2021 in connection with the easing of the COVID-19 measures; the net increase
in the overall number of restaurants operated as Franchise Restaurants during the last twelve months
ended June 30, 2021; and the decrease in the temporary support provided to franchisees in line with
the increase in activity between 2020 and 2021. These positive effects were partially offset by the
persistence of some restrictive COVID-19 measures during the first half of 2021.

115


-----

At the end of June 2020, a total of 404 restaurants were operated as Franchise Restaurants,
of which 280 operated under the Burger King brand in France, 113 operated under the Quick brand in
France, seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and four were temporarily closed to be
converted as Burger King brand restaurants. During the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the
total number of Franchise Restaurants increased from 404 Franchise Restaurants at the end of June
2020 to 439 Franchise Restaurants at the end of June 2021, of which 330 operated under the Burger
King in France, 100 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand
in Morocco and two were temporarily closed restaurants to be converted into Burger King brand
restaurants.

Changes to our franchise network during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021 resulted
in an increase of our overall franchise network, reflecting an increase in the overall number of Franchise
Restaurants operated under the Burger King brand and a decrease in the overall number of Franchise
Restaurants operated under the Quick brand. These changes were driven by 31 restaurant openings
in France (of which 28 were under the Burger King brand and three were under the Quick brand); the
conversion of 17 Franchise Restaurants from Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants; the transfer
of 10 restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants (which reflected
five Burger King restaurants and five Quick restaurants); the transfer of two restaurants formerly
operated as Franchise Restaurants which operated under the Quick brand to Company Restaurants;
the disposal or definitive closing of four restaurants under the Quick brand in France and the temporary
closure of two restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand to be converted to the Burger King
brand.

Other income increased by €31.7 million, or 274.8%, to €43.2 million for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2021, from €11.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase
was primarily attributable to the increase in our property development activity and to the increase in
fees paid to us by third-party lessors as a direct consequence of the rebound of such activity following
the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.

_Cost of sales_

Reported cost of sales increased by €25.2 million, or 47.9%, to €77.8 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021, from €52.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

Restated cost of sales increased by €25.9 million, or 45.7%, to €82.6 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021, from €56.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This
increase was mainly attributable to an increase in food and other costs, which was partially offset by a
decrease in labor costs.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the restated cost of sales of the Group for the six
months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021.

-----

Company Restaurant food costs increased due to the temporary closure of all our restaurants
between March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020 and the rebound in activity from May 19, 2021
in connection with the easing of the COVID-19 measures. These effects were partly offset by the
decrease of nine Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants. Food costs
accounted for 27.1% of Company Restaurant revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021,
a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to 28.2% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.
This slight decrease is mainly attributable to better performance at the operational level over the 2021
period as compared to the same period in 2020 in relation to the easing of COVID-19 restrictive
measures, the launch of new offers with higher margins and a higher share of home delivery sales with
higher sales prices.

Labor costs decreased between the two periods, both in absolute terms and as a percentage
of Company Restaurant revenues. However, labor costs accounted for 28.1% of Company Restaurant
revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 7.4 percentage points compared
to 35.5% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This decrease in labor costs as a percentage
of Company Restaurant revenues was mainly due to social charge exemptions granted by the French
government during the first quarter of 2021, the higher share of home delivery sales with higher sales
prices, higher productivity and job subsidies.

Other costs increased over the period as a direct consequence of the increase in our property
development activity.

_Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_

Reported operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) for
continued activities increased by €1.3 million, or 7.9%, to €17.7 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2021, from €16.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

Restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased
by €4.0 million, or 7.6%, to €56.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €52.8
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mostly driven by an increase
in rental and other operating and occupancy costs, partly offset by a decrease in repair and maintenance
costs.

The following table shows our restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation
and amortization) for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021.

(1) Restated to exclude the impact of (a) the application of IFRS 16 — Leases (including IFRS IC), (b) the application of IFRS

5 — Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to reclassify the Quick activities falling within the scope
of the Quick Carve-Out as discontinued operations and include (c) depreciation and amortization related to assets held for
sale as if they had been maintained.

The decrease in repair and maintenance costs reflects the impact of cost reduction measures
following the slowdown in activity linked to the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the net decrease of nine
restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants.

117


-----

The increase in rental costs is mostly due to the net increase in the overall number of
restaurants over the period, with the addition of 26 restaurants during the twelve-month period ended
June 30, 2021, as well as the fact that in the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, three additional
restaurants were temporarily closed for conversion to Burger King restaurants compared to the prior
period, resulting in rental costs for such restaurants being booked as non-recurring expenses. Such
costs were partially offset by rebates granted by certain landlords following negotiations related to the
COVID-19 crisis.

The increase in other operating and occupancy costs is mainly attributable to the delivery fees
invoiced by aggregators.

_Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_

Reported depreciation and amortization (restaurants) for continued activities decreased by €0.5
million, or 1.4%, to €35.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €35.9 million for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

Restated depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €1.0 million, or 6.2%, to
€15.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €16.1 million for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2020.

_Selling costs_

Reported selling costs for continued activities increased by €6.8 million, or 68.7%, to €16.7
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €9.9 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2020.

Restated selling costs increased by €8.7 million or 65.9% to €21.9 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021, from €13.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

Franchisees under the Burger King and Quick brands contribute 3.5% of their sales and
between 4.5% and 5.0% of their sales, respectively, to a marketing budget to which we also contribute
the same percentage from our Company Restaurants sales.

The increase in selling costs over the period was primarily attributable to the increase in Burger
King's SWS by €180.8 million, or 56.0%; the increase in Quick's SWS by €13.2 million, or 13.1%; and
the temporary support provided during the first semester of 2021 to restaurants that provided a lower
than expected contribution rate to the marketing budget described above.

Selling costs as a percentage of SWS increased by 0.4 percentage points to 3.5% for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021, from 3.1% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This
increase was mainly due to the temporary support that was provided to the restaurants as described
above, partially offset by the increasing share of restaurants operated under the Burger King brand,
which have a lower rate of SWS dedicated to the marketing budget, within our total network of
restaurants.

_BK brand royalties_

Reported BK brand royalties for continued activities increased by €8.1 million, or 56.6%, to
€22.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €14.3 million for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2020.

118


-----

Restated BK brand royalties increased by €8.1 million, or 56.6%, to €22.4 million for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021, from €14.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.
This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in Burger King's SWS, including the additional
SWS generated by the 49 new Burger King restaurants opened between the two periods.

_Pre-opening costs_

Reported pre-opening costs for continued activities decreased by €0.1 million, or 25.0%, to €0.3
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €0.4 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2020.

Restated pre-opening costs decreased by €0.1 million, or 20.0%, to €0.4 million for the sixmonth periods ended June 30, 2021 from €0.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

_Other operating income/(expense)_

Reported other operating income for continued activities increased by €0.4 million, or 44.4%,
to €1.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €0.9 million for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2020.

Restated other operating income increased by €0.8 million, or 100.0%, to an income of €1.6
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €0.8 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2020.

_General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_

Reported general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) for
continued activities increased by €1.0 million, or 5.7%, to €18.5 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2021, from €17.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

Restated general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased
by €1.1 million, or 4.7%, to €24.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €23.3
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

This increase was mostly related to the impact of the temporary closures of all restaurants from
March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, leading to strong cost-reduction measures taken during
the six months ended June 30, 2020, certain of which continued, although at a reduced level, during
the six months ended June 30, 2021.

As a percentage of sales and franchise revenues, restated general and administrative costs
(excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by 4.9 percentage points to 9.7% for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021, from 14.6% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This decrease
as a percentage of sales and franchise revenues was mainly driven by the increase in revenues over
the two periods.

_Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_

Reported depreciation and amortization (corporate center) for continued activities increased by
€0.2 million, or 6.9%, to €3.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €2.9 million for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

119


-----

Restated depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly decreased by €0.1 million,
or 6.2%, to €1.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €1.6 million for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2020.

_Other corporate income and expenses_

Reported other corporate income and expenses for continued activities increased by €0.8
million, or 114.3%, to an expense of €0.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from
an income of €0.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated other corporate
income and expenses reflected the same figures.

_Other non-recurring income and expenses_

Reported other non-recurring expenses for continued activities decreased by €1.6 million, or
51.6%, to €1.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €3.1 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2020.

Restated other non-recurring expenses increased by €1.3 million, or 39.4%, to €4.6 million for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €3.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30,
2020. This increase was mainly due to costs associated with the legal carve-out of the Quick activities
booked during the second quarter of 2021. See “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial
_Information Presented—Changes in consolidation scope”._

_Net financial expense_

Reported net financial expenses for continued activities increased by €2.4 million, or 7.6%, to
€33.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €31.5 million for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2020.

Restated net financial expenses increase by €0.1 million to €20.1 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021 from €20.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

_Income tax_

Reported income tax for continued activities decreased by €1.2 million, or 171.4%, to an income
of €0.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from an expense of €0.7 million for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

Restated income tax decreased by €2.9 million, to an income of €0.7 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021, from an expense of €2.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30,
2020. The income tax booked for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was computed based on a
forecasted corporate income tax for the full year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a
provision on CVAE.

_Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_

Reported total share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method
remained fairly stable over the two periods, reflecting an amount near zero. Restated total share of
profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method reflected the same figures.

120


-----

_Net profit/(loss) for the period_

Reported net profit for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 increased by €45.4 million,
to a net profit of €3.6 million, from a net loss of €41.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30,
2020.

As a result of the foregoing factors, restated net profit for the six-month period ended June 30,
2021 increased by €47.3 million, to net profit of €4.4 million, from a net loss of €42.9 million for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2020.

_Total SWS ...................................................................._ **1,361.3** **1,081.8** **(279.5)** **(20.5)%**

SWS decreased by €279.5 million, or 20.5%, to €1,081.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from €1,361.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in
network sales was predominantly driven by COVID-19 related restrictions, including the temporary
closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, when restaurants
progressively reopened their drive-through windows, home delivery and takeaway services; limitations
on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play areas; travel restrictions resulting in a
limited number of tourists in France over the summer of 2020; and the temporary closures of a few
restaurants in high-traffic travel locations. This decrease was also due to the definitive closing or
disposal of restaurants under the Quick brand during the course of 2020. The decrease in sales was
partially offset by the development of new sales channels, such as delivery and Click & Collect options.

_Sales and franchise revenues_

Reported sales and franchise revenues decreased by €126.1 million, or 25.7%, to
€364.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €490.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

Restated sales and franchise revenues decreased by €168.7 million, or 28.7%, to
€419.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €587.7 million for the year ended

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the restated sales and franchise revenues of the
Group for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

Company Restaurant revenues decreased by €129.8 million, or 40.1%, to €194.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from €323.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This

122


-----

decrease was largely driven by the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through
the end of April 2020, as well as subsequent limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and
children play areas due to COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, the decrease was also attributed to
changes in our store network, including: the transfer of three restaurants formerly operated as Company
Restaurants (of which two were operated under the Burger King brand and one was operated under
the Quick brand) to franchise restaurants; the temporary closure of three Quick restaurants for
conversion to the Burger King brand; and the disposal or definitive closure of one Company Restaurant
operated under the Quick brand. These network changes were partially offset by (a) the opening of one
new Company Restaurant under the Burger King brand, (b) the conversion of four restaurants formerly
operated under the Quick brand, which generated higher ARS once reopened under the Burger King
brand, (c) the transfer of two restaurants formerly operated as franchise restaurants to Company
Restaurants under the Quick brand, (d) the higher share of Burger King restaurants, which generate a
higher ARS compared to Quick restaurants, and (e) the stronger performance and positive like-for-like
sales by Company Restaurants under the Quick brand for the twelve-month period before the COVID19 crisis, as compared to the corresponding period of 2019.

Franchise revenues decreased by €35.0 million, or 16.0%, to €183.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from €218.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was
largely driven by the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April
2020, as well as subsequent limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play
areas due to COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, as a result of decreased activity due to COVID-19
impacts, the Group provided temporary support to franchises with lower brand and lease management
rates during the last three quarters of 2020. These effects were partially offset by the net increase in
the overall number of restaurants that were operated as franchised restaurants during the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in franchise revenues over this period was less than
the decrease in revenues recorded for our Company Restaurants largely due to (i) the development of
our network, pursuant to which we opened more Franchise Restaurants than Company Restaurants
during the period and (ii) the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 restrictions on our Company
Restaurants, many of which are located in malls or commercial shopping centers, which experienced
shutdowns over the period.

At the end of December 2019, a total of 397 restaurants were operated as Franchise
Restaurants, of which 270 operated under the Burger King brand in France, 119 operated under the
Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and one was temporarily
closed to be converted as Burger King brand restaurants. During the last twelve months ended
December 31, 2020, the total number of Franchise Restaurants increased from 397 Franchise
Restaurants at the end of December 2019 to 422 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2020,
of which 300 operated under the Burger King in France, 108 operated under the Quick brand in France,
seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and seven were temporarily closed restaurants to
be converted as Burger King brand restaurants.

Changes to our franchise network during the last twelve months ended December 31, 2020
resulted in an increase of our overall franchise network, reflecting an increase in the overall number of
Franchise Restaurants operated under the Burger King brand and a decrease in the overall number of
Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand. These changes were driven by 20 restaurant
openings in France (of which 19 were under the Burger King brand and one was under the Quick brand),
as well as the transfer of 11 restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise
Restaurants (which reflected six Burger King restaurants and five Quick restaurants). These increases
in the number of franchised restaurants were partially offset by the transfer of two restaurants formerly
operated as Franchise Restaurants which operated under the Quick brand to Company Restaurants,
the disposal or definitive closing of four restaurants under the Quick brand in France and the conversion
of five Franchise Restaurants from Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants, of which one was
temporary closed to be converted at the end of December 2019.

In addition, almost all of the 19 new Franchise Restaurants opened under or converted to the
Burger King brand, as well as transferred from Company Restaurants, were operated under Franchise
with Lease arrangements, which generate lease payments as a percentage of sales, contributing to

123


-----

franchise revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. However, this was partially
offset by the effect of the temporary closures necessary to implement the conversion process.

Other revenues decreased by €3.9 million, or 8.6%, to €41.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 from €45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was
largely attributable to the decrease of fees paid by Quick brand-related partners as the direct
consequence of the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April
2020, as well as subsequent limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play
areas and a limited number of tourists in France over the summer of 2020 due to COVID-19 restaurant
and travel restrictions. The decrease is also the direct consequence of outsourcing the Quick dedicated
logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the
Burger King brand.

_Cost of sales_

Reported cost of sales decreased by €50.1 million, or 27.5%, to €131.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from €181.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Restated cost of sales decreased by €76.8 million, or 35.3%, to €140.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from €217.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the restated cost of sales of the Group for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

Other costs ................................................................... (25.3) (23.7) 1.6 (6.3)%

of the Quick Carve-Out as discontinued operations and include for 2020 (c) depreciation and amortization related to assets
held for sale as if they had been maintained.

The decrease in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the decrease in food and labor costs
for Company Restaurants, which decreased by €37.0 million, or 40.5%, and €38.1 million, or 37.8%,
respectively.

Company Restaurant cost of sales, including food costs and labor costs, primarily decreased
due to the temporary closure of all our restaurants between March 16, 2020 through the end of April
2020, lower activity in the fourth quarter in relation to the COVID-19 crisis and the decrease of nine
Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants.

As a percentage of Company Restaurants revenues, food costs slightly decreased by 0.2
percentage points to 28.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 28.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2019. This slight decrease is mainly attributable to better performance at the
operational level, the launch of new offers with higher margins and a higher share of home delivery
sales with higher sales prices.

As a percentage of Company Restaurant revenues, labor costs increased by 1.2 percentage
points to 32.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 31.1% for the year ended

124


-----

December 31, 2019. This increase between the two periods is mostly due to the temporary closure of
restaurants during the first half of 2020 which translated into lower productivity for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

Other costs decreased by €1.6 million to €23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
from €25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as the direct consequence of outsourcing the
Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model
applied to the Burger King brand. This decrease was partially offset by the transfer of the property
development expenses generated during the first three quarters of 2020 from "Other operating income
and expenses" to "Other costs" in accordance with IFRS 15.

_Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_

Reported operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased
by €12.3 million, or 27.5%, to €32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €44.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased
by €12.0 million, or 10.5%, to €102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €114.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(1) Restated to exclude the impact of (a) the application of IFRS 16 — Leases (including IFRS IC), (b) the application of IFRS

5 — Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to reclassify the Quick activities falling within the scope
of the Quick Carve-Out as discontinued operations and include 2020 (c) depreciation and amortization related to assets held
for sale as if they had been maintained.

The decrease in repair and maintenance costs and utility costs reflect the impact of cost
reduction measures implemented after the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020
and the decrease of nine Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants.
Such decreases were partly offset by the decreasing share of franchise restaurants operated under
Pure Franchise arrangements.

The decrease in rental costs is mostly due to rebates obtained from landlords following
negotiations related to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the fact that several restaurants formerly
operated under the Quick brand were temporarily closed to be converted into the Burger King brand,
which resulted in rental costs for such restaurants being booked as non-recurring expenses. Such
decreases were partly offset by the net increase of 16 restaurants in the overall number of restaurants
during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020.

_Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_

Reported depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €1.6 million, or 2.2%, to
€71.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €73.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

Restated depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €2.1 million, or 6.1%, to
€32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €34.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization
generated by restaurants disposed or definitively closed during the period and capital expenditure
disposals in connection with disposals of fixtures to landholders in 2019. This decrease was partly offset
by depreciation and amortization generated by new openings or conversions.

_Selling costs_

Reported selling costs decreased by €10.6 million, or 27.3%, to an expense of €28.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €38.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2019.

Restated selling costs decreased by €17.7 million, or 33.3%, to an expense of €35.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from expenses of €53.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in Burger King’s SWS by €170.8 million,
or 17.0%, and the decrease in Quick's SWS by €108.8 million, or 30.3%.

Selling costs as a percentage of SWS decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 3.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2020, from 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was
mainly the consequence of the cancellation of marketing campaigns during the temporary closures of
all restaurants beginning on March 16, 2020 and the increasing share of restaurants operated under
the Burger King brand within the total network with a lower rate of SWS dedicated to the marketing
budget.

_BK brand royalties_

Reported BK brand royalties decreased by €2.5 million, or 6.6%, to €35.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 from €37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated BK
brand royalties reflected the same figures. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease of
SWS under the Burger King brand between the two periods, which was partially offset by the increase
of brand fees rates invoiced by Burger King Corporation as the Group benefited from discounted brand
fee rates in the year ended December 31, 2019 for all restaurants converted before such date. Since
January 1, 2020, the stabilized brand rate (4.5%) has been applied for converted restaurants.

_Pre-opening costs_

Reported pre-opening costs slightly increased by €0.1 million, or 25.0%, to €0.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from €0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Restated pre-opening costs slightly increased by €0.1 million, or 14.3%, to €0.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Other operating income/(expense)_

Reported other operating income decreased by €5.9 million, or 35.3%, to an income of
€10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an income of €16.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

126


-----

Restated other operating income decreased by €6.1 million, or 36.1%, to an income of
€10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an income of €16.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to a lower volume of real estate transactions
effectuated in the ordinary course of our business in 2020 than in 2019, partly offset by the benefit of
business interruption compensation from various stakeholders related to full or partial restaurant
closures, which occurred during the second and fourth quarters of 2020.

_General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_

Reported general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)
decreased by €4.1 million, or 10.2%, to €36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from
€40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Restated general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased
by €4.5 million, or 8.7%, to €47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €51.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly due to the impact of cost reduction
measures implemented after the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020. As a
percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)
increased by 2.5 percentage points to 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 8.8% for the
year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly related to the decrease in revenues in 2020
due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the decrease in revenues following the outsourcing of the
Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model
applied to the Burger King brand.

_Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_

Reported depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly decreased by €0.3 million,
or 5.1%, to €5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €5.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

Restated depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly increased by €0.1 million, or
3.1%, to €3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €3.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

_Other corporate income and expenses_

Reported other corporate expenses increased by €2.7 million to an expense of €1.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from an income of €1.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. Restated other corporate income and expenses reflected the same figures. This increase is
principally due to compensation granted by the Group in 2020 to partners in relation to the
consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.

_Other non-recurring income and expenses_

Reported other non-recurring expenses decreased by €6.5 million to an expense of
€12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €19.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

Restated other non-recurring expenses decreased by €7.7 million to an expense of
€13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €20.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly attributable to the settlement of a litigation with
a former international franchisee, which had a negative impact on our consolidated results during the
year ended December 31, 2019, as well as the decrease in the write-off of assets following the definitive
closing of certain Quick restaurants. These effects were partly offset by the reversal of depreciation
related to impairment of assets booked in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an increase in
depreciation related to impairment of assets booked in the fourth quarter of 2020.

127


-----

_Net financial income/(expense)_

Reported net financial expense increased by €3.4 million to an expense of €65.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €62.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019.

Restated net financial expense decreased by €1.0 million to an expense of €40.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €41.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019.

_Income tax_

Reported income tax decreased by €3.1 million, or 1,550.0%, to an income of €2.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €0.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019.

Restated income tax decreased by €8.7 million, or 56.1%, to an expense of €6.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €15.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. This decrease is principally due to income tax payments made in the fourth quarter of 2019 to
authorities in Belgium in preparation for the Quick Carve-Out.

_Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_

Reported share of loss of companies consolidated using the equity method increased by €0.1
million from an income of €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to a nearly zero expense
for the year ended December 31, 2020. Restated share of (loss) of companies consolidated using the
equity method reflected the same figures.

_Net profit/(loss) for the period_

Reported net loss for the period increased by €37.1 million to a net loss of €29.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from net profit of €8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

As a result of the foregoing factors, restated net loss for the period increased by €44.8 million
to a net loss of €29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from net profit of €15.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019.

_SWS_

**For the year ended**

**December 31,**
**2018** **2019** **change** **% change**
**(€ in millions, except percentages)**
SWS ............................................................................. 1,216.2 1,361.3 145.1 11.9%
_Of which Burger King ...................................................._ 775.0 1,002.7 227.7 29.4%
_Of which Quick.............................................................._ 441.2 358.6 (82.6) (18.7)%

SWS increased by €145.1 million, or 11.9%, to €1,361.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from €1,216.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in
network sales was predominantly driven by the significant growth of the Burger King restaurant network
during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting 51 newly opened or converted restaurants, and
the higher ARS of Burger King restaurants, generally.

128


-----

This growth in SWS was partially offset by the negative impact of the closing of one Burger
King restaurant during the fourth quarter of 2019 due to its relocation, as well as the changes in the size
of the Quick network, namely as a result of: (a) a net reduction of 33 restaurants in mainland France
(including one Quick restaurant opening after relocation during the first quarter of 2019) due to their
conversion into Burger King restaurants, their disposal or their definitive closure and (b) the definitive
closing of two Quick restaurants in the French departments of la Guadeloupe and la Martinique, which
in turn was offset by two restaurant openings in the second half of 2019.

SWS growth was further offset by the lower ARS of Quick restaurants, generally, although this
effect was itself mitigated by a positive performance for conventional Quick restaurants during the year
ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a growth of 4.5% for the first quarter, 6.5% for the second quarter,
8.2% for the third quarter and 10.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019.

_Results of operations_

The following table sets forth the consolidated results of operations of the Group for the years

_Sales and franchise revenues_

Reported sales and franchise revenues decreased by €37.6 million, or 7.1%, to €490.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €528.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Restated sales and franchise revenues decreased by €65.8 million, or 10.1%, to €587.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €653.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the restated sales and franchise revenues of the
Group for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 .

5 — Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to reclassify the Quick activities falling within the scope
of the Quick Carve-Out as discontinued operations.

Company Restaurant restated revenues decreased by €32.4 million, or 9.1%, to €323.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €356.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
decrease was mainly due to the transfer of 27 restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants
to Franchise Restaurants (which reflected 18 Burger King restaurants and nine Quick restaurants), and
the disposal or definitive closing of one Company Restaurant operated under the Burger King brand
due to its relocation and the disposal or definitive closing of five Company Restaurants operated under
the Quick brand. These network changes were partially offset by two new Company Restaurant
openings under the Burger King brand; one new Company Restaurant opening under the Quick brand
(after its relocation); the conversion of six restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand and
reopened under the Burger King brand, with a higher ARS; the transfer of nine restaurants formerly
operated as Franchise Restaurants to Company Restaurants (eight of which were under the Burger
King Brand and one under the Quick brand); the higher share of Burger King restaurants, which
generate a higher ARS compared to Quick restaurants (approximately 77% of Company Restaurants
revenues as of December 31, 2019, compared to 64% as of the year prior); and the stronger
performance and positive like-for-like sales by Company Restaurants under the Quick brand for the
twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year prior.

130


-----

Franchise restated revenues increased by €45.6 million, or 26.4%, to €218.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from €172.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was largely attributable to a change in our network with a larger contribution of Franchise Restaurants
under the Burger King brand within the network as of December 31, 2019. Each such restaurant
generated higher revenues due to the higher ARS per restaurant, as well as the higher royalty and
marketing fee rates as compared to Quick restaurants.

At the end of December 2018, a total of 364 restaurants were operated as Franchise
Restaurants, of which 217 operated under the Burger King brand in France, 137 operated under the
Quick brand in France, seven operated international under the Quick brand (five and two in Morocco
and the West Indies, respectively) and three were temporarily closed to be converted as Burger King
brand restaurants. During the last twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the total number of
Franchise Restaurants increased from 364 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2018 to 397
Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2019, of which 270 operated under the Burger King
brand in France, 119 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand
in Morocco and one was temporarily closed to be converted as Burger King brand restaurants.

Changes to our franchise network during the last twelve months ended December 31, 2020
resulted in an increase of our overall franchise network, reflecting an increase in the overall number of
Franchise Restaurants operated under the Burger King brand and a decrease in the overall number of
Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand.

The increase in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants in our network operated under
the Burger King brand by 53 restaurants was primarily due to the conversion of 23 restaurants from the
Quick brand, the opening of 20 new restaurants and the transfer of 18 Burger King brand restaurants
formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants. These increases were partly
offset by the transfer of eight restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants to Company
Restaurants.

The decrease in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants in our network operated under
the Quick brand by 20 restaurants was primarily due the conversion of 23 restaurants from the Quick
brand to the Burger King brand and the disposal or definitive closure of five Franchise Restaurants.
These changes were partly offset by the transfer of eight Quick brand restaurants formerly operated as
Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants.

In addition, almost all of the 53 new Franchise Restaurants opened under or converted to the
Burger King brand, as well as transferred from Company Restaurants, were operated under Franchise
with Lease arrangements, which generate lease payments as a percentage of sales, contributing to
franchise revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. However, this was partially
offset by the effect of the temporary closures necessary to implement the conversion process.

Other restated revenues decreased by €79.0 million, or 63.4%, to €45.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from €124.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease
is mainly attributable to the decrease in sales of the Quick dedicated logistics services to Quick
franchisees, which was a direct consequence of outsourcing the Quick dedicated logistics activity in
February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand.
This decrease was also related to the net decrease in the overall number of Quick restaurants operated
as franchise restaurants prior to the outsourcing, such that the decrease in other revenues corresponds
to the decrease in the Quick franchise restaurants.

_Cost of sales_

Reported cost of sales decreased by €65.5 million, or 26.5%, to €181.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from €247.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

131


-----

Restated cost of sales decreased by €97.8 million, or 31.0%, to €217.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from €315.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of the restated cost of sales of the Group for the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019.

5 — Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to reclassify the Quick activities falling within the scope

As a percentage of Company Restaurants revenues, food costs decreased by 1.1 percentage
point to 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 29.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to better performance at the operational level,
the launch of new offers with higher margins and lower logistics costs as a greater share of raw materials
were sourced in France.

As a percentage of Company Restaurant revenues, labor costs decreased by 1.4 percentage
points to 31.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 32.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease is due to an improvement in productivity for both the Burger King
and Quick brands.

Quick-dedicated logistics purchases for franchisees decreased by €70.1 million, or 73.5%, to
€25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €95.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in Quick dedicated logistics
purchases as a result of outsourcing the Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new
logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand.

_Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_

Reported operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased
by €49.5 million, or 52.5%, to €44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €94.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased
by €3.6 million, or 3.2%, to €114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €110.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018.

5 — Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations to reclassify the Quick activities falling within the scope
of the Quick Carve-Out as discontinued operations.

The decrease in repair and maintenance costs, utility costs and other operating and occupancy
costs reflect the decrease of 21 Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company
Restaurants. Such decreases were partly offset by the decreasing share of franchise restaurants
operated under Pure Franchise arrangements.

The increase in rental costs is mostly due to the net increase of 12 restaurants in the overall
number of restaurants during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019 and the fact that
several restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand were temporarily closed to be converted
into the Burger King brand, which resulted in rental costs for such restaurants being booked as nonrecurring expenses.

_Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_

Reported depreciation and amortization (restaurants) increased by €42.9 million, or 141.1%, to
€73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €30.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

Restated depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €1.0 million, or 2.8%, to
€34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €35.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization
generated by restaurants disposed or definitively closed during the period and capital expenditure
disposals in connection with disposals of fixtures to landholders in 2019. This decrease was partly offset
by depreciation and amortization generated by new openings or conversions.

_Selling costs_

Reported selling costs increased by €3.1 million, or 8.7%, to an expense of €38.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €35.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2018.

Restated selling costs increased by €1.4 million, or 2.7%, to an expense of €53.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €51.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in Burger King’s SWS by €227.7 million, or
29.4%. Selling costs as a percentage of SWS decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 3.9% for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was

133


-----

mainly the consequence of the increasing share of restaurants operated under the Burger King brand
within the total network with a lower rate of SWS dedicated to the marketing budget.

_BK brand royalties_

Reported BK brand royalties increased by €8.7 million, or 29.8%, to €37.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from €29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated BK
brand royalties reflected the same figures. This increase is primarily attributable to the growth of the
total number of Burger King restaurants in our network by 50 restaurants.

_Pre-opening costs_

Reported pre-opening costs decreased by €1.6 million, or 80.0%, to €0.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Restated pre-opening costs decreased by €1.3 million, or 65.0%, to €0.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was
mainly due to the decrease in Company Restaurant openings during the 2019 compared to the year
prior.

_Other operating income/(expense)_

Reported other operating income increased by €5.6 million, or 50.5%, to an income of
€16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €11.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

Restated other operating income increased by €4.2 million, or 33.1%, to an income of
€16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €12.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to a higher volume of real estate transactions
effectuated in the ordinary course of our business in 2019 than in 2018.

_General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_

Reported general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased
by €0.3 million, or 0.8%, to €40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €40.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018.

Restated general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased
by €3.7 million, or 7.7%, to €51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €48.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs
(excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by 1.4 percentage points to 8.8% for the year
ended December 31, 2019 from 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is mainly
related to the decrease in revenues following the outsourcing of the Quick dedicated logistics activity in
February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand.

_Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_

Reported depreciation and amortization (corporate center) increased by €2.1 million, or 55.3%,
to €5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €3.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

Restated depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly decreased by €0.6 million,
or 15.8%, to €3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €3.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

134


-----

_Other corporate income and expenses_

Reported other corporate income decreased by €1.0 million, or 38.5%, to an income of
€1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €2.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

Restated other corporate income decreased by €1.0 million, or 38.5%, to an income of
€1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €2.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

_Other non-recurring income and expenses_

Reported other non-recurring expenses decreased by €12.2 million to an expense of
€19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €31.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

Restated other non-recurring expenses decreased by €10.9 million to an expense of
€20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €31.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly attributable to the reversal of depreciation related
to impairment of assets booked in the fourth quarter of 2019, principally for Company Restaurants, as
well as fewer conversions of Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, resulting in fewer write-offs of
Quick's assets than in the year prior. These effects were partially offset by the settlement of a litigation
with a former international franchisee, which had a negative impact on our consolidated results during
the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Net financial income/(expense)_

Reported net financial expense increased by €21.7 million, or 53.6%, to an expense of
€62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an expense of €40.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

Restated net financial expense increased by €0.7 million, or 1.7%, to an expense of
€41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an expense of €40.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

_Income tax_

Reported income tax decreased by €1.8 million, or 90.0%, to an expense of €0.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Restated income tax increased by €9.2 million to an expense of €15.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 from an expense of €6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
increase is principally due to income tax payments made in the fourth quarter of 2019 to authorities in
Belgium in preparation for the Quick Carve-Out.

_Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_

Reported share of profit of companies consolidated using the equity method increased by €0.2
million to an income of €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an expense of €0.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated share of profit of companies consolidated using
the equity method reflected the same figures.

135


-----

_Net profit/(loss) for the period_

Reported net loss for the period decreased by €14.7 million to net profit of €8.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from net loss of €6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

As a result of the foregoing factors, restated net loss for the period increased by €21.8 million
to net profit of €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from net loss of €6.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Group**

Our cash requirements consist mainly of the following:

    - operating activities, including our working capital expenditure requirements;

    - servicing our indebtedness; and

    - funding capital expenditures, particularly restaurant conversions and new restaurant
openings, including the intendent equipment and fixtures purchases and pre-opening costs.

**_Liquidity and Capital Resources_**

Our primary sources of liquidity consist of the following:

    - cash generated from our operating activities;

    - the proceeds from the Notes offered hereby;

    - financial leases for equipment and fixtures; and

    - drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

On an as-adjusted basis for the Refinancing, the consolidated net debt of the SSN Issuer and
NewCo GB as of August 31, 2021 would have been €1,075.1 million and we would have had cash and
cash equivalents of €60.1 million (assuming the New Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn during the
entire period) as of August 31, 2021.

The PIK Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating operations or assets of its
own except for the equity interest it holds in its subsidiaries and any rights in intercompany receivables
owed by its subsidiaries. As a result, the PIK Issuer depends and will depend on the cash flow of its
subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the PIK Notes. The PIK Issuer’s ability
to pay cash interest on the PIK Notes offered hereby will be determined by its cash available for debt
service. See “Description of the PIK Notes—Terms of the PIK Notes.”

The Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain covenants that,
among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional
indebtedness; pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other
restricted payments or investments; enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted
subsidiaries; sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; enter
into transactions with affiliates; create or incur liens; and merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of
our assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.

Cash generated/(used) by operating activities

Reported cash generated/(used) by operating activities was recorded as an inflow of €84.5
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 (as compared to an inflow of €29.1 million for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2020).

Restated cash generated/(used) by operating activities was recorded as an inflow of €46.4
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 (as compared to an outflow of €6.7 million for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2020). This inflow was primarily attributable to an inflow related to
EBITDA, partly offset by outflows for non-recurring items, mainly related to pre-conversion costs
incurred during the temporary closure of restaurants (principally comprising labor, training and rent) and
net post-closure costs (including exit indemnities as applicable) incurred due to the definitive closures
of Quick brand restaurants, and an outflow for income tax paid during the quarter (mainly CVAE).

Cash generated/(used) by investment activities

Reported cash generated/(used) by investment activities was recorded as a cash outflow of
€27.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 (as compared to an outflow of €11.2 million
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020).

Restated cash generated/(used) by investment activities for the six-month period ended June
30, 2021 was recorded as a cash outflow of €27.2 million as compared to a cash outflow of €11.2 million
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. The net cash outflow from investment activities for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to (i) the acquisition of business goodwill and
of the shares of three companies operating Burger King restaurants; (ii) investments for the completed
conversions of 15 Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and two additional Quick restaurants
which were temporarily closed for conversion as of June 30, 2021; (iii) investments in new restaurant
openings, consisting of 15 Burger King restaurants and two Quick restaurants opened during the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021; (iv) cash outflows related to restaurant refurbishments; and (v)
additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures and network management
activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants
and vice versa). This cash outflow was partially offset by asset disposals of restaurants transferred from
Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants under both the Burger King and Quick brands in the
six months ended June 30, 2021.

The net cash outflow from investment activities for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020
was primarily due to (i) investments in new restaurants openings consisting of seven Burger King
restaurants and one Quick restaurant; to (ii) investments for the completed conversions of 10 Quick
restaurants to Burger King restaurants and an additional five Quick restaurants temporarily closed for
conversion as of June 30, 2020; (iii) cash outflows related to Quick restaurant refurbishments; and (iv)

139


-----

additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures and network management
activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants
and vice versa). This cash outflow was partially offset by significant disposal gains mainly related to our
real estate activity during the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Cash generated/(used) by financing activities

Reported cash generated/(used) by financing activities was recorded as a cash outflow of €58.8
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a cash inflow of €43.7 million for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2020.

Restated cash generated/(used) by financing activities was recorded as a cash outflow of €20.7
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a cash inflow of €79.5 million for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This outflow for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021
was mainly related to (i) an outflow of €19.1 million related to the payment of interests (consisting
primarily of accrued interests of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes); and
(ii) €12.2 million of borrowing redemption. This outflow was partially offset by an inflow of €10.6 million
corresponding to a new bilateral borrowing entered into during the second quarter of 2021.

The €79.5 million cash inflow recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 was
principally related to an inflow of €145.0 million of new borrowings consisting in the full draw of the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility for €60.0 million, €5.0 million of new borrowing which occurred during
the first quarter of 2020 and €80.0 million of a state guaranteed loan fully funded on June 18, 2020.
This inflow was partially offset by an outflow of €47.1 million mainly due to a €40.0 million repayment of
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility which occurred on June 29, 2020, as well as an outflow of €18.4
million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests of our Existing Fixed
Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes).

Cash generated/(used) by operating activities

Reported cash generated/(used) by operating activities was recorded as an inflow of
€109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an inflow €156.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019.

Restated cash generated/(used) by operating activities was recorded as an inflow of
€36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an inflow €87.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the €36.6 million inflow was
primarily attributable to an inflow related to EBITDA, partly offset by outflows for non-recurring items,
mainly related to pre-conversion costs incurred during the temporary closure of restaurants (principally
comprising labor, training and rent) and net post-closure costs (including exit indemnities as applicable)
incurred due to the definitive closures of Quick brand restaurants, and an outflow for income tax paid
during the quarter (mainly CVAE).

Cash generated/(used) by investment activities

Reported cash generated/(used) by investment activities for the year ended December 31,
2020 was recorded as a cash outflow of €32.8 million as compared to a cash outflow of €5.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated cash generated/(used) by investment activities reflected
the same figures. The net cash outflow from investment activities for the year ended December 31,
2020 was primarily due to (i) investments for the completed conversions of nine Quick restaurants to
Burger King restaurants and seven additional Quick restaurants which were temporarily closed for
conversion as of December 31, 2020; (ii) investments in new restaurant openings, consisting of 20
Burger King restaurants and one Quick restaurants opened during the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2020; (iii) cash outflows related to restaurant refurbishments; and (iv) additional cash
outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures and network management activities (namely,
costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa).
This cash outflow was partially offset by asset disposals mainly related to (i) real estate activity and (ii)
asset disposals of restaurants transferred from Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants under
both the Burger King and Quick brands in the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

The net cash outflow from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was
primarily due to asset disposals, partly offset by (i) investments in new restaurants openings consisting
of 22 Burger King restaurants and three Quick restaurants; to (ii) investments for the completed
conversions of 29 Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and an additional Quick restaurant
temporarily closed for conversion as of December 31, 2019; (iii) cash outflows related to Quick
restaurant refurbishments; and (iv) additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures
and network management activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants
into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa).

Cash generated/(used) by financing activities

Reported cash generated/(used) by financing activities were recorded as a cash outflow of
€13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a cash outflow of €107.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Restated cash generated/(used) by financing activities were recorded as a cash inflow of
€59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a cash outflow of €38.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. The €59.2 million inflow for the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2020 was mainly related to an inflow of €145.0 million of new borrowings consisting in
the full draw of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility for €60.0 million, €5.0 million of new borrowing
which occurred during the first quarter of 2020 and €80.0 million of a state guaranteed loan fully funded
on June 18, 2020. This inflow was partly offset by an outflow of €85.9 million mainly due to (i) a €40.0

million repayment of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility which occurred on June 29, 2020; (ii) a €9.1
million redemption of borrowings and lease debt; (iii) an outflow of €36.8 million related to the payment
of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing
Floating Rate Notes).

The €38.1 million outflow for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019 was mainly
related to (i) €39.4 million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests
of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes) and to the closing of the litigation
with a former international Quick franchisee; (ii) €9.0 million repayment of borrowings and lease debt;
(iii) €7.2 million of dividends paid by the SSN Issuer to allow NewCo GB to pay its interest payments in

payments in cash. These outflows were partly offset by €18.3 million in new borrowings.

Cash generated/(used) by operating activities

Cash generated/(used) by operating activities was recorded as an inflow of €87.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to €49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This inflow was primarily attributable to an inflow related to EBITDA, partly offset by outflows for nonrecurring items, mainly related to the closing of the litigation with a former international Quick franchisee,
pre-conversion costs incurred during the temporary closure of restaurants (principally comprising labor,
training and rent) and net post-closure costs (including exit indemnities as applicable) incurred due to
the definitive closures of Quick brand restaurants, and an outflow for income tax paid during the quarter
(mainly taxes paid to authorities in Belgium as a result of the Quick Carve-Out as well as CVAE.

Cash generated/(used) by investment activities

Cash generated/(used) by investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was
recorded as a cash outflow of €5.0 million as compared to a cash outflow of €74.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

142


-----

The net cash outflow from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was
primarily due to asset disposals, partly offset by (i) investments in new restaurants openings consisting
of 22 Burger King restaurants and three Quick restaurants; to (ii) investments for the completed
conversions of 29 Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and an additional Quick restaurant
temporarily closed for conversion as of December 31, 2019; (iii) cash outflows related to Quick
restaurant refurbishments; and (iv) additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures
and network management activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants
into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa).

The net cash outflow from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, and
excluding the acquisition of the investment vehicles which occurred during this year, was primarily due
to (i) investments for the completed conversions of 63 Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and
six additional Quick restaurants which were temporarily closed for conversion as of December 31, 2018;
(ii) investments in new restaurant openings, consisting of 24 Burger King restaurants; (iii) cash outflows
related to Quick halal protein restaurants' refurbishments; and (iv) additional cash outflows related to
maintenance capital expenditures and network management activities (namely, costs related to the
conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa).

Cash generated/(used) by financing activities

Cash generated/(used) by financing activities was recorded as a cash outflow of €38.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to a cash outflow of €42.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

The €38.1 million outflow for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019 was mainly
related to (i) €39.4 million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests
of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes) and to the closing of the litigation
with a former international Quick franchisee; (ii) €9.0 million repayment of borrowings and lease debt;
(iii) €7.2 million of dividends paid by the SSN Issuer to allow NewCo GB to pay its interest payments in
cash; and (iv) €0.9 million capital decrease paid by the SSN Issuer to allow NewCo GB to pay its interest
payments in cash. These outflows were partly offset by €18.3 million in new bilateral borrowings.

The €42.5 million outflow for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018 was mainly
related to (i) €38.4 million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests
of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes); and to (ii) €15.7 million repayment
of borrowings. These outflows were partly offset by new borrowings for €11.6 million (mainly related to
a CICE (Crédit Impôt pour la Compétitivité et l'Emploi) financing).

**_Working capital_**

Our primary source of trade receivables are (i) royalties and lease and business assets
payments due from franchisees and (ii) payments due from lessors in connection with our CPI activity.
On the other hand, our primary source of trade payables consisted of (i) investment-related payables
(for restaurant openings and conversions), (ii) payables related to our CPI activity and (iii) food costs.
Within food costs, we purchase raw materials and food products only for Company Restaurants. Since
the end of the first quarter ended March 31, 2019, Franchise Restaurants under both the Burger King
and Quick brands are responsible for their own food and logistics costs as the food purchase and
logistics have since been outsourced to a third-party company. The other elements of our operating
working capital inflows consist of labor costs and, for the Burger King brand, payments due to BK
Europe which are generally paid following the close of the applicable month. Cash outflows related to
operating working capital include royalty payments due from franchisees and lease payments, the
majority of which are pre-payable on a quarterly basis.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Over the periods under review, our capital expenditure was divided into the following
categories:

    - **Capital expenditures for new restaurant openings: includes expenses incurred related**
to new restaurant openings, such as transaction costs related to securing leaseholds,
purchase and installation of new fixtures, purchase and installation of internal furnishings
and exterior signage, and groundwork related to drive-throughs and parking (as applicable)
for Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants (where
costs are shared with the franchisee), net of disposals (as applicable);

    - **Capital expenditures for restaurant conversions: includes expenses incurred related to**
the conversion of existing Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants, such as transaction
costs related to renegotiating leaseholds, purchase and installation of new fixtures,
purchase and installation of internal furnishings and exterior signage, and groundwork
related to drive-throughs and parking (as applicable) for Company Restaurants and
Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants (where costs are shared with the
franchisee), net of disposals (as applicable);

    - **Maintenance capital expenditures:** includes investments to maintain, refurbish and/or
replace obsolescent assets and equipment, including for furniture for restaurant interiors,
point-of-sale terminals and signage, net of disposals (as applicable); and

    - **Other capital expenditures:** includes mainly (i) expenses incurred related to network
management (namely, the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants
and vice versa), including the purchase of intangible assets, such as business assets rights
(“fonds de commerce”), tangible assets owned by the former franchisee and financial
assets, such as shares of former franchisee companies, net of disposals; and (ii) IT and
digital investments, as well as certain marketing and new menu offering capital
expenditures, net of disposals.

We estimate that our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 will be
approximately €43 million, most of which will consist of capital expenditures for restaurant conversions
and new restaurant openings. Such capital expenditures are expected to remain relatively low due to
limited planned restaurant conversions and the continued implementation of our asset-light strategy for
new restaurant openings. Maintenance capital expenditures will increase in line with the size of the
network.

Capital expenditures for new restaurant openings decreased by €0.7 million, or 14%, to €3.7
million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €4.3 million for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2020, largely as a result of the higher share of new restaurant openings under our asset-light
model.

Capital expenditures for restaurant conversions increased by €5.4 million to €10.4 million for
the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €5.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30,
2020. This expenditure was primarily related to (i) the completed conversion of 15 Quick restaurants to
Burger King restaurants (of which one was a Company Restaurant and 14 were Franchises with Lease
Management restaurants); and (ii) the conversion of two additional Quick restaurants which were
temporarily closed for conversion as of June 30, 2021. Further, a majority of the planned conversions
for the year 2021 were implemented in the first half of the year. For the six-month period ended June
30, 2020, three Quick restaurants were converted to Burger King restaurants and five additional
restaurants were under conversion.

Maintenance capital expenditures increased by €2.3 million to €6.1 million for the six-month
period ended June 30, 2021, from €3.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This
increase is principally due to the fact that part of the conversion process involves a full refurbishment of
former Quick restaurants and the resulting good state of repair of the relatively new Burger King
restaurant network.

Other capital expenditures increased by €7.4 million to €8.0 million for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2021, from €0.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, and were mainly
related to network management costs and the acquisition of business goodwill and shares of three
Burger King Company Restaurants during the first semester of 2021.

million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from €23.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. Capital expenditures for restaurant conversions during the year ended December 31, 2020 was
primarily due to (i) the completed conversion of nine Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants, of
which four were Company Restaurants and five were Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants
and (ii) the conversion of seven additional Quick restaurants which were temporarily closed for
conversion as of December 31, 2020. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, 29 Quick

Other capital expenditures increased by €28.5 million, to an expense of €4.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, from an income of €24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
This increase was primarily due to real estate disposals and network management related to our
franchise operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Commodity price risk_

Our restaurants are subject to commodity price risk related to food costs and related packaging,
mostly correlated to underlying commodities such as beef, chicken and paper (for packaging). We are
also indirectly exposed to grains and fuel prices as they are inputs for certain raw materials we purchase
and an input in our logistics costs. In the case of Franchise with Lease Management restaurants, the
foregoing risks are limited as they are borne directly by the franchisees.

_Exchange rate risk_

We have no significant exposures to foreign exchange rate risk as the majority of our revenues,
expenses and indebtedness are denominated in euro.

_Interest rate risk_

We are subject to interest rate risks related to our indebtedness that are linked to EURIBOR
plus certain margins.

**The French restaurant market or the OOH market**

The French restaurant market or the OOH market is one of the key contributors to the French
economy, representing approximately 2% of France’s GDP in 2020. According to GIRA Foodservice,
sales in the OOH market in France grew from approximately €72.4 billion in 2017 to reach approximately
€76.8 billion in 2019, representing a CAGR of approximately 3.0%. In 2020, the OOH market declined
to approximately €47.8 billion due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, representing a decline of 38%
compared to 2019.

The French OOH market consists of two main sectors, the collective catering and the
commercial restaurant sector. The collective catering sector includes employer restaurants, school
restaurants, health and social restaurants and other collective segments and had total sales of
approximately €20.4 billion in 2019 and €15.2 billion in 2020. The commercial restaurant sector includes
traditional restaurants, self-service restaurants, QSR, in-transit restaurants, hotel and concession
restaurants, and had total sales of approximately €56.4 billion in 2019 and €32.6 billion in 2020.
Between 2019 and 2023, revenue of the OOH market in France is expected to grow by approximately
€1.6 billion, i.e., representing a CAGR of approximately 0.5%, with the QSR segment representing the
primary driver of such projected growth.

The graphic below presents a simplified version of the French OOH market and the respective
revenue of each segment for 2019:

**The QSR Segment**

The QSR segment in France includes any type of restaurant where consumers are able to order
food “on-the-go”. The QSR segment comprises any type of restaurant serving “on-the-go” food such as
hamburgers, sandwiches, kebabs, fried chicken, sushi, pizza or health conscious quick service

149


-----

restaurants. Chain restaurants play an important role in the QSR segment. Sales in the QSR segment
totaled approximately €19.5 billion in 2019 and grew at a CAGR of approximately 6.8% between 2017
and 2019; whereas the French OOH market overall grew at a CAGR of approximately 3.0% during the
same period. In 2020, the QSR segment generated approximately €13.4 billion in sales, representing a
decline of approximately 31.2% as compared to 2019; whereas the French OOH market overall declined
by 37.7% during the same period. It is expected that sales in the overall QSR segment will grow at a
CAGR of approximately 2.8% between 2019 and 2023 (9.0% between 2021 and 2023).

The following graphic presents the growth of the OOH market and the QSR segment as
compared to overall French GDP growth (set to 2017 levels).

**_Performance of the QSR segment during the COVID-19 crisis_**

The QSR segment in France has been the most resilient segment within the OOH market during
COVID-19. We believe that the following fundamental characteristics of the QSR segment, as well as
the scale and capabilities of the large QSR operators, have contributed to the relative strength of the
segment:

  - trust of customers in well-known, reputable brands operating in the QSR segment;

  - ability of large QSR operators to implement effective sanitary measures in a rapid manner;

  - prevalence and availability of off-premise channels (such as Click & Collect, drive-through
and delivery) during periods of lockdown and restricted on-premise consumption; and

  - Continued investment by QSR operators in digital channels to enhance customer experience.

As a result, the QSR segment (excluding cafés and bars) has materially outperformed other
OOH segments with only 23.8% decline between 2019 and 2020, compared to 37.7% decline in the
overall OOH market during the same period. Similarly, according to the NPD Group, on a like-for-like
basis, the QSR segment has returned to growth in the first half of 2021 with segment sales increasing
10.6% compared to the first half of 2020, whereas the overall OOH market has continued to decline
14.1% compared to the first half of 2020.

As such, according to the NPD Group, the QSR segment has gained significant incremental
share of the OOH market over this period, accounting for 44% and 55% of the away-from-home market
in 2020 and the first half of 2021, respectively, compared to 36% in 2019.

**_Growth in the QSR Segment_**

The QSR segment’s strong performance in France has been driven by changes in consumer
habits over time. We believe that the following factors contribute to this positive trend:

150


-----

_Less time dedicated to meals_

With increasingly busier lifestyles, longer working hours and a desire to maximize leisure time,
consumers devote less time to the preparation and consumption of meals. This trend favors the QSR
segment, which offers consumers “on-the-go” food that they may purchase and consume quickly.

_Consumer focus on affordability_

We believe that consumers have become more cost conscious in recent years as a result of
the economic recession in France following the COVID-19 crisis and that their income available for
restaurant discretionary spending has been constrained by the increase in spending in “tech” expenses,
driving the local population to increasingly seek the greatest value for their money. According to a
consumer sentiment study by the NPD Group, 46% of French people think that an attractive price is
one of their main criteria to select a restaurant since the beginning of the crisis.

According to a recent study by the NPD Group, within the commercial restaurant sector, the
QSR segment is the most affordable with an average ticket price in 2020 of €5.42, compared to an
average ticket price for full-service restaurants segment in the same period of €12.76.

_Ability to increase average ticket price_

The average ticket price for restaurants in the QSR segment increased at a faster rate than
other categories in the French OOH market. In France, the average ticket for the QSR segment for main
meals grew at a CAGR of approximately 7.7% between 2019 and 2020.

We believe that the following factors have contributed to this accelerated growth rate:

    - _Affordability: as the product offering within the QSR segment is significantly more_
affordable than other categories within the commercial restaurant sector, any increase in
price naturally starts from a lower base;

    - _Product variety: restaurants within the QSR segment increasingly complement their_
classic menu options with a variety of new products to expand their traditional meal
options. This variety increases customers’ basket size by encouraging them to order
additional items (such as ice cream and additional portions of sides); and

    - _Families and groups of young adults: as more and more families choose to take certain_
meals out of the home, they are becoming an increasingly large part of the QSR
segment’s customer base compared to other segments within the commercial restaurant
sector. Families are often attracted by the lower prices, product variety and child-friendly
environments common to the QSR segment. This in turn translates into higher average
tickets. In addition, the QSR segment is attractive to young adults as it is more affordable
than other segments within the commercial restaurant sector and provides a convivial
environment for groups of young adults to interact and socialize.

_Increased out-of-home consumption as a result of the dominant and growing position of chain_
_restaurants over independents_

The increased density of chain restaurants has been one of the key factors behind the growth
of the French OOH market as it has facilitated consumers’ accessibility to away-from-home dining by
increasing the number of restaurants, as chains are able to open new restaurants more easily than
independent operators.

Chain restaurants have the ability to leverage economies of scale and benefit from a logistics
advantage to provide consumers with a varied menu featuring competitively priced meals of consistent
quality throughout the network. The ability of chain restaurants to offer significant pricing discounts,
combined with the significant financial resources they devote to marketing campaigns, also contributes
to their success. In addition, when traveling, a consumer may prefer a chain restaurant which provides
a harmonized level and standard of service throughout its extensive national network. The contribution

151


-----

of chain restaurants to the commercial restaurant sector’s sales in France increased steadily between
2017 and 2020, from approximately 36.8% to approximately 40.5%.

_Health and wellness_

In recent years, consumers have become increasingly health-conscious and mindful of the
importance of a balanced and nutritious diet. This heightened awareness is partly due to ongoing health
and wellness campaigns across Europe, emphasizing the benefits of “healthy” foods such as meat
alternatives, fresh fruits and vegetables. Consumers are also increasingly knowledgeable about specific
diet-related health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and obesity, which has led to an increase in
the demand for healthier food products such as fish, vegetables and poultry.

Players in the QSR segment have been able to quickly adapt to changing health and wellness
trends, with major chain restaurants now highly focused on improving the nutritional quality of their
offerings and communicating nutritional information on the packaging of their products. QSR players
are also committed to developing and expanding their menus to incorporate healthier alternatives (for
example, plant-based meat alternatives, salad and fresh fruit), which appeals to a wider consumer base.

_Growing share of non-traditional daypart consumption in the QSR segment_

The QSR segment has historically generated the largest part of its sales during traditional
dayparts, with customer traffic generally concentrated around lunchtime, and to a lesser extent during
dinner. In recent years, QSR operators have continued to expand their menu offering into non-traditional
dayparts, such as breakfast, coffee and snacks, by leveraging their convenience-driven service models.
With increasing consumer receptivity to convenient and affordable options, this represents a growth
opportunity for QSR players to address incremental demand and capture a larger share of meal
occasions throughout the day.

_Growing use of digital channels_

Digital channels and tools have steadily gained traction within the QSR segment with the
increasing accessibility and consumer acceptance of various digital tools. As a result, digital sales have
become an important driver of growth for QSR operators, driven both by increased consumer
convenience and the expansion of digitally-enabled value propositions.

Branded mobile applications and presence on third-party delivery applications enable QSR
players to build a direct relationship with customers and create a fully-integrated and highly-convenient
experience, whether through Click & Collect or home delivery. Furthermore, growth in digital sales
provides the ability to leverage the existing network of QSR operators, which helps achieve operating
efficiencies, for example through the use of digital kiosks, tablets and mobile payments, which enhances
the customer journey for on-premise and drive-through customers. With the continued expansion of this
channel, QSR operators also have the opportunity to increase brand awareness through the use of
social media, leverage valuable customer data to acquire new customers and extract higher customer
lifetime value through digital loyalty programs.

During the COVID-19 crisis, the growth in the use of digital channels has been further
accelerated by the lockdowns and curfews restricting on-premise consumption, resulting in a 22% year
on year growth in digital orders for commercial restaurant in France in March 2021 according to the
NPD Group. As of the end of May 2021, according to the NPD Group, QSR is leading the path,
representing up to 81% of digital orders in commercial restaurants.

**The QSHR category**

The largest category of the QSR segment in France is the QSHR category, which in 2019
recorded approximately €8.1 billion of sales, representing approximately 60% of the total sales in the
QSR segment (excluding cafés and bars). In 2020, the QSHR category recorded approximately €6.2
billion of sales. Chain restaurants play an important role in the QSHR category, generating in excess of
approximately 97% of the category’s sales in 2020. Sales in the QSHR category grew at a CAGR of
approximately 8.4% between 2017 and 2019. The graphic below shows the split of the QSHR segment
(excluding cafés and bars) in France in 2020 in terms of sales.

During the COVID-19 crisis, the QSHR category has been the most resilient category within
the QSR segment. Similar to the trends discussed above, the large QSHR operators within the category
have benefited from consumer trust in their well-known brands, their ability to take effective sanitary
measures and the availability of off-premise channels during lockdown periods.

As a result, according to GIRA Foodservice, the QSHR category has outperformed other QSR
categories with only 22.9% decline between 2019 and 2020, compared to a 37.1% decline in the overall
QSR segment excluding QSHR during the same period.

We believe that the ability of QSHR chains to adapt their offering to consumer demands (such
as speed of service, extended operating hours, children/family-friendly environment and food as an
indulgence) is a key factor underlying the success of the QSHR category compared to other QSR
categories or the commercial restaurant sector (see “—The QSR Segment—Growth in the QSR
_Segment—Increased out-of-home consumption as a result of the dominant and growing position of_
_chain restaurants over independents”)._

The QSR segment overall, and the QSHR segment in particular, have been the fastest growing
restaurants in the French commercial restaurant market over the 2017 to 2019 period as well as
between 2019 and 2020, and are expected to continue this trend through 2023, which are demonstrated
by the charts below.

**Competitive landscape**

As discussed above, QSHR sales are the largest category of the approximately €13.4 billion
QSR (excluding cafés and bars) segment in France as of 2019 (€10.2 billion as of 2020). The main
players in the QSHR category are McDonald’s and Burger King, which together accounted for
approximately 84% of QSHR category sales in France as of the first half of 2021, according to the NPD
Group. As of December 31, 2020, McDonald’s had 1,468 restaurants in France, and Burger King had
399 restaurants as of June 30, 2021. The third player in France, KFC, operated a network of 272
restaurants in France as of December 31, 2020.

The following graphic presents the market share of chain restaurants in the QSHR category in
terms of market share as of the first half of 2021:

According to the NPD Group, from 2017 to March 2021, the market share of Burger King in the
QSHR segment doubled to approximately 15% (7 percentage points increase), as compared to KFC’s
market share, which increased by approximately 2 percentage points, and as compared to McDonald’s
market share, which decreased by approximately 4 percentage points. Furthermore, our market share
in QSHR digital sales, referring to delivery and Click & Collect, increased to approximately 14%
following its launch in France in 2020, as compared to KFC's market share, which decreased by
approximately 4%, and McDonald's market share, which decreased by approximately 0.6 percentage
points.

Our main competitor, McDonald’s, focuses its business model on appealing to a large
consumer base with an extensive product offering which it tailors to appeal to the French consumer. It
operates a similar franchise business model to that of Burger King. As of 2017, approximately 80% of
its restaurants are operated by franchisees and the other 20% are directly operated by the company.

KFC operates a smaller network in France than Burger King. We believe that KFC currently
has an established, specific customer base, but that it is willing to expand its base to a broader clientele,
in particular by appealing to families, who have proven to be an important factor for the entire QSR
segment.

154


-----

In addition to competing with other QSHR players, we also compete with the second largest
category within the QSR segment, sandwich shops and viennoiseries. Sandwich shops and
viennoiseries had total sales of approximately €2.2 billion in 2019 (€1.6 billion in 2020). Generally
considered to be a healthy meal choice, sandwiches are popularly known as French fast food and target
a different usage than hamburgers. In 2020, sandwich shops in France maintained approximately a
16.4% market share (in terms of sales) of the QSR segment (excluding cafés and bars). Sandwich
shops’ sales grew at a CAGR of approximately 2.9% between 2017 and 2019 and declined 28.2%
between 2019 and 2020 (compared to the approximately 8.4% CAGR and 22.9% decline for the QSHR
category over the same period).

However, competition between hamburgers and sandwiches is limited as QSHR restaurants
and sandwich shops have different market positions. Generally, QSHR restaurants appeal to a wider
consumer base. Restaurants in this category include drive-thru locations, city center restaurants and
restaurants located in shopping centers. Sandwich shops however, are principally located in city
centers. In addition, sandwich shops tend to target the working population; whereas QSHR restaurants
aim to appeal to a younger clientele (mainly, between 15 and 34 years old) and children and families
(for example, by including kids menus and playground areas). Lastly, sandwich shop’s sales are mostly
concentrated around lunch time.

QSHR restaurants, however, serve meals that are relatively equally distributed between lunch
and dinner. Further, sandwich shops rarely offer their customers the ability to consume their meals on
site. A critical feature of the QSHR restaurant is that consumers are free to choose whether to consume
their meal on site or elsewhere. This offers consumers an additional choice that most sandwich shops
are unable to provide their customers.

Notwithstanding the projected overall growth of the sandwich shop category, this category is
highly fragmented, with a significant majority of sandwich shops in France owned by independents and
the remainder by chain restaurants (for example, Brioche Dorée, Paul and Subway) which
systematically enjoy a more positive image than hamburger restaurants. A significant majority of
sandwich shops in France are owned by independents and the remainder by chains (for example,
Brioche Dorée, Paul and Subway). Other than Subway, which operated approximately 350 locations in
France, it is unlikely that any single sandwich shop chain in France currently has sufficient resources
or influence to match that of the two major QSHR chain restaurants in terms of advertising and
communications.

Although we do not consider Subway to be a direct competitor, it does compete for a similar
customer base, mainly in city center areas, as all of their restaurants are located in these areas. There
are also other categories within the QSR segment in France such as kebab, sushi, pizza and other
types of snack restaurants that are experiencing overall growth. However, these types of restaurants
remain marginal within the QSR segment in France, and represented, in the aggregate, approximately
23.2% of the market share in terms of sales in 2019.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are Burger King France, resolutely focused on the expansion of the world’s second largest
QSHR chain in the French market which is characterized by secular, long-term demand for eating out
and a strong affinity for our brand. Guided by the Burger King philosophy of “Have it your way”, we offer
customers a differentiated eating experience, combining high-quality food, such as our flame-grilled
hamburgers, with attractive restaurant locations.

In 2013, our principal shareholder Groupe Bertrand reintroduced the Burger King brand to the
French market after a 15-year absence, by signing of an exclusive master franchise agreement between
Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. Groupe Bertrand is a leader
in the French restaurant industry, known for its ability to roll out and transform restaurant concepts.
Following our acquisition in 2015 of Financière Quick Group, an incumbent QSHR operator with nearly
400 prime restaurant locations in France, we demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of
our Burger King network in France, both through the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King
brand, as well as through new Burger King restaurant openings. As of June 30, 2021, we operated
412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be
converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion) and as
of August 31, 2021, we operated 413 restaurants under the Burger King brand (425 restaurants
including nine restaurants under the Quick brand to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term
and three Quick restaurants under conversion).

Our mission is to continue to deliver a high-quality service to our customers and support the
growth of our franchisees through expansion of new Burger King restaurants. We are committed to strict
development criteria, prioritizing sustainable initiatives and seeking to exploit economies of scale to
further growing our EBITDA. Our business model features a mix of predominantly Franchise with Lease
Management Restaurants and Pure Franchise Restaurants, and to a lesser extent Company
Restaurants. We believe this model enables us to manage our growth flexibly while controlling the
locations of the restaurants in our network. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 83% of our Burger King
restaurants are Franchise Restaurants under the Burger King brand and the remaining 17% are
Company Restaurants, a balance that supports our gross margin and reduces our capital expenditure
requirement for expansion. As of June 30, 2021, we were the direct lessee for or owner of approximately
87% of the restaurant locations in our network, compared to 85% of the restaurant locations in our
network as of December 31, 2018.

In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s,
KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked
customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. The strong recognition of
the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide,
serves as a solid base to attract customers and prospective franchisees.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) for Burger
King restaurants was approximately €2.8 million.

We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with locations throughout the country and
approximately 15% market share by sales of burgers in 2021 (up from 8% in 2017), generating
€1,056.7 million in SWS, €448.3 million in revenue (reported) and €151.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA
(reported) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, with 412 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 (399
of which were under the Burger King brand).

**Our History**

Burger King France was established in October 2013 by our principal indirect shareholder
Groupe Bertrand and BKC, through its affiliate BK (UK) Company Ltd, to hold the master franchise
conferred by BK Europe (as of November 2013) and develop the Burger King brand in France.
Established in 1997, Groupe Bertrand, founded more than 20 years ago, specializes in the restaurant
industry in France and is active across several segments of the commercial restaurant sector, including
through the operation of restaurants, both chains and individual restaurants, master franchises and
concessions. Groupe Bertrand operates several well-known restaurant throughout France including
large breweries (such as L’Alsace, Au Pied de Cochon, le Bar André à La Rochelle, Bofinger, la
Brasserie Lipp, La Coupole, Grand Café Capucines, La Lorraine, Le Procope, Terminus Nord,
Vaudeville); Parisian restaurants (such as Auteuil Brasserie, L’Île, Copenhague, Flora Danica, Polpo,
Quai Ouest, Les Deux Stations, Le Sir Winston); tea rooms (such as Angelina); concessions and events
(such as Château de Versailles, Jardin des Plantes, Jardin des Tuileries, Jardin du Luxembourg,
Giverny, Cité des Sciences, Printemps Haussmann, Musée des Armées); chains (such as Au Bureau,
Hippopotamus, Café Leffe, Bert’s, Volfoni, Léon); and fast food restaurants such as Burger King
France. Groupe Bertrand is also active in the leisure and hotels industry. Burger King previously
operated in France between 1980 and 1997, when it decided to discontinue its operations in France for
strategic reasons. Following a 15-year absence from the French market, Burger King returned to France
first in Marseille Provence airport in 2012 and then in Paris at the Saint-Lazare train station in 2013.
Once Burger King France signed the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe in November 2013,
both restaurants became part of Burger King France. In 2014, the Burger King App was first launched.
In 2015, Burger King France’s first full year of activity, 16 Burger King restaurants were opened in
France. In December 2015, we acquired Quick as a means of accelerating our penetration of the French
market through a process of converting Quick locations into Burger King locations. Quick, founded in
1970 as one of the first European QSR chains and which had expanded into France in 1980, held an
extensive network of 393 restaurants as of December 31, 2015. In order to focus on building the Burger
King brand in France, we launched the Quick conversion program which involved selling the Quick
activities in Belgium and Luxembourg in September 2016. The first Quick conversion was in September
2016, with a total of 36 converted restaurants in 2016. In 2017, we aired our first advertising on national
television. In July 2018, Bridgepoint acquired a minority stake in a holding company of Burger King
France to further support the development of the Burger King brand in France alongside Groupe
Bertrand. Following a total of 224 conversions of Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants, in
October 2021, we completed the disposal of the remaining restaurants operating under the Quick brand
through the sale of 100% of the shares of Quick Restaurants S.A. As of June 30, 2021, we operated a
total of 412 restaurants, including 399 Burger King restaurants, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted
or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion. During our early
ramp up period from 2013 to 2015, the number of our restaurants grew from 3 in 2013 to 16 in 2014
and to 42 in 2015. During our conversion period, the number of our restaurants increased to 108 in
2016 to 203 in 2017 and to 290 in 2018. In addition, there were 70 conversions of Quick in 2017 and
63 conversions in 2018. Our switch to an asset-light business model allowed our number of restaurants
to grow to 340 in 2019 and 369 in 2020, with a projected total of 435 in 2021. In addition, there were 29
conversions of Quick in 2019, 9 conversions in 2020 and 15 conversion in 2021.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_Attractive and resilient market in France with steady growth characteristics_**

We believe that the QSR market in France benefits from strong and sustainable growth
characteristics with demonstrated resilience through business cycles, as well as in the face of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The QSR segment has historically experienced a steady growth rate in France,
and we believe that it has significant untapped potential. According to GIRA Foodservice, absolute sales
in the French QSR market grew at a CAGR of 6.8% per annum between 2017 and 2019 from
approximately €17.1 billion in 2017 to €19.5 billion in 2019. The QSR market has historically been the
key driver of growth in the OOH market, with a CAGR of 6.8% between 2017 and 2019, compared to a

157


-----

CAGR of 3.5% for the commercial restaurants and a CAGR of 3.0% for the total OOH). Based on GIRA
Foodservice, the QSR market also increased its share of the commercial restaurants market from 32%
in 2017 to 41% in 2020. Although QSR market sales temporarily decreased in 2020 due to the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic in absolute terms (decreasing by 31.2% between 2019 and 2020), according
to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, sales have significantly increased by 10.6% in the first half of
2021 compared to the same period during the prior year.

The QSHR category in the broader QSR market also exhibited growth throughout these same
periods. QSHR is the largest category within the broader QSR segment and has been a significant
driver of the growth in the French QSR market. According to GIRA Foodservice, sales in the QSHR
market grew at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2017 and 2019, from approximately €6.9 billion in 2017 to
€8.1 billion in 2019. As with the QSR segment as a whole, the QSHR market temporarily decreased in
2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit at a lower rate than the QSR market. We
observed the relative resilience of the QSR market and outperformance of the QSHR market during
COVID-19 compared to the total commercial restaurants/total OOH, with a decrease of 22.9% in
absolute sale in the QSHR segment and 31.2% in the QSR segment versus 42.2% for the total
commercial and 37.7% for the total OOH in 2020 compared to 2019. Notwithstanding this temporary
decrease in 2020, according to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, the QSHR market's sales
increased by 29.7% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period during the prior year. Based
on GIRA Foodservice, its share in the QSR market increased from 40% in 2017 to 47% in 2020. In
addition, GIRA Foodservice expects sales in the QSR segment to exceed 2019 levels in 2022, with
projected sales amounting to €20.6 billion in 2022 as compared to €19.5 billion in 2019. GIRA
Foodservice expects the QSR market to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.8%, between 2019 and
2023, compared to a growth at a CAGR of approximately 0.6% in the overall commercial restaurants
sector in France, which is expected to increase its sales from approximately €56.4 billion in 2019 to
€57.7 billion in 2023.

We believe the French QSR market has significant penetration potential and that we are poised
to take advantage of this growth. The QSR market in France, which was a €19.5 billion market in 2019,
has a lower penetration rate than other Western European countries, although it is growing fast and
roughly in line with the growth rates in such other countries. For example, the QSR market grew in
France at a rate of 7.4% between 2018 and 2019 and the QSHR category grew at a rate of 9.3% over
the same period. Further, we believe there is significant whitespace potential in France based on the
average annual commercial foodservice spend per inhabitant in France (€640), which in the year 2017
was much lower as compared to its neighboring countries, such as the United Kingdom (€831) or
Belgium (€842), according to GIRA Foodservice. The French market is generally characterized by more
stringent anti-competition regulations than other Western European markets, limiting the number of
chains in operation in France, which could prevent new market entrants. In addition, we believe that our
successful business model serves as a barrier to entry because brand equity and prime locations
throughout mainland France cannot be easily replicated by new entrants due to the significant
investment levels required and the necessary time to attain our economies of scale, operational and
logistics know-how. As a result, through our established presence in the French market, we believe we
have a strong competitive advantage in the face of potential competitors or new market entrants.

This long-term growth potential is underpinned by structural changes in customer habits and
way of life, which we believe are favorable for QSR restaurant operators. These trends include
increasing digital penetration and out-of-home convenience-oriented food consumption, favoring value
for money, preferences for health-conscious and quality product offerings and the expansion of daypart
opportunities. Such structural trends in French society foster an increased demand for the QSR
segment. According to NPD, there has been a 5 percentage points growth in share of restaurant chains
to 61% as of March 2021 year on year. Furthermore, 46% of French people name attractive price as
their main selection criteria for a restaurant. Certain of these favorable trends were accelerated as a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, customers have more increasingly relied
on digital channels (such as home delivery and Click & Collect options) and convenient and affordable
dining options. According to NPD, the QSR share of commercial restaurants digital orders is now 81%
with a 22% growth in digital orders as of March 2021 year on year. More than 90% of Burger King
France restaurants offer Click & Collect following the launch in 2020. Customers have also

158

demonstrated their loyalty to strong brands that successfully address the aforementioned evolving
preferences. See – “Industry”.

**_Well-established leading market position underpinned by a distinctive global brand and high_**
**_local recognition_**

We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with approximately 15% market share by
sales in the first half of 2021 according to the NPD Group, which has almost doubled in comparison to
our 8% market share in 2017. Our market position is supported by our extensive and growing restaurant
network. In the last few years, the sizes of our respective Burger King brand network and franchise
network have significantly expanded, with our Burger King brand network almost doubling from 203
restaurants as of December 31, 2017 to 399 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 and our franchise network
for Burger King restaurants increasing from 158 franchise restaurants as of December 31, 2017 to 330
franchise restaurants as of June 30, 2021. Throughout these periods, our Group has also demonstrated
strong sales per unit, with average sales per unit in 2019 of €3.2 million for restaurants with more than
12 months of historical operation.

Our leading market position in France is underpinned by the distinctive Burger King global
brand and high local recognition in France. We are Burger King’s master franchisee in France and are
well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the
restaurant industry worldwide. Burger King is the world’s second largest QSHR chain in terms of total
number of restaurants with over 18,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The chain had more
than $20.0 billion of SWS for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a Burger King master franchisee
we benefit from Burger King’s international brand awareness, its distinctive product offer, unique
cooking method, efficient and reliable supply chains and food quality reputation. We also benefit from
Burger King's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and
generate increased footfall in our restaurants. Over the years, Burger King has launched innovative and
creative multimedia advertising campaigns that highlight the popular relevance of the Burger King brand
globally.

We believe we are well positioned to further increase our market position by closing the market
share gap between ourselves and McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, which held 69% market
share as of the first half of 2021 Our strong brand awareness and growing market share are supported
by our high-quality and innovative product offering, our focus on expanding digital convenience options
for our customers and our unique local communication strategy. Our focus on innovation in terms of
digital convenience for our customers has further contributed to the strengthening of our market share.
Following the launch of home delivery and Click & Collection options respectively in 2019 and in 2020,
our market share of digital sales (measured by the number of transactions) steadily increased to 14%
as of March 2021. In addition, we also expanded our digital sales channel in 2020 through the mobile
Burger King app, which now includes our expanded customer loyalty program. Our Burger King app
was downloaded on average 5,000 times a day during the first six months of 2021 and has increased
to a daily download rate of 10,000 times a day during promotions. Our Kingdom loyalty program had
more than 3.6 million registered members as of the end of September 2021. In addition, over the last
few years we have expanded home delivery options through our partnerships with home delivery
services such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. Our rate of home delivery increased by four times
from 15 transactions per day per restaurant in July and August 2019 to more than 60 transactions per
day per restaurant in July and August 2021. We expect the volume of our digital sales to increase, along
with growth in the French QSR market and as digital penetration grows in line with increased focus on
digital convenience.

We enjoy strong brand recognition in France, supported by customer's perception of the taste
and quality of our products according to KANTAR. In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among
QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a
KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these
QSR brands. In addition, we invest annually (through contributions from both our Company Restaurants
and Franchise Restaurants) in innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns at the French
national level, which we believe reinforce Burger King’s growing brand awareness in France and have

159


-----

a positive impact on our level of SWS. According to an IFOP (Institut français d'opinion publique) survey
on the French population, our brand awareness has improved in France from 72% Spontaneous
Awareness in 2018 to 83% in 2021 while our Total Brand Awareness has remained stable reflecting
91% in both 2018 and 2021. In addition, according to KANTAR, our brand equity has also improved,
with an increase in the power of our brand equity from 18 in March 2018 to 21 in April 2021 (out an
index of 100). The strong and growing recognition of the Burger King brand in France, together with
Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide, serves as a solid base to further increase our
market share.

**_Broad footprint and diversified channel mix with strong digital and contactless capabilities_**

Our extensive restaurant network reflects a balanced approach of different formats and sizes
appropriately tailored for each of the locations in which we operate. We choose our restaurant sites
carefully and have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process that incorporates our
management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our
restaurant development team has extensive experience identifying and evaluating suitable restaurant
locations. As of June 30, 2021, we operated a network of 412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants
under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the shortterm and two Quick restaurants under conversion). At each of our sites, we select and develop one of
three of our principal restaurant formats: a free-standing drive-through facility format, a downtown
format and a shopping center or mall format. As of June 30, 2021, 328 of our restaurants reflected a
drive-through facility format, 39 of our restaurants reflected a downtown format, 26 of our restaurants
reflected a shopping center or mall format and 19 restaurants reflected other formats (including
restaurants located in travel locations such as airports, train stations and highway service concessions).
For our drive-through facility restaurants, which have historically represented our largest restaurant
type, we have developed three different restaurants sizes to best address market potential. We are also
focused on ensuring that most of our restaurant locations are well-suited to offer both take away and
home delivery services to our customers.

We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed complementary multi-channel
offerings that we believe have favorably positioned us to respond to evolving customer trends.
Particularly, we believe our multi-channel offering has underpinned the resilience of our business
(including during COVID-19) and maximize customer reach. Our customers can access our product
offer through multiple channels, including on-site through in-restaurant dining or drive-through orders,
online through Click & Collect services (which include services for on-site Click & Collect pick up through
our parking lots or drive-through lines or home delivery) and home delivery services (either through
third-party aggregators such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. In addition, we intend to begin to
roll out our own home-delivery services in certain locations, which we believe demonstrate an
opportunity to further develop our multi-channel approach.

A breakdown comparing our SWS by channel for the December 2019 and August 2021 period
are reflected in the chart below:

We have further optimized our restaurants and customer journey with a number of digital
initiatives that are consistent across all of our channels to better cater to our customers and improve
their dining experience. For example, we have enhanced our drive-through experience by accelerating
the order process through the use of digital tablets in our drive-through sites. All our restaurants have
been equipped with in-store kiosks since 2015. Since 2019, our drive-through capacity has doubled
based on the average number of cars per hour that passed through the drive-through. We have also
developed our mobile app to allow for Click & Collect orders directly in-app to facilitate easy ordering.
To further improve customers' in-dining experience, in 2021 we rolled out geolocalized table service in
approximately 250 restaurant locations, allowing dine-in customers to receive their meals directly at
their table and further supporting market share gains in the key target family demographic. As of the
date hereof, table service is available in more than half of our restaurant network, and we are targeting
the implementation of this service in approximately 80% to 90% of our restaurant network by the end of
2022. Customers can also now register purchases to their loyalty programs via scanner capabilities on
every touch point in order to facilitate customer identification. Thanks to our single PoS IT system that
is fully integrated across all of our network and distribution channels, we are able to achieve futureproof and scalable state-of-the-art operations monitoring and process management.

**_Agile business model with best-in-class operational expertise_**

We believe navigating the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated
the strength and resiliency of our business model and our ability to respond quickly to unprecedented
business disruption. At the on-set of the pandemic, our management team rapidly implemented various
cash management measures to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our operations and
liquidity position. Our management team prioritized various initiatives to strengthen our liquidity position,
including by drawing in full our Existing Revolving Credit Facility for a total of €60 million and entering
into the state-guaranteed PGE Loan (contrat de prêts garantis par l’État français) for a total of €80
million. In addition, in an effort to manage cash during the restrictive periods of the pandemic, we ceased
most external service expenditures such as cleaning, security and maintenance, both in our restaurants
and at our headquarters, and temporarily renegotiated our rental obligations of certain of our Company
Restaurants and supported our franchisees in the renegotiations of their rental obligations for certain
periods with our landlords. As a result, we were able to maintain a strong level of free cash flow since
the start of the pandemic. Further, we were focused on supporting our franchisees through the
challenges of the pandemic and closely monitored their financial health, adapting our support initiatives
as the impact of the pandemic on our franchisees' performance evolved. For example, during the period

161


-----

of the first lockdown in France, we implemented temporary royalty adjustments for our franchisees. We
also temporarily waived the obligation of our franchisees to pay us a minimum lease management fee.
As a result of such measures, none of our franchisees experienced a default of their payment obligations
to third parties.

We further believe that our strong restaurant-level operations coupled with our tight cost control
and disciplined cash management have allowed us to further enhance our resilient model to withstand
any future crises. In response to the pandemic, we implemented robust operational protocols to safely
continue our activity in compliance with government restrictions. While our restaurant opening plan was
impacted by the pandemic, we were still able to open a number of new restaurants during the COVID19 period and plan to continue to carry out the final conversions from the few remaining Quick
restaurants to the Burger King brand, which we believe demonstrates the confidence of our franchisees
and the strength of our strategy.

In addition, in continuation of our digital strategy and to cope with external restrictions, we
further enhanced our multi-channel offerings, including through the expansion of our drive-through and
takeaway services by using new Click & Collect channels as of July 2020, the development of our home
delivery options and our integration with third-party delivery aggregators. The further enhancement of
such offerings allowed us to protect our top line during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions by offsetting
the reduction in on-premise customer traffic and allowing customers to access our products through
alternate channels. Following the return of on-premises dining with the easing of COVID-19 lockdown
measures, we continue to benefit from the robust contribution of our off-premises channels, such as
delivery and Click & Collect options. We also regularly and proactively communicated with our
customers, which had a positive impact on our brand image. In response to a KANTAR survey in April
2021 which asked to what extent customers' image of fast food brands has improved, maintained or
gotten worse in the last months of the COVID-19 pandemic, 25% of respondents indicated that Burger
King had improved. Pursuant to the survey results, Burger King's operations reflected the highest
proportion of responses indicating improvement as compared to other fast food chains in France that
were mentioned in the survey, including McDonald's, KFC, Domino's and Subway. In addition to the
foregoing measures, we remained committed throughout the pandemic periods to our ESG best
practices, including introducing menu innovations that were healthy and nutritious, such as the launch
of our bowls and plant based offerings, and our continued efforts to enhance our supply chain with local
sourcing and pro-environment initiatives.

We believe that our SWS before and after each of the most severe COVID-19-related restrictive
periods in France (i.e., the first and second lockdowns in March to May 2020 and October to December
2020) demonstrate our ability to rapidly ramp up and down, with monthly sales immediately following
each lockdown nearly recovering to pre-lockdown periods. For example, in June 2020, our SWS under
the Burger King brand recovered to €73 million as compared to the €85 million pre-lockdown level in
February 2020. Similarly, in December 2020, the month during which the second lockdown restrictions
were lifted, our SWS reached €86 million as compared to the €94 million pre-lockdown SWS recorded
in October 2020. Further, despite the implementation of a curfew in France ending in June 2021, we
were able to achieve consistently increasing SWS levels from April 2021 through August 2021, which
we believe emphasizes the resilience of our business model, further supported by the long-term
integration of the measures we adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a demonstration
of this resilience our SWS in the months following the easing of lockdown restrictions in July and August
2021 reached historically record levels.

A breakdown of our SWS for each of our channels over the course of first lockdown, second
lockdown and post-lockdown periods is presented below:

Further, a breakdown of our monthly SWS during the period beginning January 1, 2020 through
August 31, 2021, as well as a breakdown of our quarterly EBITDA over those same periods, as
compared to the corresponding periods in 2019 is presented below:

**_Asset-light business model with high cash conversion_**

Our successful franchise-based business model, including a robust network of committed
franchise partners, generates recurring and predictable revenues with high EBITDA margin. As of June
30, 2021, 83% of our Burger King network restaurants were Franchise Restaurants under our Burger
King brand (compared to 70% as of December 31, 2016), with 17% of our restaurants operated as
Company Restaurants (compared to 30% as of December 31, 2016). While our previous strategy was
focused on the conversion of Quick restaurants and the progressive switch toward franchise

163


-----

restaurants, our current approach reflects a continuous focus on franchising most of our restaurants (29
out of 30 restaurant openings were franchise restaurants over the six-month period ended June 30,
2021), and we are now moving from conversions to new openings. This asset-light model allows for
higher cash conversion and reduces or eliminates for locations with third-party landlord agreements our
capital expenditures for such franchise openings. The table below demonstrates our enhanced cash
conversion (measured as pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA minus restaurant opening and conversion capex divided
by pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA) in recent years following our adoption of an asset-light franchise-focused
model for new restaurant openings, as compared to prior years. Our annual cash conversion ratio
increased from 4%, 2% and 19%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and
2018, as compared to 73%, 59% and 74%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020
and the twelve months ended August 31, 2021.

We believe that our "asset-light" operating model generates enhanced cash conversion and
significant recurring free cash flow primarily driven by royalties and lease payments collected from
franchisees based on sales levels, while limiting our capital expenditures. The corporate infrastructure
and capital expenditures necessary to support a franchise business model are substantially less than a
company-operated system, as franchisees and landlords assume most capital expenditure costs. In
particular, most of our openings are operated by franchisees under a lease management contract, and
when this franchise model is combined with third party landlord agreements we bear no capital
expenditure. We expect the continued success of our asset-light operating model, underpinned by the
completion of most of our Quick conversions pursuant to the disposal of most of our Quick restaurants
(see “Business—Quick Disposal”) and our continued preference for the Franchise with Lease
Management arrangements combined where possible with third party landlord agreements.

In addition, our franchise-based model allows us to retain strong control over our network
through our standard agreements with our franchisees, which govern various aspects of our
relationship, including the royalties and fees due by them to us. We believe that our franchise model
offers us favorable upsides and that our emphasis on growing this model in the future will continue to
drive high cash conversion.

**_Seasoned management team with a proven track-record supported by shareholders_**
**_experienced in our industry_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our senior management team. We
are led by our Managing Director, Jérôme Tafani, who joined the Group in February 2016 and previously
served as Executive Director for Chipotle Mexican Grill Europe and worked for more than 20 years at
McDonald’s, where he held several financial and operations positions before being appointed Managing
Director for France and Corporate Senior Vice President for Europe. Our Chief Financial Officer, Xavier
Cottineau, joined the Group in September 2016 after serving as Chief Financial Officer at Financière
Louis, as Finance Vice President at EuroDisney and senior financial auditor at
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our experienced management team has a long and successful history with
a proven track record of developing, integrating and operating in the QSR segment and has managed
to lead our Group through evolutions to its business model, support our Group's growing network

164


-----

(including its organic growth trajectory) and execute M&A transactions to further our business
strategies. Our management team has also successfully managed our business through challenges
that accompanied evolving government regulations and customer behavior in the face of the COVID19 crisis, and guided the recovery of our operations to strong levels following the easing of COVID-19
related restaurant closure measures.

We also benefit from the support and expertise of our significant shareholders, Groupe
Bertrand, which is a leading French operator of restaurant chains, and Bridgepoint, which is an
international alternative assed fund management group. Each of our shareholders provides us with
long-term support through their respective and complementary expertise. Groupe Bertrand was
founded by Olivier Bertrand more than 20 years ago. Groupe Bertrand has created and managed a fast
growing restaurant franchise group in France, with over 900 restaurants (both franchises and owned
restaurants) under management. Groupe Bertrand has demonstrated that it considers network
development over the long term, applies a cautious approach to risk management and enjoys a strong
entrepreneurial culture, which serve as further support to our senior management. Bridgepoint joined
as minority shareholder of our Group in July 2018 to further support the development of the Burger King
brand alongside Groupe Bertrand.

**Our Strategy**

Our objective is to grow our business and increase profitability by implementing the following
strategies:

**_Continue to take advantage of attractive market fundamentals_**

We intend to continue leveraging our extensive and prime-location restaurant network and
existing broad range of products, which covers value promotion menus and premium limited time
offerings to drive profitable restaurant sales and traffic. We also seek to expand our product offering by
relying on our expertise in creating innovative, premium convenience food products that match
customers’ demand, which we believe will be a key driver of our revenues. For example, we intend to
continue to expand our healthy and nutritious product offering through the introduction of additional
healthy options and preservative-free ingredients to further capture key markets, such as families, and
anticipate market trends toward local sourcing, value-for-money products and healthy food options as
well as meatless alternatives and products with no animal protein. We also plan to further strengthen
our multi-channel approach through the enhancement of takeaway options and the development of new
digital sales channels to further drive our growth. Finally, we intend to capitalize on increased
consumption opportunities by the continued operation of our restaurants in the afternoon or late-night
hours. We believe that we will continue to benefit from the support that BKC provides through its menu
items, product enhancements and reimaging initiatives, which combined with our continuous innovation
and operational expertise, will help drive overall consumption levels in the currently
moderately-penetrated French QSR segment.

**_Enhanced focus on digital transformation_**

We intend to increase our market share of digital sales in the QSR market through the continued
development and maintenance of our best-in-class multi-channel offering. We plan to continue to make
improvements to our existing digital sales channels in order to maintain and increase our digital sales,
while also developing additional innovative and convenient digital capabilities. While we have already
successfully integrated the use of in-app orders and pre-orders, Click & Collect orders, in-store tablets
that allow customers to skip the line and home delivery options with third-party aggregators, we also
see opportunity in expanding our digital channels, through, for example, white-label delivery. We believe
that the current trends and growth observed in our digital sales, accelerated as a result of the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate a distribution channel that adapts to the changing preferences
of our customers and is complementary to our in-restaurant dining channel. Further improving and
increasing sales through our digital channel will enable us to capture an additional segment of the
market by offering customers an easy and convenient dining option.

165


-----

**_Continue our commitment to sustainability and focus on improving our ESG performance_**

Improving our ESG initiatives and growing our network while prioritizing sustainability initiatives
is central to our business. Our key strategic ESG pillars include: (i) adapting our product offering to
address future global challenges, (ii) promoting the well-being of our teams and (iii) limiting our
environmental impact. With respect to our product offering, we intend to continue to promote local and
quality product sourcing, innovate our offer to provide healthy and responsible food options (through,
for example, a full permanent range of plant-based burgers, wraps, salads and sandwiches without
animal protein) and apply stringent safety standards to our operations. In promoting the well-being of
our teams, our goal is to create an inclusive workplace with frequent staff trainings and an emphasis on
fighting against harassment. We are also focused on limiting our environmental impact through waste
management initiatives, continued improvement of our logistics services and responsible growth of our
business.

We also seek to prioritize ESG initiatives in order to create and share value with our
stakeholders. For example, our New Revolving Credit Facility, to be entered into on or about the Issue
Date, will be based on sustainability-linked terms for its margin. In addition, we have adopted Burger
King's global ESG guidelines with an aim to exceed the baseline standards promoted therein.

**_Expand our restaurant network and profitably increase our market share_**

We believe there is significant untapped demand for the Burger King offering across France,
supporting the potential to continue our successful expansion strategy. Our network of Burger King
brand restaurants expanded from 16 as of December 31, 2014 to 399 as of June 30, 2021. Following
the Quick Disposal, we expect our network to increase, with over 400 targeted locations already
identified, providing us with significant room for further growth, particularly in light of the moderatelypenetrated French QSR market. For example, McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, has a
denser network of restaurants in France than Burger King, with approximately 1,500 restaurants (as of
June 2021) for McDonald’s, compared to 412 restaurants (as of June 2021) for Burger King (including
399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed
in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion). We believe we are well-positioned to
close the network density gap between ourselves and McDonald's and to further increase our market
positioning.

We plan to further expand our Burger King brand restaurant network in collaboration with
current and new franchisees to continue to increase our market share in the French QSHR category.
We expect that a higher density of restaurants will further contribute to brand awareness, support
customer loyalty and increase traffic in our existing restaurants, while our new restaurants will benefit
from our strong brand, reputation and know-how. We have a rigorous approach to expansion and expect
to promote new restaurant growth through the opening of Franchise with Lease Management
Restaurants, which allow us to retain a high degree of control over our network of restaurants, with
limited capital expenditure. Opening Company Restaurants requires significantly higher capital
expenditures and adds leases and personnel costs to our cost structure, whereas in franchise
arrangements, the cost impact of adding a new Franchise Restaurant is significantly reduced. As a
result, we intend to control the number of new Company Restaurants.

**_Focus on cost control and economies of scale_**

We intend to continue to improve our gross margin and profitable expansion through the
optimization of our supply chain and marketing. While Franchisees bear the food and logistic costs for
their restaurants, we organize and negotiate the sourcing for both Company and Franchise restaurants.
We source a wide range of ingredients, including beef and chicken, potatoes and other fresh and frozen
products and a variety of sauces to form our menu and we also incur logistics costs to store inventory
and transport raw materials and semi-finished products to such restaurant locations. Our food and
logistics costs are significant, and we believe that we could drive our gross margin through enhanced
control of our logistics costs by exploiting economies of scale in line with the growth of our restaurant
network, further developing local supplier networks and implementing cost control measures to reduce

166


-----

food waste. For example, we require all of our Burger King franchisees to source their raw materials
from suppliers that BKC has previously approved and with whom we intend to continue to leverage our
extensive restaurant network and economies of scale to obtain the most favorable commercial terms.
In addition, suppliers have sought to invest in long-term partnerships with us, which has allowed us to
reduce food costs and secure dedicated product lines to satisfy our needs. We also intend to enter into
exclusive deals with our suppliers, such as with Coca Cola or Nutella, driven by our brand image and
growth prospects.

Apart from focusing on the optimization of our supply chain, we intend to further develop our
communication and advertising campaigns to promote our brands, product offerings and commercial
offers in order to reinforce awareness of the Burger King brand, build on our image and increase
customer traffic, which we believe will also contribute to the improvement of our gross margin and
profitable expansion. As a result of our growing network and presence in France, we believe we will
have improved media buying conditions, allowing us to obtain a higher return on our marketing
expenses.

**_Drive EBITDA growth and cash generation to support deleveraging_**

Our franchise model, combined with an asset-light approach for a significant share of new
openings, is a pillar to our deleveraging strategy. We will continue to deploy this model with a
preference, where possible, for opening Franchise with Lease Management restaurants that permit us
to actively manage our network, target specific whitespace and encourage the formation of denser
clusters of restaurants, as well as to limit swings in our working capital. Where possible we will also
favor third party landlord agreements allowing us to effectively reduce our new opening capex spend to
nothing with a majority of our new openings under the asset-light model lease management. In addition,
we believe that tight cash control measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
coupled with the strong cash buffer built and maintained through the crisis, will allow us to continue
focusing on deleveraging in the periods to come.

**Our Business**

We are the master franchisee for the Burger King brand in France. We operate QSR restaurants
either directly through our subsidiaries or through franchisees. We have historically expanded the
footprint of the Burger King brand in France both through conversions of existing Quick restaurants to
the Burger King brand and through the opening of new Burger King restaurants. Pursuant to the terms
of the Quick Disposal, we have continued to operate a limited number of Quick restaurants (see “—
_Quick Disposal”). We intend to convert, sell or close those final remaining locations in the short-term_
and will then focus exclusively on organic expansion of the Burger King brand in France moving forward.
See “Forward-Looking Statements”.

In this “—Our Business” section, we have focused the discussion on the Burger King brand.
However, where relevant, we refer to the Quick brand in light of the expected conversions or definitive
closure of the final Quick restaurants that we continue to operate after the disposal. Our administrative
and operations structure is common to both the Burger King and Quick brands.

**_Quick Disposal_**

On July 29, 2021, Financière BKF (formerly Financière Quick) entered into an agreement (the
“Quick Securities Sale Agreement”) with funds controlled by H.I.G. Capital for the disposal of the
remaining 107 restaurants that the Group was operating under the Quick brand, excluding 11 Quick
restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short term and in respect of which we would be
able to continue using the “Quick” name until December 31, 2023 pursuant the Quick License
Agreement (as defined below)), through the sale of 100% of the shares of Quick Restaurants S.A., an
indirect subsidiary of the SSN Issuer. The consideration payable by the purchaser under the Quick
Securities Sale Agreement shall be equal to a base amount of approximately €245.0 million (including

167


-----

the Vendor Loan). On closing, the purchaser shall pay to Financière BKF the sum of the Base Amount
and the Earn-Out Amount, less a vendor loan of €5 million (the “Vendor Loan”). The Vendor Loan
bears 5% PIK interest and shall be junior to the purchaser’s third party debt financing but senior to the
equity and/or quasi equity of the purchaser. The Vendor Loan is repayable upon certain events and
otherwise by no later 6 months after the maturity of the purchaser’s debt financing.

The Quick Securities Sale Agreement contains (i) customary representations and warranties
from Financière BKF as seller to the purchaser (which, for certain representations and warranties, are
subject to the purchaser’s commitment to subscribe to a W&I insurance), and (ii) a 5-year undertaking
from the seller group not to be engaged in quick service restaurants selling exclusively or predominantly
Halal burgers (subject to exceptions) and not to use the “Giant” name. Prior to entering into the Quick
Securities Sale Agreement, the restaurants operated by the Group under the Quick brand had been
transferred under a specific subgroup headed by Quick Restaurants S.A., and had been classified as
discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements since January 1, 2019 in accordance
with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the_
_Comparability of the Financial Information Presented—Changes in consolidation scope”. The sale_
closed on October 8, 2021, generating approximately €245.0 million of proceeds(including the Vendor
Loan).

Pursuant to the Quick Securities Sale Agreement, on October 8, 2021, France BKR (formerly
France Quick SAS, a subsidiary of Financière BKF), Quick Restaurants SA and Quick Services SAS (a
subsidiary of Quick Restaurants SA) entered into a license agreement (the “Quick License
**Agreement”) whereby Quick Restaurants SA and Quick Services SAS granted France BKR a non-**
exclusive and irrevocable license, with sub-licensable rights, of the Quick brand, which France BKR will
use to continue to operate certain restaurants in France under the Quick brand until they are
progressively converted to the Burger King brand, closed or sold, under certain agreed conditions.

**_The Burger King Master Franchise Agreement_**

In November 2013, we entered into a master franchise and development agreement with BK
Europe for a period of 20 years, the duration of which has since been amended in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic to extend for an additional year through December 31, 2034 (such agreement, as
amended from time to time, the “Master Franchise Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Master
Franchise Agreement, we have the exclusive right to develop the Burger King brand in France and may
grant third parties the right to operate Burger King restaurants in exchange for the payment of royalties
and license fees. We are also entitled to use related trademarks, logos and trade names and receive
access to BKC’s know-how and the processes that it has developed. The Master Franchise Agreement
imposes certain obligations that we must respect in order to maintain the exclusive rights to develop
the Burger King brand in France. Certain default provisions under the Master Franchise Agreement
include, among others: (i) failure to pay BKC amounts we owe under the Master Franchise Agreement;
(ii) transferring or assigning our rights under the Master Franchise Agreement; (iii) if we or any of our
affiliates acquire an interest in a competitor; or (iv) if we enter into insolvency proceedings. If the Master
Franchise Agreement is terminated for any reason, we do not lose the right to continue the operation of
the Burger King restaurants that we have already established. However, we will lose our exclusivity
right and be unable to further expand our presence and market share in France.

The Master Franchise Agreement also contains certain covenants related to the expansion of
Burger King in France that we must respect in order to maintain the exclusive development rights for
the Burger King brand in France. Under the terms of the Master Franchise Agreement, after
December 31, 2021 (unless otherwise agreed with BKC), we will no longer be able to operate Quick
restaurants anywhere in the world. Thus, following the conversion or definitive closure in the short-term
of the small number of remaining Quick restaurants that we will continue to operate pursuant to the
Quick License Agreement, we intend to focus entirely on the Burger King brand. Franchisees have
historically been an important part of our business. Pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement, we
may enter into franchise agreements with third parties to operate and manage their own Burger King

168


-----

restaurants in France. We believe that franchisees provide us with the ability to expand our presence
in France while controlling our capital expenditures. As the master franchisee for France, we are
responsible for the management and strategic development of the network’s brand development,
promotion, execution of a marketing and advertising strategy and certain other services, for which we
are remunerated by franchisees through fees and royalties. We derive revenue from Franchise
Restaurants in the form of (i) royalties and franchise fees; (ii) advertising contributions; and (iii) rental
revenue from the properties that we lease to our Lease Management franchisees, in each case based
on a percentage of sales reported by franchisees (see “—Our Business—Restaurant operations—
_Types of franchise arrangements”). We also derive revenue from Company Restaurants in the form of_
direct sales.

**_Restaurant operations_**

We have two distinct operating models for our Burger King restaurants: Franchise Restaurants
and Company Restaurants, which represented approximately 83% and 17%, respectively, of our total
restaurants as of June 30, 2021 compared to 75% and 25%, respectively, of our total restaurants as of
December 31, 2018.

_Franchise Restaurants_

For the Burger King brand, Franchise Restaurants generated €829.6 million in SWS for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and 79% of our total SWS, compared to €670.8 million in SWS for
the year ended December 31, 2020 when Burger King Franchise Restaurants represented 75% of our
total SWS. For the Quick brand, Franchise Restaurants generated €31.9 million in SWS for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021, and 3% of our total SWS, compared to €39.9 million in SWS for the year
ended December 31, 2020 when Quick Franchise Restaurants represented 4% of our total SWS. For
Burger King France, Franchise Restaurants generated €186.4 million in Group revenue for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021.

_General franchise policy_

We have entered into an agreement with BKC, the owner of the Burger King brand, to act as
master franchisee for the Burger King brand in France. We are therefore responsible for approving new
franchisees in France. To that end, we are actively developing the brand and seeking strategic partners
who have already gained significant business experience to expand our network. Our franchise
operating model allows us to focus our resources on developing the brand with limited capital
expenditures while working with our franchisees to promote Burger King restaurants as attractive and
convenient dining destinations.

Protecting the integrity and reputation of the Burger King brand is an important business goal.
Before entering into a new agreement with a potential franchisee, we conduct certain due diligence
procedures regarding the potential franchisee. As a general rule, we do not grant any of our franchisees
the right to an exclusive territory. Our franchise agreements for Franchise with Lease Management are
generally valid for a period of nine years from the date of execution (or restaurant opening, as the case
may be) after which there is a twelve-month test period at the end of which the agreement is
automatically renewed if certain cumulative conditions relating to the franchisee, its financial situation
as well as compliance with the standards are met. The agreement can be renewed only once. If the
conditions are not met during the above mentioned twelve-month period, the agreement terminates at
the end of the first nine-year period. Our franchise agreements for Pure Franchises are generally
entered into for a period of ten years and may continue up to a duration of twenty years.

We encourage our franchisees to exhibit an entrepreneurial spirit and to take charge of their
business investment, while at the same time supporting them in their operations and growth. As an
integral part of our business, we have established a franchisee consultative committee which provides

169


-----

our franchisees with a forum where we may consult them on certain matters, such as advertising
campaigns. While this committee has no decision-making or budget-setting power, it provides our
franchisees with a further opportunity to maintain an open dialogue with the management of Burger
King France.

Franchisees are essential to the expansion of our network. We expect that after a franchisee
has successfully demonstrated the ability to manage one restaurant, the franchisee should be able to
successfully manage another, typically in the same area. When deciding to open a new restaurant in a
particular area, we prefer to use existing franchisees that are already operating restaurants in that
market. However, we do not anticipate that any franchisee would generally manage more than three to
five restaurants, depending on the catchment area and business case. This allows us to benefit from
and leverage the entrepreneurialism and restaurant experience of our current franchisees while
avoiding becoming dependent on any particular franchisee. As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of
117 franchisees and 330 Franchise Restaurants in our Burger King network. Our largest franchisee
operates eight restaurants.

We may terminate our agreements with our franchisees for certain reasons, including failure to
pay royalties and other fees and failure to operate the restaurant in accordance with our standards. As
the ultimate holder of the Burger King brand, BKC may also direct us to terminate any of our franchise
agreements under certain circumstances to protect the integrity of the Burger King brand. Our franchise
agreements also contain certain provisions that prohibit the franchisee from operating another
restaurant business that would compete directly with our business, or in a location where the restaurant
would compete with an existing Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant. In addition, our
agreements impose certain non-compete restrictions on our employees. For example, during the period
of an employee’s employment contract and for six months after such contract has been terminated, an
employee may not go and work in another Burger King restaurant.

_Types of franchise arrangements_

We use two types of franchise arrangements: lease management arrangements (location
_gérance) (“Franchise with Lease Management”) and traditional franchise arrangements (“Pure_
**Franchise”), each of which is briefly described below. While the obligations under our Franchise with**
Lease Management and Pure Franchise agreements are substantially similar, the main difference
between the two arrangements concerns the business assets rights (fonds de commerce). In a Pure
Franchise arrangement, the franchisee owns the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and as
such is fully responsible for the operation of the business and its relevant expenses. However, in a
Franchise with Lease Management arrangement, we maintain ownership of the business assets rights
(fonds de commerce) and authorize the franchisee to operate the business assets rights (fonds de
_commerce) in exchange for certain obligations. In addition, under our Pure Franchise arrangements the_
business goodwill ownership is held by the franchisee (and can be called at the option of the franchisor),
whereas under our Lease Management arrangements the business goodwill ownership is held by
Burger King France.

Although we have historically used both types of franchise arrangements, we now focus on
using Franchise with Lease Management arrangements for our Burger King franchise model and we
intend to limit the entry into Pure Franchise arrangements, mainly for sites related to concessions such
as airports, railway stations, or motorway service areas. The Franchise with Lease Management
arrangement allows us to retain a higher degree of control over the network of restaurants, with limited
capital expenditure, while at the same time benefiting from the local management expertise and capital
outlay of the franchisee. Whenever we can, we shift existing Pure Franchise arrangements to a
Franchise with Lease Management arrangement as we develop the Burger King brand in France.

As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of 54 Pure Franchise Restaurants and 285 Franchise with
Lease Management Restaurants, compared to a total of 72 Pure Franchise Restaurants and
292 Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants as of December 31, 2018. We intend to continue
to shift this trend towards Franchises with Lease Management as our network expands.

_Franchise with Lease Management_

In a Franchise with Lease Management arrangement, the franchisee maintains contractual ties
to us with both a franchise agreement and a tenancy agreement. Under this arrangement, we remain
the owner of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and leasehold rights. In general, we are
the tenant of record with respect to the restaurant real estate which we typically lease from third party
landlords and we, in turn, lease the restaurant real estate to the franchisee. Franchise with Lease
Management arrangements provide us with an enhanced ability to direct network density by proposing
new locations to new or existing franchisees. This allows us to manage the rollout of the Burger King
brand more closely. Under a Franchise with Lease Management agreement, the franchisee-lessee pays
us for the use of the real estate through a percentage of restaurant sales, typically subject to a minimum
yearly rent that coincides with our fixed costs under the relevant lease. In addition to these rent
payments, the franchisee is also responsible for brand royalty payments and advertising contributions.
These fees compensate us for the value of our business assets rights (fonds de commerce), which the
franchisee operates, as well as for franchisee access to our know-how. We have chosen to use
Franchise with Lease Management agreements as our preferred contractual arrangement for all of our
Burger King franchisees going forward (to the extent feasible) to have the same contractual relationship
with all of our franchisees and protect our business model by maintaining direct control over our
restaurant locations.

_Pure Franchise_

In a Pure Franchise arrangement, the franchisee is the tenant of record of the real estate where
the franchisee operates the Franchise Restaurant. While we have ultimate decision power when
choosing a new location for a restaurant, franchisees may propose a certain location that we may
consider when deciding whether or not to open in a specific location. In addition, the franchisee is the
owner of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and is solely responsible for the restaurant’s
necessary capital expenditures. We enter into Pure Franchise arrangements in certain limited
circumstances, for example in the event of a site concession that would prevent us from leasing the real
estate ourselves, and have maintained certain of our historical Pure Franchise arrangements. In a Pure
Franchise arrangement, franchisor revenue is primarily generated from royalty and license fees as the
lease revenue stream is not present in this arrangement.

_Royalties and Fees Paid by Franchisees_

When a franchisee opens or converts a restaurant to a new Burger King Franchise Restaurant,
we charge a new franchise fee, a portion of which we maintain as compensation for our role as master
franchisee. We pay BKC a portion of the new franchise fee to cover certain entrance fees owed in
connection with the opening of each new Burger King Franchise Restaurant.

We charge Burger King franchisees brand royalties generally equal to 9% of their sales (or 7%
for concessions only for our Pure Franchise restaurants). Under the terms of the Master Franchise
Agreement, we pay one half of this amount (i.e., 4.5% of sales) to BK Europe, the affiliate of BKC,
leaving us with a net amount of 4.5% of sales in brand royalties.

Our standard arrangement provides that Franchises with Lease Management pay rent equal to
a percentage of their sales typically ranging from 10% to 14% depending on the level of sales. As a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these royalty fees have been temporarily adjusted. See
_“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations have been and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other_
_similar pandemics”. As we are the tenant of record on the leases for Franchise Restaurants operated_
under Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, we directly pay the landlords for the use of
these properties. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, pre-IFRS 16 leasehold and occupancy
costs represented approximately 14% of our revenue, or 5% of the system wide sales, though rent is
typically a fixed sum, except for certain shopping mall locations.

171


-----

In addition to brand royalties, we also expect our franchisees to actively participate in the
development of the Burger King brand in France and to contribute to our marketing and advertising
campaign. Burger King franchisees contribute an amount equal to 3.5% of sales to the national
advertising fund that we manage, which, according to the Master Franchise Agreement and our own
franchise agreements, is used exclusively for communication and advertising expenses. In addition to
these advertising contributions, our franchisees must dedicate 1.5% of sales to local advertising,
typically for their own account, for a total advertising cost per franchisee equal to 5% of sales. See “—
_Group Operations—Marketing, advertising and promotions”._

_Company Restaurants_

In addition to Franchise Restaurants, we operate our own restaurants (“Company
**Restaurants”) to anchor our network, both in respect of key flagship locations and supply chain**
management, as well as demonstrate the benefits of operating Burger King restaurants and diffuse
know-how and innovations to current and potential franchisees. Company Restaurants also enable us
to contribute to the generation of economies of scale with respect to supply chain negotiations and
volume purchasing of food, equipment and other supplies. Additionally, Company Restaurants can be
operated temporarily or for the medium-term until future franchisees are chosen or a current franchisee
is ready to take possession of an additional Franchise Restaurant. We also intend to operate, directly
or indirectly, ten remaining Quick restaurants pursuant to the Quick License Agreement, which we
intend to convert to Burger King restaurants or definitively close in the short-term.

As of June 30, 2021, we operated 73 Company Restaurants, including 69 Burger King
restaurants and four Quick restaurants (comprising 18% of all restaurants), which generated
€195.2 million of SWS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Company Restaurants further
represented 18% of Group revenue for the same period. We foresee the opening of a limited number
of new Company Restaurants in order to favor the restaurants operated under Lease with Franchise
Agreement arrangements.

Our Burger King Company Restaurants are operated pursuant to a company franchise
agreement that we entered into with BK Europe in 2013 (the “Company Franchise Agreement”). The
Company Franchise Agreement replicates substantially all of the terms of our Master Franchise
Agreement, with the exception of the remuneration that we pay BK Europe and a royalty fee generally
representing 4.5% of restaurant sales per annum, which has historically changed during the term of the
Company Franchise Agreement pursuant to agreed-upon annual milestones. The Company Franchise
Agreement provides that these payments will incrementally increase throughout its duration. The
Company Franchise Agreement contains substantially similar terms and conditions, including
covenants to operate in compliance with defined operating protocols, and termination events to our
Master Franchise Agreement. However, our rights under the Company Franchise Agreement are
independent of our rights under the Master Franchise Agreement, and the termination of the latter does
not automatically terminate our rights to operate our Company Restaurants in accordance with the
Company Franchise Agreement.

_Economics_

The percentage of EBITDA that we generate from each of Company Restaurants and Franchise
with Lease Management Restaurants varies based on each arrangement. EBITDA generated from each
type of arrangement as a percentage of ARS depends on the following: (i) for Company Restaurants,
the EBITDA margin depends on the cost structure (including food and logistics costs, leasehold and
occupancy costs and labor costs) and 4.5% of sales as a royalty to BK Europe; and (ii) for Franchise
with Lease Management Restaurants, we generate EBITDA on a post-IFRS 16 basis corresponding to
approximately 16% of SWS (representing net royalties and lease and business asset fees.

172


-----

_Joint Venture Restaurants_

Certain of our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants, are operated through our
50/50 joint ventures with the Auchan Group, Agaquick and Agabk, which, together operate
25 restaurants. Agaquick has historically been focused on the conversion of Quick restaurants into the
Burger King brand, while Agabk is focused on the opening of new Burger King restaurants.

**Our Network**

**_Restaurant portfolio_**

As of June 30, 2021, we operated 399 Burger King restaurants and 11 Quick restaurants (not
including the two restaurants under conversion as of June 30, 2021) throughout all regions of France.
As of June 30, 2021, 83% of our Burger King restaurants were Franchise Restaurants and 17% were
Company Restaurants. We work with a total of 117 franchisees under the Burger King brand. Our
average franchisee operates 2.8 restaurants and our largest franchisee operates eight restaurants. We
also operate our restaurants across different formats and catchment areas including downtown areas,
shopping centers and drive-through facilities. Each type has its own business model and produces
different results overall. For example, on average, restaurants with drive-through facilities generate
approximately 40% of their sales from their drive-through facilities and are often more profitable than
other restaurant types as the rents are typically lower and require lower operating expenses. The table
below shows a breakdown of our network of restaurants in France by operating model and restaurant
type as of June 30, 2021:

**_Site selection_**

The activities described hereunder are undertaken in close cooperation with BH, an affiliate of
our principal shareholder, pursuant to a services agreement, with input from our management team and
certain employees. See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party
_Transactions”._

We consider the location of a restaurant to be critical to its long-term success and as such we
devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential locations for both Company
Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. We have developed a targeted site acquisition and
qualification process that incorporates our management’s experience as well as extensive data
collection, analysis and interpretation. Our restaurant development team has extensive experience
identifying and evaluating suitable restaurant locations. On average, the period from site selection to
the start of construction is approximately 18 months.

Our site selection process for both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants includes
extensive data collection, strategic mapping and competitive analysis. We seek new restaurant
locations based on specific criteria, such as intrinsic demographic characteristics and expected

173


-----

demographic trends relating to a potential location, the presence of one or several of our major
competitors or indirect competitors, the catchment area, the known success of other retail brands
already present in the area, the residential density thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the
potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. Each of these identification criteria is supported
by our developed know-how.

Following this initial “experience-based” assessment, our development and management
teams assess the development costs of each site based on various factors, including the site’s
complexity, size and location. The management team develops an estimate of the potential revenue for
each identified site based on known local market trends and conditions and relies on estimated data
such as the success rates of our major direct or indirect competitors in the vicinity. This enables our
development and management teams, who meet on a weekly basis, to assess the potential return on
investment and cash conversion rates of a restaurant at each new site identified. Thereafter
management makes a physical visit to a potential site before a final decision is made to adapt a specific
site. Our Managing Director and Deputy Managing Director are actively involved in the site selection
process.

Further work may be carried out on a potential site, including the appointment of marketing and
footfall consultants to assess customer flow and market factors. Our development and management
teams continue to compile and review information on a potential site up to the date a lease is signed. If
any negative information on the proposed site or area is discovered during this time, the management
team may choose not to proceed with developing a particular site.

**Development**

The activities described hereunder are undertaken in close cooperation with BH, an affiliate of
our principal shareholder, pursuant to a services agreement, with input from our management team and
certain employees. See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party
_Transactions”._

On average, 24 months is required from the identification of a site for a new Company
Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant until the new Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant is
ready to open for business. The majority of this time is dedicated to carrying out due diligence regarding
the potential site as described above and the negotiation and signing of a lease. This time period
includes the average time required to obtain the necessary permits and carry out pre-opening training
at the new location.

A significant portion of this process is related to obtaining the necessary construction permits
when we are planning to build a new restaurant. In our experience, obtaining a construction permit from
local authorities may take up to five months. While we are able to expedite this process under certain
circumstances, the preliminary approval process imposes a significant delay and must be completed
before we are able to begin other aspects of opening a new restaurant. However, the actual timeframe
for the development of a new Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant will vary based on site
specific considerations such as whether the location is newly constructed or converted from an existing
space. Management directly oversees each step of the development process that prepares a new
Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant for operation.

In 2020, we successfully developed one new Company Restaurant and 19 new Franchise
Restaurants under the Burger King brand. In addition, during 2020, we successfully converted nine
Quick restaurants to Burger King brand restaurants (of which four and five as Company Restaurants
and Franchise Restaurants respectively).

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we successfully developed 15 new Franchise
Restaurants under the Burger King brand. In addition, during the same period, we successfully

174


-----

converted 15 Quick restaurants to Burger King brand restaurants (of which one and 14 as Company
Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants respectively).

**_Opening New Burger King Restaurants_**

As part of our strategy, we plan to pursue expansion through organic growth by opening new
restaurants to operate under the Burger King brand, either as a Company Restaurant or a Franchise
Restaurant. Opening a new Burger King restaurant has a cost of approximately €2.4 million of capital
expenditure, including real estate and the costs the franchisees are responsible for (as further described
below), although these costs may vary across geographical regions. We may share such costs with our
franchisees depending on the type of franchise arrangement. In a Pure Franchise agreement, our
franchisees are solely responsible for all costs associated with opening a new restaurant. When one of
our Franchise with Lease Management partners opens a new restaurant, the franchisee is responsible
for the kitchen equipment, seating, lighting and some other decor-related features, which amounts to a
total of between €750,000 to €910,000. These costs exclude staff wages up until opening day,
recruitment costs, training costs, accommodation and transportation for staff and various marketing
initiatives in order to promote the opening which our franchisees incur in addition to their investment.
Capital expenditures that are not paid by the franchisees are totally or partially supported by the landlord
or a real estate company. Our asset light operating model allows us to develop and expand our network
without involving corporate capital expenditures, or where expenditures are necessary, limiting them to
some technical fittings and leasehold improvements.

Management has engaged with potential lenders, educating them about the case for lending to
Burger King franchisees in France. The consistently strong performance following the opening of a
Burger King restaurant helps to provide comfort to potential lenders and allows our franchisees easier
access to the necessary funds. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, we operated 399 restaurants under
the Burger King brand compared to approximately 1,500 restaurants for our main competitor,
McDonald’s (as of June 2021). In light of these figures, which demonstrate a strong market potential,
and as the master franchisee for the Burger King brand in France, we aim to further expand our Burger
King network in France, including through our franchise restaurants.

**_Restaurant monitoring and reporting_**

Our executive team, together with our regional directors, area managers and restaurant
managers, monitor the financial and operating performance of our Company Restaurants and Franchise
Restaurants at both sales and profit levels. The performance of our Franchise Restaurants is also
closely monitored by our franchisees, who are primarily responsible for monitoring the performance of
their respective Franchise Restaurant(s). We receive regular financial reporting by franchisees which
assists us in monitoring performance and forecasting new development in similar locations. In addition,
according to our franchise agreements, we have the right to review the financial information of our
Franchise Restaurants upon request.

We have implemented reporting procedures and IT systems that enable us to monitor the sales,
labor and food costs for each of our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants on a daily basis.
See “—Information Systems”. We actively manage underperforming Company Restaurants and
Franchise Restaurants by making operational changes (such as deploying new managers), and in the
case of our Company Restaurants, increasing local advertising to improve visibility of the location and
occasionally, incurring additional capital expenditures, such as refurbishment costs. Since our
inception, we have not closed a single Burger King Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant. One
Burger King was closed for relocation in the same commercial center.

**Group Operations**

**_Marketing, advertising and promotions_**

We believe that an effective marketing and advertising strategy is essential for the success of
our brands in France as marketing and advertising programs are a key traffic driver and enable us to
attract new customers to our restaurants and retain existing customers’ loyalty. In order to reinforce
awareness of the Burger King brand, build on our image and generate footfall, we invest annually in
innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns at the national level, essentially promoting
our new products. Our SWS and results of operations can be significantly affected by the frequency
and effectiveness of our advertising and promotional programs.

On September 23, 2021, Grand Prix Stratégies awarded us, along with our advertising agency
Buzzman, number one in most of the key categories of communication during the COVID-19 crisis,
including the Grand Prix Advertising and Special Grand Prix of the Jury awards for the “Burger King
and Friends” communication, the Grand Prix Media Strategy award for communication during the
pandemic and the Grand Prix Digital Communication award for our “Lockdown Burgers” program.
Burger King is the first brand to receive all of these awards simultaneously.

The terms of our franchise agreements require our Burger King franchisees to contribute 3.5%
of sales to our national advertising fund, which finances our marketing, advertising and promotions
initiatives and programs. In addition, franchisees must spend at least 1.5% of sales on advertising at
the local level in their respective markets. See “—Our Business—Restaurant operations”.

We use three levels of advertising: (i) system-wide advertising, which is coordinated and
centralized in our headquarters outside of Paris; (ii) digital and social media advertising; and (iii) local
advertising, which franchisees handle with materials we create or approve. Franchisees may not use
their own advertising materials without our prior consent. We must obtain BKC’s prior approval for all of
our marketing, advertising and promotional programs and initiatives.

_System-wide advertising programs_

Our Burger King Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants must contribute 3.5% of
sales to our coordinated and centralized system-wide advertising programs. We employ all manner of
media to reach our target audience, including families and young adults. We direct and retain sole
control over all advertising and promotions financed through contributions made by Company
Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. We use a national advertising agency to create our advertising
and promotional materials.

_Digital and social media advertising_

We currently use an extensive range of social media, television and digital marketing tools,
which we have prioritized and significantly developed in recent years. We create videos for sharing on
social media outlets such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, which we believe are the most
effective ways to reach our customers. In addition, we manage the development and maintenance of
the mobile Burger King app, which we have expanded to include additional features, including Click &
Collect in-app ordering and our customer loyalty program. We market Burger King products, services,
Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants through our website, www.burgerking.fr. Our website
features a site locator page showing the addresses and telephone numbers for each Company
Restaurant and Franchise Restaurant. We also advertise through search engine advertising in Google,
Yahoo and Bing.

176


-----

Burger King enjoys a strong brand image and presence in social media platforms, such as
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat. In a recent market study by IFOP,
Burger King had 91% total awareness and 83% spontaneous awareness among customers. We
regularly post information regarding new openings, promotions and new products, interact with
customers and answer queries from users.

We also focus our marketing efforts on digital multimedia advertising programs and outdoor
advertising displays, which we believe are the most effective way to reach our customers.

**_Procurement and logistics_**

_Raw materials supply_

All Burger King restaurants independently purchase supplies for their needs from approved
suppliers through our approved logistic partner(s). These purchases include food products and the
paper and packaging materials for the sale of our products as well as cleaning supplies and other
products for the maintenance of equipment.

Pursuant to our franchise agreements, Burger King operations are required to source raw
materials from BKC-approved suppliers. We are able to tap into the network of BKC-approved suppliers
both in France and in additional European markets, in particular Germany, the United Kingdom and
Austria, where approved suppliers in those countries have in the past, and are able to provide us with
approved raw materials on a regular basis, subject to their capacities. As we have expanded our
network of Burger King Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants, we have developed a
significant French network of approved suppliers, securing access to supplies while reducing transport
costs. The development of our network is beneficial to the overall success of the Burger King brand as
our suppliers will be able to source other Burger King markets in the event of a shortage or other
interruption in the supply chain. We anticipate that the locally sourced component of our raw materials
from French suppliers will continue to increase along with the growth of the Burger King network.

In order to improve and optimize our supply chain and achieve lower prices, we focus
particularly on implementing an efficient sourcing and food management policy through optimization of
the procurement process and product development at both the recipe level and overall product offer
level. We have developed relationships with a number of high-quality suppliers to source the ingredients
we need. We use a limited number of suppliers for each ingredient to obtain high volume discounts and
maximize the service level the business receives (backed up by contingency solutions) and only use a
small number of suppliers in order to control and guarantee quality. We also optimize food costs by
reducing waste and by focusing on food losses (for example, through our “Have it Your Way” model
and “made to order” model, through which customers can customize their menu items and food is
prepared only after a customer places an order, providing customers with fresh foods and limiting
waste).

We have implemented a purchasing strategy for raw materials which allows us to obtain price
commitments from suppliers by giving them mid- to long-term visibility on volumes and growth in France.
Moreover, we have entered into forward buying contracts with our suppliers, except for beef, which limit
our exposure to any short-term fluctuations in food prices. A typical forward buying contract provides
for fixed prices for at least six months. In addition, we entered into mid- to long-term contracts with our
strategic suppliers for beef, French fries, buns, chicken and beverages. This strategy allows us to have
pricing visibility and minimize the impact of fluctuations in food and supply prices on our operations for
the duration of these contracts.

Beef is a key ingredient in our product offerings. We have developed a dedicated strategy for
beef supply management optimization in order to mitigate the effect of the global upward pricing trend
on the beef market. The purchase of beef accounted from approximately 20 to 25% of our raw material

177


-----

costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we have a limited number of beef suppliers
(eight approved suppliers as of 2020) which are strictly required to purchase beef only from EU
approved establishments and a limited number of countries of origin (France, Germany and Austria).
Our beef is exclusively sourced from Europe, more than 50% of which comes from France.

We intend to continue to select our suppliers and track our raw material sourcing using very
strict processes, which include supplier selection criteria based on quality control, financial situation,
production capacity (ability to handle both large volumes and flexible production), emergency back-up
capabilities, as well as strength in research and development.

_Logistics_

For the Burger King brand, procurement and logistics activities are outsourced and handled by
QSL-STEF, a joint venture of QSL and STEF dedicated to the QSR sector. QSL-STEF purchases our
food supplies and other raw materials from various suppliers. We contractually set certain targets and
goals with QSL-STEF, which monitors our inventories and packaging in addition to ensuring that goods
and materials reach our restaurants from their point of origin at an optimal cost and service level.
Franchisees order their raw materials and supplies directly from QSL-STEF as an approved vendor.

QSL-STEF serves as a third-party and fourth-party logistics provider for us, coordinating the
logistics of our third-party providers and is also responsible for the warehousing and related storage
from the suppliers. Under the terms of agreements with the suppliers, QSL-STEF becomes the owner
of these products once they reach third-party warehouses with whom it has contracted to provide such
warehousing services. Storage and distribution of food items and operational supplies to all restaurants
(Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants) is subcontracted to a third-party logistics provider
(STEF).

As we rely on QSL-STEF for coordinating logistics for all of our restaurants, we are able to
negotiate favorable terms as a block and provide our Franchise Restaurants with the ability to achieve
preferential price points, improving their overall results of operations. Our team in our headquarters
located at Clichy, France monitors the logistics and distribution to our Company Restaurants.

**_Product Offering_**

Our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants offer extensive menus specializing in
hamburger and cheeseburger sandwiches primarily made with beef (including the signature
WHOPPER[®] sandwich) or featuring chicken breast or fish sandwiches, most of which are made to
order. We also offer a limited range of chicken nuggets and chicken wings. Our menu includes French
fries, onion rings, freshly prepared salads, breakfast options, soft drinks, milk shakes, ice cream and
other desserts, coffee, tea and kids’ meals. In recent years, we have further developed and improved
our product range to better respond to changing consumer preferences through the launch of gourmet
burgers with premium ingredients, plant-based burger options and additional healthy menu items such
as fresh bowls.

Our price positioning seeks to be competitive with our main competitor, McDonald’s, but adds
more extensive “premiumization” options through high quality ingredients or additional toppings. Our
product offering and price point is comparable to those of our main competitor, McDonald’s. While we
have a more expansive premium offering than our main competitor, we pride ourselves on offering a
wide range of products comparable to our competitors’ offering.

We also test new products on an ongoing basis and develop geographical variations and
specific sandwiches for the French market. In addition, our restaurants sell a variety of promotional
products for a limited time only. When we decide to add a new product to our menu, we must use BKC
approved suppliers for the ingredients. If we decide to permanently add a new product to our menu, we

178


-----

are required to obtain BKC’s authorization. For limited time offerings, however, we are not required to
obtain such authorization.

**_Innovation and Product Development_**

Innovation is at the core of our strategy and directly affects the products and services we offer
our customers in order to meet their expectations. Quality, choice and nutrition are increasingly
important to our customers and we are continuously evaluating and evolving our menu to meet our
customers’ needs. Our “Have it Your Way” model allows customers the ability to customize our menu
items to order only the ingredients they want to eat. Beyond the menu we offer our customers, we also
innovate on production processes and methods in our kitchens, invest in new equipment and optimize
work organization in order to deliver the best dining experience to our customers. For example, our
broiler system provides our hamburgers with a unique flavor that promotes our products and
differentiates us from our main competitor.

We are also focused on accelerating our innovation in terms of digital convenience options for
our customers. For example, in 2020 we launched a new Burger King app with the ability to order Click
& Collect directly through the app, as well as improved the drive-through digital experience by
accelerating the order process through the use of digital tablets in our drive-through sites. In the same
year, we also launched Kingdom, a new digital loyalty program, allowing customers to earn rewards
through their purchases, which they are able to accumulate through scanner capabilities for easy
customer identification. In 2019 and 2020, we have also expanded food delivery options through our
partnerships for delivery services with Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. We are also in the process of
rolling out geolocalized table service in our restaurants, allowing dine-in customers to receive their
meals directly at their table.

**_Support to our Franchisees_**

As franchisor, we aim to support, promote and encourage our franchisees both before the
opening of their restaurants and throughout the course of their operations and provide them with
numerous support services. As franchisor, the relationships formed with franchisees and the interaction
between us, our franchisees and end-customers throughout the course of the value chain, are intended
to increase franchisees’ sales. We believe that our model helps our franchisees to realize positive net
returns.

_Service, delivery and pricing_

Franchisees are provided with extensive materials and training on how to organize, manage
and monitor service delivery in their restaurants, including best practices that have been developed by
BKC for worldwide use. For example, our manuals assist franchisees in organizing the taking and
dispatch of orders, for in-restaurant dining, take-away and drive-through, and work force scheduling
management during peak hours. Additionally, we recommend prices using a tiered approach for all
products, though franchisees are independent entrepreneurs and are free to adjust their pricing as local
conditions or their own business reasons may dictate.

_Training, pre-opening assistance and ongoing support_

Franchisees (along with their manager(s)) must attend and successfully complete a training
program before we will issue an opening date for a Franchise Restaurant. Our training program covers
various topics, including: Burger King culture, food preparation and storage, food safety, specific
position training, uniforms, cleaning and sanitation, marketing and advertising, point-of-sale systems,
accounting and hospitality, among others. We require our franchisees to live within one hour of their
respective restaurant(s) and require them to hire a restaurant manager who either resides in the area
where the restaurant is located or is willing to move to this area.

179


-----

When a franchisee opens his or her first Franchise Restaurant, we provide the franchisee with
certain operational support during the initial operating days including training employees and providing
guidance and tips for operating a restaurant in compliance with our standards. We also provide lists of
approved inventory, suppliers and small-wares that are needed to stock and operate each restaurant
and help franchisees locate qualified suppliers of raw materials and other supplies and ingredients that
meet our specifications.

We maintain programs to monitor and evaluate the adherence of Franchise Restaurants to our
quality, service and cleanliness standards. We also closely monitor financial data of each Franchise
Restaurant, including revenue, sales and profits. In addition, we are responsible for communicating and
conveying certain initiatives and process enhancements to our franchisees and conducting business
reviews in order to assist franchisees to operate more efficiently, increase the Franchise Restaurant’s
performance, sales and profits and stimulate Franchise Restaurant’s footfall and visibility. See “—Our
_Network—Restaurant monitoring and reporting”._

In addition to our hands-on training and assistance, we provide an operations manual to each
restaurant location that addresses business operations, food safety, crew, hospitality, quality products,
guest services, packaging and presentation, restaurant cleaning, restaurant and equipment
maintenance, point-of-sale systems, quality control, advertising and marketing and emergency
management. See “—Quality Assurance and Food Safety”.

_Point-of-sale system_

We require our franchisees to use a unique proprietary third-party restaurant software
developed exclusively for Burger King and that allows us to track sales at each Franchise Restaurant
location. Furthermore, a point-of-sale system provides our franchisees with additional back office tools
that we believe assist in cost control, create operational efficiencies and drive sales.

_Supply chain assistance_

We and our franchisees rely on QSL-STEF to manage our supply chain and provide us with
the necessary raw materials, commodities and other items needed to develop and operate our
restaurants. We coordinate directly with QSL-STEF to manage the supply chain as it relates to our
Company Restaurants and our franchisees work directly with QSL-STEF to manage their own supply
chain. See “Business—Group Operations—Procurement and Logistics”.

_Research and development_

We benefit from and rely on the product development capabilities of our Burger King network
to drive sales. While we may test certain limited time offers in our own market to gauge consumer
interest and reaction, we are able to benefit from the strong global product development that Burger
King generates for the benefit of its restaurant network. See “—Innovation and Product Development”.

**_Quality Assurance and Food Safety_**

We have implemented detailed quality assurance, food safety and sanitary procedures at all
stages within our supply chain and in our restaurants to ensure the quality and consistency of the
products sold at our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants and to protect and enhance the
Burger King brand image. We benefit from BKC’s strong experience and knowledge of quality
assurance and food safety standards and procedures.

180


-----

In order to ensure that high quality standards are maintained and to adhere to BKC’s standards
and procedures on quality assurance and food safety, we have developed a strong hygiene culture and
have established a reliable control track record, with stringent standards which can even go beyond the
requirements under French legal regulations. Such standards apply to all our Burger King restaurants.
See “Regulation” for a description of the laws and regulations that govern food safety and hygiene in
our operations. No food contamination incident has been attributed to our restaurants since Groupe
Bertrand (through Burger King France) entered into the Master Franchise Agreement or acquired the
Quick brand. Our quality control department is fully dedicated to monitoring and enforcing quality
assurance and food safety standards and procedures and managing any quality or food safety issue
across our entire supply chain from production, to transportation and storage to end-delivery.

We have implemented a detailed food safety manual that covers all aspects of cleaning, food
handling and storage, pest control, stock control and waste disposal. We also have rigorous food safety
procedures based on a hazard analysis and critical control points plan, which includes controls and
monitoring for key processes such as receiving food deliveries, defrosting, cooking, cooling and storage.
This includes stringent guidelines on date labelling, allergen labelling, refrigerator plans and
temperature checks. In addition, we use specific cleaning products to maintain hygiene and food safety
and we communicate an allergen list through leaflets, posters in restaurants and on our website. Any
breach of our quality assurance and food safety rules by a restaurant is sanctioned and is factored into
the restaurant manager’s compensation. For Franchise Restaurants, non-compliance with our quality
assurance and food safety rules is grounds for termination under our franchise agreements. We review
our safety governance policy on an ongoing basis at the restaurant, area and group level.

All restaurant employees receive training on critical aspects of food safety as part of their hiring
process and also complete a food safety course. Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants
team members receive ongoing training regarding sanitary procedures, and all senior personnel and
managers are required to complete food safety qualifications administered by us. Senior operations
management may also seek to attain further food safety qualifications.

We inspect both our Company Restaurants and our Franchise Restaurants on a quarterly basis.
We perform audits on the procedures in place in Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants to
ensure that food is being correctly handled. In addition, we have a contract with an independent lab to
perform bacteriological tests in our restaurants. BKC also conducts inspections on a quarterly basis in
order to verify that its requirements are being respected. We consider adherence to our food safety
policy to be one of our top priorities and may terminate our relationships with franchisees who fail to
respect these standards. Further, failure to comply with food safety requirements may be grounds for
termination of the Master Franchise Agreement.

**Real Estate**

Under our historic Pure Franchise agreements, we did not systematically directly lease the real
estate underlying Franchise Restaurants. In connection with the continued development of the Burger
King brand in France, we have decided to enter into Franchise with Lease Management agreements
with our franchisees going forward to streamline our operating structure by using one contractual
arrangement with all of our franchisees that provides us with greater control over our network.

As of June 30, 2021, 277 of our Burger King Franchise Restaurants were operated under lease
management arrangements. Under this scheme, we remain the owner of the business assets rights
(fonds de commerce) and leasehold rights, while the franchisee is the owner of all equipment and
signage that they purchase in connection with operating the restaurant. As we are the tenant of record
with respect to the restaurant real estate, this arrangement allows us to limit the possibility of losing a
location within our network to a competitor without our consent. We then enter into an agreement with
the franchisee to sign a lease management agreement, who in turn pays us a percentage of sales in
rent payments while we directly pay the landlord. These locations are leased under commercial lease
agreements (baux commerciaux) that we enter into with the landlords. For a brief description of the

181


-----

principal terms of our commercial lease agreements, see “—Restaurant operations—Franchise
_Restaurants—Franchise with Lease Management”._

We lease the real estate of our Company Restaurants from third parties. All Company
Restaurants are subject to commercial leases or ground leases. The following provides a brief
description of these arrangements.

Commercial leases have a minimum initial duration of nine years to twelve years. The lessee
has the right to terminate a commercial lease at the end of each three-year period. The lessor may only
terminate the lease at the conclusion of each three-year period in certain limited circumstances. At the
end of the contractual term of the lease, the lessee is entitled to a renewal. If the lessor refuses such
renewal, the lessor will be required to compensate the lessee, unless the lessor can show good cause.
Upon expiration of the lease agreement, if the lessor and lessee take no action to renew or to terminate
the lease, the original lease will be automatically renewed until either the lessor or the lessee serves a
notice of termination. An automatically renewed lease may be terminated at any time by either the lessor
or the lessee provided that six months’ prior notice is given. In addition to our commercial leases, we
maintain certain ground leases for some of our older properties which have a typical duration of
30 years.

The parties to a commercial lease are free to determine the initial rent, generally according to
the current market value of the property at the signing of the contract. The rent may be fixed, variable
or composed of a fixed portion and a variable portion. Generally, the lease contains an annual rent
indexation clause. The agreed index must have some connection with the activity carried out by one of
the parties or to the purpose of the lease. The majority of our leases are based on the Commercial Rent
Index (ILC) (indice des loyers commerciaux) published by _l’Institut national de la statistique et des_
_études économiques (INSEE), the French public statistics institute._

**Our Employees**

As of June 30, 2021, we directly employed 2,695 full-time equivalent employees (excluding
Quick’s operations and excluding franchisees employees). As franchisees are independent business
owners, they and their employees are not included in our employee count. We believe that we provide
working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our major competitors. We
consider our relationship with our employees to be strong.

In France, a collective bargaining framework agreement is in place for the QSR sector that sets,
among other things, annual working times, employee holiday time and overtime pay and employee
leaving conditions. In addition, there is a limited number of trade unions that are recognized as
representatives and given the legal authority to appoint trade union delegates, and to negotiate
additional company-specific collective bargaining agreements. Some of our employees are members
of these trade unions.

We place significant emphasis on staff training, which we believe is key to maintaining high
standards of quality across our business. We provide comprehensive in-house training to all employees,
which we extend to Franchise Restaurant staff through a number of training initiatives to actively support
and foster employee development and retention at Franchise Restaurants. Our training focuses on
health and safety issues for restaurant-based employees, and we also provide food-hygiene training
and food retail management to managers of both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants.

In addition, we regularly encourage our franchisees and their employees to visit our Company
Restaurants in order to demonstrate new equipment, menu items, workflow practices and ensure that
all franchisees and their employees are trained to a consistent standard. We also encourage in-house
promotion of employees through training and development where possible.

**ESG & Sustainability**

Our corporate, social and environmental responsibility is a top priority for our management. We
have established a number of goals and initiatives to ensure responsible operations and to create a
healthy and safe future for people and the environment. Our ESG initiatives are built on three key pillars:
(i) the quality and safety of our products, (ii) our strong and committed teams and (iii) the protection of
our planet through the reduction of our environmental impacts.

**_Quality and safety of Our Products_**

Our customers demand high-quality food products, and we intend to provide best-in-class
products and services to our customers by continuing to focus on quality, both through quality control
and production of ingredients that promote a clean environment. We therefore source a wide range of
ingredients locally from France. As of June 30, 2021, 75% of the food products we purchase come from
French agri-food companies, as compared to 10% five years ago. Further, our beef is exclusively
sourced from Europe, more than 50% of which comes from France, and our nuggets are exclusively
sourced in France, from poultry born and raised in compliance with programs that promote the
environment and respect for animal welfare. In addition, 100% of our potatoes for fries, flour for buns
and fresh onions are sourced from France, as well as the raw vegetables and fruits included in our
children’s menus, which are 100% organic and sourced from France.

We further aim to minimize the footprint of our products with a focus on our ingredients and
product offerings. Through our ingredients, we are committed to providing seasonal fruits, MSC-certified
fish, and organic ingredients in kid meals. We believe driving the adoption of meatless proteins is one
of the most impactful ways that we can contribute to the reduction in the carbon footprint of our industry.
As a result, we started developing and marketing plant-based offerings and currently offer 7 meatless
protein products.

Providing our customers with healthy dining options is at the heart of our food innovation
philosophy. We have focused on implementing policies to protect consumer health, including through
improving the nutritional profile and ingredients of our products and developing product ranges for
specific nutritional requirements. We have achieved significant results in recent years by implementing
improvements across many of our ingredients and dishes. For example, we are committed to sugar and
salt reduction. In 2019, we reduced the level of sugar in our drinks by 6%, and in 2020, we reduced the
level of salt in our potatoes by 50%. Further, we have been palm oil free since 2019. We have also
eliminated artificial colors, flavors and preservatives throughout all our menus and meal options.
Moreover, we also continue to invest in customer choice, by proposing new products in order to satisfy
most of our clients’ tastes such as low calorie salads, wraps, vegan and vegetarians options. Since our
products are developed in France, we have guaranteed our customers access to nutritional information,
as well as information on product allergens on our site, our application and in restaurants to allow
customers to make an informed choice within our offer.

Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to help ensure that our
customers enjoy safe, quality food products by conducting strict internal control over food safety across
our network. We maintain strict controls over the food supply chain to guarantee product safety,
regulatory compliance and to assure the quality standards of our restaurants. For these purposes, we
have implemented supplier controls, production controls and a system of food safety verification. For
example, raw materials are controlled by an external laboratory to ensure proper compliance with all
food safety criteria. We are also able to trace the distribution of raw materials from our production
facilities or suppliers. We have implemented rigorous control protocols over all our restaurants, which
are subject to bi-monthly hygiene audits performed by an external independent accredited laboratory.
We provide continuous food handling and safety training to our employees in order to ensure the
consistency and safety of product offerings in our network.

**_Strong and committed teams_**

We have a longstanding commitment in favor of gender equality and diversity. In 2020, 51% of
our employees were women. Since 2019, the Penicaud index, a gender equality index introduced under
the French law no. 2019-15 of January 8, 2019, has applied to all companies in France with more than
50 employees. The index provides an optimal score of 100, calculated on the basis of five indicators,
including, for example, the gender pay gap and differences in distribution of individual salary increases.
In 2020, our Burger King France operations achieved a Penicaud index score greater than 85, above
the compliance threshold of 75. We aim to maintain this equality in the future and to prioritize gender
equality in our management teams in our branch restaurants. We have also adopted a policy for
harassment and bullying at work in our restaurants, as well as an incident reporting platform to address
such occurrences.

We recognize the importance of inclusion and consider the diversity of our team as one of our
greatest strengths. Therefore, we focus on growing employment for individuals with disabilities to
promote inclusion. As a result of changing French regulations, we now use a new calculation method
for our employment rate of workers with disabilities. In 2019, we had an employment rate ratio of 5.2%.
Using the new calculation, in 2020, our percentage decreased to 3.2% which is compared to 2.6% on
average for the restaurant sector in France. This has been a driving force in our decision to redeploy a
more ambitious inclusion policy.

Training is the cornerstone of our operational excellence. We provide continuous investment in
our training teams. For example, we require a minimum of 50 hours of training per employee, 9 weeks
for managers and 18 weeks for directors to offer career growth, retain talent and maintain high service
quality. We also invest in the future by targeting 80% of our managers through internal promotions.

**_Reduction of environmental impacts_**

We strive to minimize our impact on the environment. Our environmental initiatives are built on
three key pillars: the reduction of the impact of (i) our real estate footprint, (ii) our waste and (iii) our
logistics. To mitigate our real estate footprint we have used PEFC-certified wooden frames for all new
buildings since 2019. Furthermore, we participate in trial initiatives, for example, rooftop energy
collection, CO2 cooling, optimized lighting and car charging points.

We are committed to reducing waste and implementing eco-friendly packaging. Our
environmentally-friendly packaging has helped us avoid approximately 700 tons per year of plastic
waste. To this end, we have banned our usage of single-use plastic from our service packaging in favor
of paper solutions. Our kids cups are now plastic-free and compostable. In addition, since 2020, toys
are no longer systematically distributed with kids menus, leading to 10% of such menus being sold
without any toys. Since 2021, we have gradually removed plastic from our toys, and we aim to become
full plastic free in 2022.

In addition, we have deployed a plan to massively reduce waste with the objective of avoiding
1,700 tons of waste per year. For example, we have replaced the boxes of our kids menus and delivery
boxes with bags that represented half their weight. We have introduced packaging systems that do not
require a lid and we have also reduced the size of our cashier’s receipts. Furthermore, we began waste
sorting in 2020, and selective waste collection initiatives in 2021.

Moreover, we are committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the fight against
climate change. For example, in 2019 we optimized our truck load by improving the filling rate of our
trucks for a 15% reduction in route mileage. This allows our truck fleet to meet a strict criteria in terms
of polluting gas emissions (in line with the Euro 6 European emissions standards). Our target is to
reduce vehicle-related CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance coverage under various liability and property insurance policies for,
among other things, damages in the areas of operations, environmental liabilities and business
interruption. Our fixed assets, such as technical equipment used in distribution, stocking, information
technology and office equipment, are covered by a bundled industrial insurance policy (damages from
fire, catastrophes, theft, flood and severe weather) that includes business interruption insurance when
business interruption is caused by an insured property damage. We also maintain various insurance
policies covering legal services, transportation, accidents and motor vehicles, as well as a directors’
and officers’ liability insurance. We believe that the level of insurance we maintain is appropriate for the
risks of our business and is comparable to that maintained by other companies in our markets operating
in the same business lines. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our current insurance
_may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed”._

**Information Systems**

We rely on a number of information systems to provide management, analytical and
performance evaluation tools that assist management at all levels to undertake critical business
processes. Our information systems are highly integrated, covering most of our fundamental business
service areas, including point-of-sale terminals, purchases and logistics, finance, quality control,
marketing and human resources, and providing us with sufficiently robust data processing ability to
efficiently manage our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. In addition, these capabilities
allow us to integrate new and converted Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants to our
network in order to achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies. One of our most
important and widely used tools is our point-of-sale systems, which is installed at all of our Company
Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants.

We believe that our information system is robust, adequate to support our activities and insured
to standards that are comparable to other operators in our industry.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to various legal proceedings involving routine claims that are incidental to our
business. Although our legal and financial liabilities with respect to such proceedings cannot be
estimated with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings, individually or
in the aggregate, will be materially adverse to our business, financial position or results of operations.
See “Risk factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face risks of litigation and negative publicity
_from customers, franchisees, suppliers and employees”._

185


-----

**REGULATION**

We are subject to various laws and regulations administered by local, national and other
government entities in France, as well as at the European Union level. Our business is particularly
affected by laws and regulations regarding food safety and hygiene and food labeling requirements.
Additionally, we are subject to labor and employment laws as well as franchise regulations.

**Food and Beverage Regulations**

Food safety is an integral part of our business as a food services provider. Serving food that is
safe and that has been prepared and distributed in accordance with applicable regulations is an
underlying prerequisite for our customers, and is the fundamental basis for the trust that they place in
us. Our business is subject to extensive local, regional and national laws and other requirements
relating to food safety, hygiene and nutrition standards in each of the countries in which we operate, as
well as at the EU level for our operations in Europe. We have implemented several measures which we
believe ensure compliance with applicable food and beverage regulations, including providing training
to employees in food safety, contamination prevention, food preparation and storage, facilities
maintenance and pest control.

**_Food safety and hygiene_**

_European Union_

The reform of the EU regulations on food hygiene, which came into force on January 1, 2006,
simplified and harmonized the previously existing food hygiene legislation applicable in the European
Union. The reformed set of regulations, known as the “Hygiene Package”, concerns the entire food
chain, from primary production (both animal and plant) to the consumer, and includes the food industry,
transport and distribution (“from farm to fork”). Its aim is to standardize the level of food safety by
involving all stakeholders in the food chain and subjecting them to uniform requirements, by formalizing
the requirements of food-industry professionals and optimizing enforcement by the health authorities.
Food safety and hygiene regulations and directives promulgated by the EU have an impact on our
business because we conduct substantially all of our activities in France, which is a member state of
the EU. The main food safety regulator at the EU level is the European Food Safety Authority (the
“EFSA”), which was established in 2002 by Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, as amended and
supplemented (the “General Food Law Regulation”), which is the key text of the Hygiene Package.
The EFSA assesses and communicates risks associated with the food chain in order to inform the
policies and decisions of food safety risk managers.

The General Food Law Regulation lays down the general principles and requirements of food
safety legislation to be implemented into national law by all member states of the EU. In particular, the
General Food Law Regulation requires food business operators to ensure that businesses under their
control satisfy relevant requirements and to verify that such requirements are met at all stages of
production, processing and distribution. It also imposes a mandatory traceability requirement along the
entire food chain that applies to all food and all types of operators in the processing, transportation,
storage, distribution and retail stages, among others. Each food operator is required to register and
keep for a reasonable period of time (the guidance of the Standing Committee states that five years is
a reasonable time) detailed product information (including the name and address of the producer, the
nature of the product and the transaction date) and make such records immediately available to
competent authorities upon request.

As part of the Hygiene Package, we are also subject to other specific European food hygiene
legislation under Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 of April 29, 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, which
applies to all food businesses, and defines general hygiene rules applicable to all foodstuffs, and to
Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 of April 29, 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for the hygiene of

186


-----

foodstuffs of animal origin (together, the “EU Hygiene Regulations”). The EU Hygiene Regulations
require that we obtain and maintain hazard analysis and critical control point (“HACCP”) certification,
including instructing employees in this regard and conducting appropriate record-keeping. HACCP is a
systematic preventive approach used in the food industry to identify potential food safety hazards, so
that key actions (known as critical control points) may be taken to reduce or eliminate risks, while
considering all key aspects of product manufacturing, from the safety of the raw materials, to process
validation (for example, cooking and washing), to shelf life and finally end-consumer usage. In addition,
the EU Hygiene Regulations include more stringent requirements for food products of animal origin,
such as meat, fish and dairy products, and food containing such products. European legislation
regulates the temperature settings at which these products must be kept as well as the length of time
for which they can be displayed. A number of subsequent regulations that serve as implementing texts
of the Hygiene Package have also been enacted, certain of which are applicable in our operations.
These regulations lay out specific criteria and requirements for compliance with the Hygiene Package,
as well as consequences for non-compliance.

_France_

In France, the principal food safety regulator is the Agency for Food, Environment and
Occupational Health and Safety (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de
_l’environnement et du travail, or the “ANSES”). The ANSES provides the relevant authorities with the_
necessary expertise in order to set national-level regulations concerning, among other subjects: hygiene
rules applicable to the retailing, storage and transport of products of animal origin and food containing
such products; technical and hygiene conditions applicable to the transport of foodstuffs; and licensing
of establishments that bring to market products of animal origin or food containing such products. In
addition, French food safety regulation requires each establishment that brings to market products of
animal origin or food containing such products to obtain an official authorization. Further, we are subject
to several provisions of the French Rural and Maritime Fishing Code (Code rural et de la pêche
_maritime), as amended, dealing, among others, with food safety epidemiology concerns related to_
products of animal origin and animal feed, and animal health.

**_Food Labelling and Nutrition_**

Food labelling, particularly as it relates to nutritional content, involves the accurate and precise
labelling of the energy and nutritional content of a food product on its product packaging. It is an
increasingly regulated tool that is intended to help customers in their food choices and to support public
health policy measures.

Our products are subject to Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of October 25, 2011 on the
provision of information to customers (the “Food Labelling Regulation”), which replaced and
consolidated into one piece of legislation previous labelling rules deriving from Directive 2000/13/EC
regarding labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition
labelling of foodstuffs, and other legislative acts for specific categories of foods.

The Food Labelling Regulation, which introduced key changes such as mandatory nutrition
disclosure on processed foods and amendments to nutrition labelling format, entered into force on
December 13, 2014 (save for the obligation to provide nutrition information applicable from
December 13, 2016). Successive amendments to the Food Labelling Regulations, including various EU
and French implementation regulations, have since been adopted on various subjects, including the
indication of the country of origin for certain types of meat and other ingredients, nutritional and health
claims made with respect to food products and the labeling of additional vitamins, minerals and other
substances in food ingredients. For example, Regulation (EU) 2018/775 lays down rules for the
application of Article 26(3) of the Food Labelling Regulation. It sets out guidelines for indicating the
country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food product, providing that if the
origin or provenance of a product’s primary ingredient is different to the origin or provenance currently
indicated on the label of a food, food services providers will have to provide additional information on

187


-----

packaging regarding the origin of the primary ingredient or ingredients. The purpose of this regulation
is to ensure that customers are not misled about the origin of a product’s ingredients.

In recent years, national and local authorities have begun reinforcing such food labelling
regulations and requirements motivated by concerns regarding nutrition and environmental
sustainability. These measures have included, among others, greater emphasis on food labelling and
disclosure of nutritional content, requirements to utilize recyclable packaging materials, and additional
taxes on food and beverage items with high sugar content. For example, specific French legislation
regulates the labelling of beef in restaurant establishments (Decree no. 2002-1465 of December 17,
2002). In addition, there has been increasing regulatory scrutiny over the disclosure of allergens present
in prepared food products. For example, French legislation (Decree No. 2015-447 of April 17, 2015)
regulates consumer information on allergens. Pursuant to such regulation, allergenic substances
present in both prepackaged and non-prepackaged products must be pointed out in the list of
ingredients.

In the coming years, we expect additional regulations pertaining to food labelling to be enacted.
For example, the European Commission is contemplating the introduction of uniform mandatory
nutrition labelling laws for the front of food packaging by the end of 2022, in addition to the mandatory
labelling already imposed on the back of food packaging. The proposed labelling could take a form
analogous to the Nutri-Score used today in France. Under the current timetable for the European
Commission’s “Green Deal”, regulations are expected to set maximum levels of certain nutrients in food
products and to establish uniform nutritional profiles by the end of 2021, as well as to limit certain
communication around products rich in sugar, salt and fat by 2022.

**_Beverage Tax_**

In France, the draft budget law for 2012 dated December 28, 2011 introduced a tax (the
“Beverage Tax”) on all beverages containing added-sugar substances or one or more artificial
sweeteners (articles 1613 ter and 1613 quater of the French tax code). The law enacting the Beverage
Tax came into force on January 1, 2012. The Beverage Tax, initially set at €7.16 per hundred liters, is
reassessed annually based on the consumer price index (excluding tobacco) and must be paid by any
person or entity located in France that makes the first delivery of such beverages in France, either
because it produces the beverages, or because it imports or purchases them from any person or entity
located outside of France, whether or not for consideration. The Beverage Tax was amended by the
draft social security financing law for 2018, which was adopted on October 27, 2017, in order to link the
amount of Beverage Tax to be paid to the quantity of added-sugar substances contained in such
beverages. Since then, the amounts have been reassessed each year. As of June 12, 2021, the rate of
tax on beverages containing added-sugar is determined according to a progressive scale which ranges
from €3.11 per hundred liters for one kilogram or less of added-sugar per hundred liters, to €24.34 for
a beverage containing 15 kilograms of added-sugar per hundred liters. For beverages containing over
15 kilograms of added-sugar per hundred liters, the tax is increased by €2.07 per additional kilogram of
added-sugar. In addition, as of June 12, 2021, all beverages containing one or more artificial
sweeteners are subject to a tax of €3.11 per hundred liters. Certain of our products are subject to the
Beverage Tax.

**_Other food service-felated regulations_**

Restaurant facilities are also subject to regulations promulgated by national, regional and local
authorities covering a range of matters such as the utilization and maintenance of restaurant sites and
equipment and waste storage and disposal. We are also required to enforce anti-smoking laws for
dining establishments.

_Regulations against waste and the circular economy_

In July 2014, the European Commission published the so-called “waste package”, aimed at
amending several EU directives (i.e., four directives amended on May 30, 2018) and at introducing new
waste targets, with the focus on resource efficiency and a circular economy. To transpose this directive,
France passed Law no. 2020-105 on February 10, 2020. This new law, which fights against waste and
the circular economy, introduced new measures aiming to encourage reuse and recycling and improve
consumer information on environmental attributes of products and their packaging (the “AGEC Law”).
Furthermore, the AGEC law confirms and extends the role of extended producer responsibility (“EPR”).
The EPR requires producers, importers and distributors of products to either provide or financially
contribute to the management of the waste generated by their products.

_Regulation for the reduction of the use of certain single-use plastic products_

The European Parliament and the Council of June 5, 2019 published Directive 2019/904 (the
“Single-Use Plastics Directive”). The Single-Use Plastics Directive promotes approaches that favor
sustainable and non-toxic re-usable products and re-use systems instead of single-use products.
Furthermore, the European Commission has published guidance on single-use plastics products to
ensure uniformity in implementing the Single-Use Plastics Directive across the European Union.

In France, the AGEC law aims to end the use of single-use plastic packaging by 2040. Plastic
cups and plates were banned beginning on January 1, 2020. Plastic straws, confetti, cutlery and
polystyrene take-away boxes were banned beginning on January 1, 2021. In addition, as of
January 1, 2023, fast-food restaurants will be obliged to use reusable tableware for the meals and
drinks consumed on site by their customers. The AGEC extended the EPR sector to cover toys in
France. Plastic toys are often offered in the catering sector with some of their menus. However, the
plastic toys are not recyclable and often end up in the waste bin. Therefore, as of January 1, 2022, the
law provides for the prohibition of plastic toys supplied with some kids menus. As a result, plastic toys
are expected to be made optional in kids menus.

_Selective sorting regulation_

In addition, in France, Decree no. 2016-288 of March 10, 2016, governs waste management in
the workplace. This requires selective sorting according to the five streams identified in the regulation.
The five streams include types of recyclable waste (paper, metal, plastic, glass and wood) that must be
sorted by all companies that generate and hold such waste in France. In particular, the fast-food sector
is subject to the regulation of all five streams. This requires the fast-food establishment to sort the waste
according to its nature. To this end, establishments will have to equip their French sites with selective
sorting stations.

**Franchise Regulation**

In France, the franchisor is legally obligated to provide prospective franchisees, or current
franchisees contemplating the opening of a new restaurants, with information regarding the franchise
under a “pre-contractual information document” (“PID”) pursuant to Article L. 330-3 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce) (formerly Article 1 of the Law no. 89-1008 of December 31,
1989 called “Loi Doubin”) as supplemented by Article R. 330-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code
_de commerce) (formerly Article 1 of the implementing Decree no. 91-337 of April 4, 1991) (collectively,_
the “Franchise Law”).

The franchisor must provide full and accurate information regarding the franchise to allow the
prospective franchisee to make an informed decision with respect to the franchise. Under the Franchise
Law, the PID must contain certain prescribed information, including the history of the company, the
state and prospects of development of the relevant market, the importance of network operators, the

189


-----

duration of the franchise contract, conditions for renewal and termination, franchise assignability and

**Data Protection**

**_European Union_**

As part of our regular operations, we process customers’ personal data, through our mobile
Burger King app, but also as part of our loyalty program. Therefore, as a data controller, we have
implemented privacy policies and IT solutions to ensure compliant processing of personal data.

The GDPR sets out the general framework for the European data privacy regime. Under the
GDPR, the definition of personal data includes information such as name, identification number, e-mail
address, location data, online identifiers such as Internet protocol addresses and cookie identifiers, or
any other type of information that can identify a natural person.

The GDPR sets out, among others, the following key principles and obligations that apply to
the Group and its operations:

    - Lawfulness: any use/processing of personal data requires a specific legal basis. Use of
personal data is permissible, for example: to the extent this is required to perform a
contract; if the individual has given its consent; or if the organization has a legitimate
interest.

    - Fairness and proportionality: processing of personal data must be fair, proportionate and
compatible with the purpose for which the data were collected.

    - Transparency: individuals must be informed about the processing of their personal data.

    - Security: adequate technical and organizational measures need to be implemented to
ensure the security of personal data.

    - Storage limitation: personal data may not be retained for longer than necessary and should
be deleted after such period.

    - Data subject rights: individuals have several rights under the GDPR such as a:

      - right to access (obtain a copy of their personal data);

190


-----

      - right to rectify any incorrect personal data;

      - right to request erasure of any personal data when no longer needed;

      - right to data portability (receive the personal data in a structured format so it can be
used by another service provider); and

      - right to object to the use of personal data on in particular situations.

    - Use of third-party service providers: in the event the personal data is processed by a service
provider (data processor) on behalf of a data controller, this processing needs to be
governed by a contract between the data controller and the data processor. Such contract
must include certain mandatory clauses, such as for example on the subject-matter and
duration of the processing; the right to audit, not engaging other third-party providers
without consent, etc. Personal data breaches: depending on the breach, the competent
supervisory authority and/or the data subject may need to be informed of a personal data
breach within 72 hours after becoming aware of such breach.

    - Record keeping: Controllers and processors are required to be able to demonstrate
compliance with the rules imposed by the GDPR at all times and on an ongoing basis. To
that end, organizations must maintain a record containing a description of all their data
processing activities.

    - Data controllers and processors may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer
(“DPO”) in certain situations.

    - The transfer of personal data to entities outside the EEA is subject to specific requirements.

Fines for breach of the GDPR may be significant, depending on circumstances of an individual
breach. In the worst-case scenario, they can go as high as 20 million euros or 4% of our total annual
revenue. Moreover, the supervisory authority may restrict further use of data in question, which could
potentially impact our operations.

**_France_**

In France, the French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended (“FDPA”) has been
amended to take into account the requirements of the GDPR and supplement them with additional
provisions, for example concerning minor’s consent or the right for data subjects to decide on the use
of their personal data after their death. The FDPA also empowers the French Data Protection Authority
(Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (“CNIL”)) to ensure compliance with the French
data protection legal framework, and notably the requirements set out in the GDPR and the FDPA.

share capital and voting rights in the SSN Issuer or cease to own and control the right to appoint (x) at
least a majority of the directors of the board or equivalent officers of the SSN Issuer or (y) the legal
representatives of the SSN Issuer, and (ii) at any time following a Qualifying IPO (x) Olivier Bertrand
and his Related Parties collectively cease to own directly or indirectly more than 35% of the share
capital and voting rights of the SSN Issuer or (y) any person or group of persons acting in concert
acquires (directly or indirectly) more of the voting share capital of the SSN Issuer than is held by Olivier
Bertrand and his Related Parties collectively), the SSN Issuer shall promptly notify the Agent of that
event (and, in any event, within five days of such event having occurred), a Lender will not be obliged
to fund a Utilization (unless that Lender consents so to fund) and if a Lender so requires and informs
the Agent within 60 days of that Lender having been notified of the occurrence of the Change of Control,
the Agent will promptly notify the SSN Issuer and at the end of such 60 day period, the New Revolving
Credit Facility will be immediately cancelled insofar as it is made available by that Lender and that
Lender’s participation in all outstanding Utilizations will, together with accrued interest and all other
amounts accrued to that Lender under the Finance Documents shall become immediately due and
payable.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR plus a margin that may range
from 2.75% per annum to 2.25% per annum. The margin is adjusted by reference to a Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio save that, for purposes of determining the margin, no account will be taken of any
_pro forma adjustments in respect of cost savings and/or revenue synergies with respect to asset sales,_
investments or acquisitions. Furthermore, the applicable margin shall be subject to further adjustment
upwards or downwards depending on the Group’s satisfaction of certain sustainability KPIs.

The SSN Issuer is also required to pay a commitment fee, quarterly in arrears, on available but
unused commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement at a rate of 30% of the
applicable margin. The SSN Issuer is also required to pay an arrangement fee and certain fees to the
Arrangers, the Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Facility.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The Facility will be guaranteed by the Guarantors and (subject to certain agreed security
principles set out in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) will be secured by security over the
shares in the Guarantors held by members of the Restricted Group and over certain assets of the
Guarantors as further described in the section entitled “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Security”._

**_Covenants_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary positive and negative
covenants (including restrictive covenants that will largely replicate those which apply to the Senior
Secured Notes), subject to certain agreed exceptions. Certain of these covenants are summarized
below.

_Affirmative Covenants_

The affirmative covenants include obligations with respect to, among other things: (i) providing
certain financial information, including annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements and an annual
budget; (ii) compliance with laws and regulations; (iii) maintaining in full force and effect certain
authorizations and consents; (iv) safeguarding intellectual property; (v) maintaining certain insurances;
(vi) the payment of taxes; (vii) the maintenance of pari passu ranking; (viii) further assurance provisions;
(ix) Guarantor coverage (as to which see the section below entitled “—Guarantor Coverage”).

_Negative Covenants_

The negative covenants include restrictions with respect to, among other things: (i) the activities
of the SSN Issuer; (iii) changing the center of main interests of Obligors; (iv) entering into mergers,
acquisitions and joint ventures; (v) the incurrence of certain indebtedness; (vi) the issuance, repayment
and purchase of certain notes and other indebtedness (as to which see the sections below entitled

202


-----

“—Notes Purchase Condition” and”—Notes and Pari Passu Debt”); (vii) modifying the Franchise
Agreements and (viii) compliance with certain anti-corruption and sanction laws.

_Guarantor Coverage_

The SSN Issuer must ensure that the aggregate (without double counting) earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation (calculated on a LTM basis on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA,
taking each entity on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra-group items) of the Guarantors
exceeds 75% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Restricted Group (i) within 120 days of the Closing
Date and (ii) thereafter, within 120 days of the date on which the Annual Financial Statements are
required to be delivered to the Agent, in each case by reference to most recent Annual Financial
Statements delivered to the Agent.

For the purpose of calculating the Guarantors’ contribution to the Guarantor coverage test: (i)
any entity having negative EBITDA shall be deemed to have zero EBITDA in the numerator for the
purposes of determining its contribution to the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group; (ii) any member of
the Group that is not required to become a Guarantor as a result of the application of the Agreed
Security Principles will not be required to become a Guarantor and shall not be taken into account in
the denominator for the purposes of determining the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group; (iii) the
EBITDA of any joint venture shall not be taken into account in the denominator for the purposes of
determining the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group; and (iv) a member of the Group shall be deemed
to be a Guarantor provided that it has acceded to the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in such
capacity, notwithstanding the fact that it may only guarantee part of the facility and that, due to the
guarantee limitations, the amount so guaranteed is equal to zero

_Notes Purchase Condition_

The Restricted Group is prohibited from prepaying, purchasing, defeasing, redeeming, retiring
or acquiring (for the purpose of this paragraph only, collectively “purchasing”) any Relevant Debt (being
any Pari Passu Notes or Debt with a scheduled maturity date 12 months or more from the date on which
it was incurred (but excluding the facility) (or any Permitted Refinancing Debt in relation thereto)) if:
(i) an Event of Default is continuing or would result from such purchase; or (ii) the aggregate principal
face amount of all Relevant Debt that is, or has been, purchased exceeds the Restricted Debt Purchase
Basket (being 50 per cent. of the original aggregate principal face amount of the Senior Secured Notes
as at the Closing Date), unless commitments and/or utilizations under the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement are cancelled and/or prepaid (as applicable) in the same proportion by which the Relevant
Debt that is purchased exceeds the Restricted Debt Purchase Basket until the Total Commitments (as
so reduced) are equal to €25 million, provided that the notes purchase condition shall be deactivated
for so long as the Restricted Group’s Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is equal to or below 2.50:1.0
(pro forma any such payment or cancellation).

These restrictions do not apply where the Relevant Debt purchase is funded with the proceeds
of New Shareholder Injections or is undertaken following a Change of Control (provided the SSN Issuer
has complied with its notification and mandatory prepayment obligations).

_Notes and Pari Passu Debt_

The SSN Issuer must ensure that, among other things:

(a) the only issuer of the Subordinated Notes is the SSN Issuer (or a Holding Company of the SSN
Issuer) and that no other member of the Group may be a co-issuer of the Subordinated Notes;
and

(b) the Subordinated Note Liabilities do not benefit from any Security, save for Security which ranks
junior to the Security granted in respect of the Finance Documents and Pari Passu Debt
Documents).

203


-----

_Financial Covenant_

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Group to observe a financial
covenant which requires us to ensure that the Restricted Group’s Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio
does not exceed the level set forth under the "Covenant" column of the table below opposite the period
during which such Testing Date occurs. At any time that there are total cash advances under all
outstanding Loans (excluding any Utilizations of the Facility by way of Letters of Credit (or bank
guarantees) and any Utilization of an Ancillary Facility other than, in each case, by way of cash drawing)
in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than 40% of the Total Commitments on the last day of the
Relevant Period ending on a Quarter Date on or after December 31, 2021.

**Testing Date** **Covenant**

From December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022 10.0:1.0

From December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 9.5:1.0

From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 8.5:1.0

From December 31, 2024 and thereafter 8.0:1.0

The definition of Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio follows the definition of “Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio” in the section entitled “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions,”
save that, for the purpose of determining compliance with the financial covenant, only certain specified
cost saving and/or revenue synergies in respect of permitted acquisitions may be taken into account.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in
certain cases to agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications), the occurrence of which
would allow the Majority Lenders to accelerate all or part of the outstanding utilizations and/or terminate
their commitments and/or declare all or part of their utilizations payable on demand and/or declare that
cash cover in respect of ancillary facilities and outstanding letters of credit is immediately due and
payable or is payable on demand and/or instruct the Security Agent to exercise its rights and powers
under the Finance Documents.

**_Governing Law_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law although certain of
the restrictive covenants and certain events of default, which are included in the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and largely replicate those which apply to the Senior Secured Notes, are construed
in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors under the financing arrangements, the Issuer
(together, along with any other members of the Group (including the SSN guarantors within 120 days
from the Issue Date) that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time, the “Debtors”), on
or about the Issue Date will enter into an intercreditor agreement with, among others, BNP Paribas as
Revolving Agent, BNP Paribas as Security Agent, the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility
and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as trustee for the Senior Secured Notes. Unless stated otherwise,
capitalized terms set forth and used in the remainder of this section entitled “Intercreditor Agreement”
have the same meaning as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, which may have different meanings
from the meanings given to such terms used elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

|From December 31, 2024 and thereafter|8.0:1.0|

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth, among other things:

      - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of, and security interests over certain assets
and property granted by, the Debtors (such security, the “Transaction Security”);

      - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

      - the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated;

      - when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

      - when Transaction Security and guarantees may be released to permit a sale or disposal of
any assets subject to Transaction Security;

      - turnover provisions; and

      - the order for applying proceeds from enforcement action and other amounts received by
the Security Agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to certain other and future permitted
indebtedness, including:

      - obligations to counterparties to certain hedging agreements permitted under the terms of
the Credit Facility Documents, Pari Passu Debt Documents and Subordinated Note
Documents (each as defined below) and entered into by the Issuer for the purpose of
hedging interest rate risk (“Hedge Counterparties,” and such obligations, the “Hedging
**Liabilities” and each finance document relating thereto, a “Hedging Agreement”);**

      - indebtedness entitled to be treated _pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility_
(excluding Hedging Liabilities) in respect of the Transaction Security and under the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness, together with the New Revolving Credit
Facility, the “Credit Facility Liabilities,” and the holders of such indebtedness, the “Credit
**Facility Lenders,” and each finance document relating thereto, a “Credit Facility**
**Document” and each such financing a “Credit Facility”);**

      - indebtedness entitled to be treated pari passu with the Notes (excluding Hedging Liabilities)
in respect of the Transaction Security and under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(such indebtedness, together with the Notes, the “Pari Passu Debt Liabilities,” and the
holders of such indebtedness, the “Pari Passu Debt Creditors” and each finance
document relating thereto, a “Pari Passu Debt Document”); and

      - indebtedness arising from the issuance of subordinated notes by the Issuer or any holding
company of the Issuer and subordinated to the _Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined below),_
the Credit Facility Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities in respect of the Transaction
Security under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness, the
“Subordinated Notes”).

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to
read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the description that follows, defines your rights as
holders of the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, by accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall
be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

205


-----

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Ranking and Priority of Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities shall rank in right and priority of
payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior-ranking liabilities as
follows:

      - _first, the “Super Senior Liabilities,” consisting of the Credit Facility Liabilities and any_
Hedging Liabilities solely in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities and Pari Passu Debt
Liabilities (the “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities,” and the holders of such Super Senior
Liabilities, the “Super Senior Creditors”), the “Pari Passu Liabilities,” consisting of the Pari
Passu Debt Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities to the extent they are not Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities (the “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities,” and the holders of such Pari Passu
Liabilities, the “Pari Passu Creditors”) and the “Subordinated Note Trustee Amounts,”
consisting of certain fees, costs and expenses payable to the trustee for the any
Subordinated Notes (the “Subordinated Note Trustee”) for its own account and certain
Liabilities payable to the Security Agent _pari passu and without any preference between_
them; and

      - _second, the liabilities in respect of the Subordinated Notes (the “Subordinated Note_
Liabilities,” and the holders of such Subordinated Note Liabilities, the “Subordinated Note
Creditors” and each finance document relating thereto, a “Subordinated Note Document”)
(excluding any Subordinated Note Trustee Amounts).

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that certain intercompany obligations of the Issuer and
certain of its subsidiaries to other members of the Group (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”) and investor
debt consisting of liabilities owed by the Issuer to certain shareholders of the Issuer (“Investor
Liabilities”) are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Super Senior
Creditors, the Pari Passu Creditors and the Subordinated Note Creditors (such creditors together, the
“Primary Creditors”). The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank any of the Investor
Liabilities or the Intra-Group Liabilities as between themselves.

Subject to the section below entitled “—Application of Proceeds,” the Intercreditor Agreement
will not prevent payment by the Debtors of certain fees, costs and expenses (as set out in further detail
in the Intercreditor Agreement) owing to the representatives of the creditors in relation to the Credit
Facility Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the Subordinated Note Liabilities (each such
representative, a “Creditor Representative”).

_Ranking and Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security shall rank and secure the
following liabilities (but only to the extent such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those
liabilities) as follows:

      - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities and the Subordinated Note
Trustee Amounts and certain liabilities of the Security Agent pari passu and without any
preference between them; and

      - second, the Subordinated Note Liabilities (excluding any Subordinated Note Trustee
Amounts).

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds from an enforcement of Transaction Security
are required to be applied as provided under the section below entitled “—Application of Proceeds”).

**_Restrictions on Credit Facility Liabilities, Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and Subordinated Note_**
**_Liabilities_**

_Permitted Payments: Credit Facility Liabilities and Pari Passu Debt Liabilities_

Prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities or
the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Acceleration Event”), the Intercreditor Agreement
imposes no restrictions on payments to be made in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities pursuant to
the Credit Facility Documents or the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities pursuant to the Pari Passu Debt
Documents. Following a Senior Secured Acceleration Event, no member of the Group may make (and
no Super Senior Creditor or Pari Passu Creditor (such creditors together, the “Senior Secured
**Creditors”) may receive) payments of the Super Senior Liabilities or Pari Passu Liabilities (as**
applicable) except from, subject to certain exceptions, enforcement proceeds distributed in accordance
with the section below entitled “—Application of Proceeds”.

_Permitted Payments: Subordinated Note Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts any member of the Group from making payments in
respect of the Subordinated Note Liabilities, except in certain circumstances as summarized below.

Prior to the later of the date on which all the Super Senior Liabilities are discharged in full (the
“Super Senior Discharge Date”) and the date on which all the Pari Passu Liabilities are discharged in
full (the “Pari Passu Discharge Date”) (the latter to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the
Pari Passu Discharge Date, the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), certain payments may be made
in respect of the Subordinated Note Liabilities in accordance with the Subordinated Note Documents if:

(a) (i) the payment is of any of the principal amount (including capitalized interest) of the
Subordinated Note Liabilities or any other amount which is not an amount of principal or
capitalized interest, in each case, which is not prohibited from being made by any Credit Facility
Document, Pari Passu Debt Document or Hedging Agreement (together, the “Senior Secured
**Finance Documents”); (ii) no Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is**
outstanding; and (iii) no default arising by reason of non-payment under any Senior Secured
Finance Document has occurred and is continuing (a “Senior Secured Payment Default”); or

(b) the requisite majority of Credit Facility Lenders (the “Majority Credit Facility Lenders”) and
each Creditor Representative acting on behalf of any Pari Passu Lenders or Pari Passu
Noteholders (as each term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (the “Required Pari
**Passu Creditors”) give prior consent to that payment being made; or**

(c) the payment is of any Subordinated Note Trustee Amount; or

(d) the payment is of costs, commissions, taxes and expenses reasonably incurred (with
documented evidence thereof) in respect of the Subordinated Note Documents up to an
aggregate amount not exceeding €2,000,000.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date,
payments may be made to the Subordinated Note Creditors in respect of the Subordinated Note
Liabilities in accordance with the Subordinated Note Documents.

_Permitted Payments: Subordinated Note Liabilities—Issue of Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with
the prior consent of the Instructing Group (as defined below), the Debtors will not be entitled to make,
and no Subordinated Note Creditor will be entitled to receive from the Debtors or any of their
subsidiaries, any payment in respect of the Subordinated Note Liabilities (other than such payments
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement) if a Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice is
outstanding.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice is
“outstanding” during the period from the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default

207


-----

arising under any Senior Secured Finance Document (other than a Senior Secured Payment Default)
(a “Subordinated Note Payment Stop Event”), any Creditor Representative (other than the
Subordinated Note Trustee) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Credit Facility Lenders or the
Required Pari Passu Creditors) (a “Relevant Representative”) issues a notice (a “Subordinated Note
**Payment Stop Notice”) to the Subordinated Note Trustee and the Security Agent (with a copy to the**
Issuer) advising that that Subordinated Note Payment Stop Event has occurred and is continuing until
the first to occur of: (i) the date which is 179 days after the date of issue of the Subordinated Note
Payment Stop Notice; (ii) if a Subordinated Note Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after
the issue of a Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Subordinated Note
Standstill Period expires; (iii) the date on which the Subordinated Note Payment Stop Event in respect
of which that Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice was issued is no longer continuing provided that,
at such time no other event of default is continuing under any Senior Secured Finance Document;
(iv) the date on which the Relevant Representative cancels that Subordinated Note Payment Stop
Notice by notice to the Subordinated Note Trustee and the Security Agent (with a copy to the Issuer);
(v) the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and (vi) the date on which any Subordinated Note Creditor
takes any enforcement action that it is permitted to take under the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ability of a Relevant Representative to deliver a
Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice is subject to certain conditions, including that: (i) a new
Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed
since the delivery of the immediately prior Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no
Subordinated Note Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Subordinated Note Payment
Stop Event more than 60 days after the date each Relevant Representative received notice of that
Subordinated Note Payment Stop Event.

_Permitted Enforcement: Subordinated Note Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the Subordinated Note Creditors from taking any
enforcement action in respect of the Subordinated Note Liabilities prior to the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, except in certain circumstances as summarized below.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Subordinated Note Creditors may take
enforcement action in respect of the Subordinated Note Liabilities if, at the same time as, or prior to,
that action (and subject to certain other conditions): (i) the Subordinated Note Trustee has given notice
(a “Subordinated Note Enforcement Notice”) to each Relevant Representative and the Security
Agent specifying that an event of default under the Subordinated Note Documents has occurred and is
continuing; (ii) a period (a “Subordinated Note Standstill Period”) of not less than 179 days has
elapsed from the date on which that Subordinated Note Enforcement Notice becomes effective; and
(iii) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Subordinated Note Standstill Period.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Subordinated Note Creditors may also take
certain limited enforcement action: (i) in circumstances where the Senior Secured Creditors taken
enforcement action in relation to the Issuer (provided that the Subordinated Note Creditors may only
take the same enforcement action in relation to the Issuer as the enforcement action taken by the Senior
Secured Creditors against the Issuer (but not against any other Debtor or any other member of the
Group)); and (ii) in certain circumstances, following the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to
the Issuer (but only to the extent that such insolvency event did not arise as a result of any action taken
by, or at the request of, a Subordinated Note Creditor).

**_Restrictions on Investor Liabilities and Intra-Group Liabilities_**

_Restriction on Payment: Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the Final Discharge Date, neither the Issuer
nor any other Debtors shall, and the SSN Issuer shall procure that no other member of the Group will,
make any payment of the Investor Liabilities at any time unless such payment is a permitted payment
or the taking or receipt of such payment is a permitted enforcement under the Intercreditor Agreement.

208


-----

_Permitted Payments: Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Issuer may make payments in respect of the
Investor Liabilities then due if:

(a) the payment is not prohibited by the Credit Facility Agreement(s), the Pari Passu Facility
Agreement(s), the Pari Passu Note Indenture(s) and the Subordinated Note Indenture(s); or

(b) the Majority Credit Facility Lenders and the Required Pari Passu Creditors or, after the Senior
Discharge Date, the Majority Subordinated Note Creditors, each consent to such payment
being made.

_Restriction on Payment: Intra-Group Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the Final Discharge Date, the Debtors shall
not, and shall procure that no other member of the Group will, make any payments of the Intra-Group
Liabilities at any time unless such payment is a permitted payment or the taking or receipt of such
payment is a permitted enforcement under the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Permitted Payments: Intra-Group Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Debtors and other members of the Group may
make payment in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities when due, subject to the circumstances as
summarized below.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that payments in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities may
not be made if, at the time of payment, an Acceleration Event has occurred unless:

(a) the Majority Credit Facility Lenders and the Required Pari Passu Creditors, or (after the Senior
Secured Discharged Date) the Majority Subordinated Note Creditors, consent to such payment
being made; or

(b) the payment is made to facilitate the making of a Permitted Credit Facility Payment, Permitted
hedge payment, a Permitted Pari Passu Debt Payment or a Permitted Subordinated Payment.

**_Enforcement of Transaction Security_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless otherwise instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as defined below).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security: Majority Pari Passu Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to the certain exceptions including those
summarized in the sections below entitled “Enforcement of Transaction Security: Majority Super Senior
_Creditors” and “Enforcement of Transaction Security: Majority Subordinated Note Creditors,” the_
Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions provided by the requisite
majority of Pari Passu Creditors (the “Majority Pari Passu Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security: Majority Super Senior Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will act in accordance with the
enforcement instructions received from the requisite majority of Super Senior Creditors (the “Majority
**Super Senior Creditors”) until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred if:**

(a) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have neither made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent
of that determination in writing) nor appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such
a determination, in each case, within three months of the date of delivery of the initial
enforcement notice;

209


-----

(b) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the date of the initial
enforcement notice; or

(c) an Insolvency Event is continuing with respect to a member of the Group (to the extent the
Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide enforcement instructions); or

(d) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have neither made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent
of that determination in writing) nor appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such
a determination and the Majority Super Senior Creditors: (i) determine in good faith (and notify
the other Creditor Representatives, the Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that a
delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability to effect a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or on the
expected realization proceeds of any enforcement; and (ii) deliver enforcement instructions
which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles (as to which,
see the section below entitled “—Enforcement Principles”) before the Security Agent has
received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security: Majority Subordinated Note Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the
Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security (but only to the
extent such security is expressed to secure the Subordinated Note Liabilities) which the requisite
majority of Subordinated Note Creditors (the “Majority Subordinated Note Creditors”) are then
entitled to give in accordance with the section above entitled “—Permitted Enforcement: Subordinated
_Note Creditors” if:_

(a) (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (as the case may
be) have instructed the Security Agent to cease or not to proceed with enforcement; or (ii) in
the absence of such instructions; and

(b) in each case, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have
not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below).

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that, notwithstanding the above paragraph, if at any
time the Majority Subordinated Note Creditors are entitled to give the Security Agent instructions as to
enforcement of the Transaction Security pursuant to the above paragraph and give such instructions,
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (as the case may be) shall
remain entitled to give instructions to the Security Agent as to enforcement in lieu of any instructions
given by the Majority Subordinated Note Creditors and the Security Agent shall act on the first
instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (as
the case may be).

_Exercise of Voting Rights and Power of Attorney_

Each creditor in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Investor Liabilities and each
Subordinated Note Creditor is required to cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by or under the
supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency,
rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security
Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), and each such creditor,
together with the Debtors, irrevocably appoints the Security Agent to be its attorney to (with respect to
any Investor, following the occurrence of any Event of Default) do anything which that creditor, or Debtor
(as the case may be), has authorized the Security Agent to do under the Intercreditor Agreement or is
itself required to do under the Intercreditor Agreement but has failed to do (including casting any vote
as described above) (but not to waive or amend Debt Documents in relation to the Investor Liabilities
to reduce the amount of or discharge or extend the date for payment of, or reschedule Investor
Liabilities).

210


-----

_Payment of the “soulte”_

(a) If, following an Appropriation (as defined below), a “soulte” is owed by the Secured Parties to
any Debtor or Investor, as the case may be, such “soulte” shall not be immediately payable but
shall be payable only on the earlier of (i) the date following 12 months after the date of the
enforcement of the Transaction Security pursuant to which such obligation arose and (ii) the
Final Discharge Date.

(b) The payment of any “soulte” payable by the Secured Parties to any Debtor or Investor, as the
case may be, is a several obligation (conjointe et non solidaire) of each Secured Party. The
amount payable in this respect by each Secured Party shall be equal to a percentage of the
appropriate amount of “soulte” to be paid equal to the percentage reported by (i) the amount of
Secured Obligations owed to that Secured Party extinguished through the enforcement of the
Transaction Security pursuant to which such “soulte” obligation arose to (ii) the total amount of
Secured Obligations extinguished through such enforcement.

security for any obligation of the Debtors or Investors under any of the Debt Documents to
which they are party including any obligation under this Agreement to pay back any Recoveries
by each Debtor or Investor prior to the Final Discharge Date. The Pledge Agreement shall
include an irrevocable instruction from each of the relevant Debtors and Investors to make from
such pledged bank accounts any payment required to be fulfilled under this Agreement or any

**_Enforcement Principles_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction
Security or take other action as to enforcement in such manner as the relevant group of Primary
Creditors entitled to give instructions as summarized in the section above entitled “Enforcement of
_Transaction Security” (the “Instructing Group”) shall instruct (provided that such instructions are_
consistent with the enforcement principles) or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security
Agent considers in its discretion to be appropriate and consistent with the enforcement principles.

The enforcement principles are set out in a schedule to the Intercreditor Agreement and
provide, among other things, that:

(a) it shall be the primary and over-riding aim of any enforcement to maximize, to the extent
consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the value realized from
enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to postpone (or request
the postponement of) any Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or liabilities sale in order to
achieve a higher price;

(b) to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all proceeds of
enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance with the
section below entitled “—Application of Proceeds”;

(c) to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Pari Passu Creditors: (i) all proceeds of
enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance with the
section below entitled “—Application of Proceeds”; or (ii) sufficient proceeds from enforcement
will be received by the Security Agent to ensure that, when the proceeds are applied in
accordance with the section below entitled “—Application of Proceeds,” the Super Senior
Discharge Date would occur; and

211


-----

(d) on: (i) a proposed enforcement in relation to assets other than shares in a member of the Group
over which Transaction Security exists, where the book value of the assets exceeds
€5,000,000.00; or (ii) a proposed enforcement in relation to the shares in a member of the
Group over which Transaction Security exists, which, in each case, is not being effected
through a public auction, the Security Agent shall, if requested by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (and subject to certain exceptions), appoint a
financial adviser to provide a fairness opinion in relation that enforcement.

**_Release of the Guarantees and Transaction Security_**

_Non-distressed Disposal_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in circumstances in which a disposal to a person
outside the Group is permitted under the relevant financing documents and is not being effected: (i) at
the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become
enforceable; (ii) by enforcement of the Transaction Security; or (iii) after a Senior Secured Acceleration
Event or an Acceleration Event in respect of the Subordinated Note Liabilities has occurred ((ii) and (iii),
a “Distress Event” and a disposal in the circumstances of (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Distressed Disposal”), the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized to, among other
things, release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement)) over that asset and, where the relevant asset consists of shares in the
capital of a member of the Group, to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a
Debt Document (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) over that member of the Group’s property,
provided that, in each case, the release of Transaction Security or such claims will only be effective
upon the making of the disposal.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent is also authorized to release
Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) where such release is necessary
to implement a merger or a reorganization permitted under the Credit Facility Documents, the Pari
Passu Documents, the Subordinated Note Documents and the Hedging Agreements or where a
member of the Group is designated as Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of each of
the Credit Facility Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Subordinated Note Documents,
in each case, subject to the conditions mentioned therein.

_Distressed Disposal_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that where a Distressed Disposal is being effected, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized, among other
things: (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over the asset subject to the Distressed
Disposal; (ii) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor
or a holding company of a Debtor, to release that Debtor or holding company and any subsidiary of that
Debtor or holding company from all or any part of its liabilities under the Debt Documents (as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) and Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or holding company or
any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company or any claims in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities or
Investor Liabilities; (iii) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital
of a Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor, the disposal of all, or any part, of certain liabilities under
the Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and certain other liabilities, provided
that, if it is intended that the transferee will not be treated as a Primary Creditor or secured party, the
transferee will not be treated as a Primary Creditor or secured party, and, if it is intended that the
transferee should be a Primary Creditor or secured party, then all, and not party only, of the liabilities
owed to the Primary Creditors (other than to any Creditor Representative or arranger) and certain other
liabilities shall be disposed of; and (iv) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares
in the capital of a Debtor or holding company of a Debtor, the transfer to another Debtor of all or any
part of the disposed entity’s obligations under Intra-Group Liabilities or other liabilities owed to a Debtor.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the net proceeds from each Distressed Disposal and
each debt disposal shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the section
below entitled “—Application of Proceeds” below.

212


-----

_Certain Limitations_

The Intercreditor Agreement will also include limitations on the ability to release the
Subordinated Note Liabilities and Transaction Security pledged in favor of the Subordinated Note
Creditors as part of a Distressed Disposal, including: (i) that the proceeds of such sale or disposal must
be in cash (or substantially in cash) and applied in accordance with the section below entitled “—
_Application of Proceeds”; and (ii) the sale or disposal must be made pursuant to a competitive sales_
process or where a financial adviser has delivered an independent opinion in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking
into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement and the circumstances
giving rise to such sale.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time
when the Majority Subordinated Note Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, enforcement
instructions in accordance with the section above entitled “Enforcement of Transaction Security:
_Majority Subordinated Note Creditors,” the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor or_
any subsidiary or holding company of a Debtor from certain liabilities under the Debt Documents (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those liabilities
(together with any other amounts owing to the Senior Secured Creditors) will be paid (or repaid) in full
in cash, upon that release.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in
relation to any member of the Group, any party entitled to receive a payment or distribution out of the
assets of that member of the Group (in the case of the Senior Secured Creditors, only to the extent that
such amount constitutes enforcement proceeds) in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall, to the
extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member
of the Group to make that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the secured
parties have been paid in full and the Security Agent shall apply such distributions in accordance with
the section below entitled “—Application of Proceeds”.

and Hedge Counterparties in the proportions their respective exposures at the enforcement date bore
to the aggregate exposures of all the Credit Facility Lenders and Hedge Counterparties at the exposure
date, the Credit Facility Lenders and Hedge Counterparties will make such payments from such
payments among themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Credit Facility Lenders and
Hedge Counterparties in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) their losses are
borne in those proportions.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, following an appropriation (or
similar process) of the shares in the capital of a member of the Group by the Security Agent (or any
Receiver or Delegate) which is effected (to the extent permitted under the relevant Security Document
and applicable law) by enforcement of the Transaction Security (the “Appropriation”) of Transaction
Security over shares, certain Secured Parties have not paid their share of the corresponding resulting
“soulte” (if any), such Secured Parties will make such payments among themselves as the Security

provide that it may be amended only with the consent of each Creditor Representative, the Majority
Credit Facility Lenders, the Required Pari Passu Creditors, the Majority Subordinated Note Creditors

Agreement; or (ii) the provisions in respect of redistribution, the enforcement of Transaction Security,
the application of proceeds, amendments and waivers, the effect of an insolvency event and turnover,
which shall not be made without the consent of:

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

Burger King France S.A.S., a société par actions simplifiée organized under the laws of France
(the “SSN Issuer”), will issue €     million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured fixed rate
notes due 2026 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and €   million in aggregate principal amount of senior
secured floating rate notes due 2026 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate Notes,
the “Senior Secured Notes”), in each case, under an indenture dated on or about November 2, 2021,
2021(the “SSN Indenture”), among, inter alios, the SSN Issuer, BK (UK) Company Ltd., NewCo GB,
Midco GB, certain subsidiaries of the SSN Issuer that will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes (the
“Guarantors”) and, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as security agent (the
“Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The term “Senior Secured Notes” refers also to Book-Entry
Interests (as defined below) in the Senior Secured Notes. Except as set forth herein, the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes include those set forth in the SSN Indenture.

The definitions of certain terms used in this description are set forth under the subheading “—
_Certain Definitions”. Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—_
_Certain Definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in the SSN Indenture. In this “Description of_
_the Senior Secured Notes,” references to (i) the “SSN Issuer” refer only to Burger King France S.A.S._
and not to any of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) “we,” “our,” “us” refer to the SSN Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

The terms of the Senior Secured Notes include those set forth in the SSN Indenture. The SSN
Indenture will not be qualified under, and will not be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “TIA”). Consequently, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes generally will not be
entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified
indenture, including those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and
to inform the holders of the Senior Secured Notes of certain relationships between it and the SSN Issuer
or the Guarantors. The Security Documents referred to below under the caption “—Security” define the
terms of the security that will secure the Senior Secured Notes.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the SSN Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and certain
other agreements relating to the Senior Secured Notes. It does not, however, restate any of those
agreements in their entirety. You should read the SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents because they, and not this description, define your
rights as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes. Copies of the SSN Indenture, the form of the Global
Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents
may be obtained upon request from the SSN Issuer as set forth below under “Listing and General
_Information”._

The SSN Issuer has made an application for the Senior Secured Notes to be admitted to the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Euro MTF Market”). The SSN Issuer can provide no
assurance that such application will be accepted. Please see “—Payments on the Senior Secured
_Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes”._

The registered holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
Only registered holders will have rights under the SSN Indenture.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The SSN Issuer will issue €    million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes and
€   million in an aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes in this Offering. The Fixed Rate

220

which respective time 100% of the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes of the applicable series
shall be payable, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The SSN Indenture will be
unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €    million aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate
Notes and €     million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes will be issued in this
Offering. The SSN Issuer may, subject to applicable law and the SSN Indenture, issue an unlimited
principal amount of additional Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Fixed Rate Notes”) and an unlimited
principal amount of additional Floating Rate Notes (the “Additional Floating Rate Notes” and, together
with the Additional Fixed Rate Notes, the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”. The SSN Issuer will only
be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in
the SSN Indenture, including the covenants restricting the incurrence of Debt and the incurrence of
Liens (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens”)._

Any series of Additional Senior Secured Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the
Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set
forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued;

Offering and, if issued, any Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the SSN Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase; provided, however, that a series of Additional Senior Secured
Notes that is not, in the reasonable judgment of the SSN Issuer, fungible with the Senior Secured Notes
for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate CUSIP, ISIN or other identifying number

221


-----

from the Senior Secured Notes of such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes
of the SSN Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to (i) “Senior
Secured Notes” shall be deemed to include references to Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes
and shall be deemed to include the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as
any Additional Senior Secured Notes, (ii) “Additional Senior Secured Notes” shall be deemed to include
references to Additional Fixed Rate Notes and Additional Floating Rate Notes, (iii) “Fixed Rate Notes”
shall be deemed to include references to Fixed Rate Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as
any Additional Fixed Rate Notes and (iv) “Floating Rate Notes” shall be deemed to include references
to Floating Rate Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Floating Rate Notes.

**_Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum computed against
the principal amount outstanding on the Fixed Rate Notes. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will be
payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on        and      of each year, commencing on     ,
2021, to holders of record on the immediately preceding        and      , respectively.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has
been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Fixed Rate
Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each
interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**_Interest on the Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”),
reset quarterly, equal to        (subject to a 0% floor) plus      basis points, as determined by the
calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be Elavon Financial Services DAC.
Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will:

    - accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date
it was most recently paid;

    - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on each    ,   ,   and  , commencing on
; and

    - be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Note on    , and
immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the SSN Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Senior Secured Notes.

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period means the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m.
Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is
unavailable on a Determination Date, the SSN Issuer will request the principal London office of each of
four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the the SSN Issuer, to provide
such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market for

222


-----

deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so
provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than
two such quotations are so provided, the SSN Issuer will request each of three major banks in London,
as selected by the SSN Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as
of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative
Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the
rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so
provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately
preceding Interest Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any Interest Period the rate determined
based on the procedure specified in this paragraph is less than 0.0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0.0% for
purposes of determining the Applicable Rate for such Interest Period.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no
longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in
respect of euro-denominated securities hereunder, the alternative basis for determining the rate of
interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the euro-zone for
the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as
identified by the SSN Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted
successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the SSN Issuer, the SSN Issuer shall
determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Floating
Rate Notes; provided further that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall
in all cases never be less than 0%. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this
paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative
basis.

“Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that have
adopted the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with
the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on
and exclude       .

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information
vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time
Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. Brussels time on each
Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be
calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each outstanding Floating Rate
Note, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned
divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if
necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a
percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655%
(or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the
nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable

223


-----

Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, fraud or
manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Senior
Secured Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that
the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying the rate of interest on the Senior Secured
Notes is permitted by any applicable law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be responsible
for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made or intended
to be made by the Calculation Agent.

**The Proceeds Loans**

Upon the issuance of each of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes, the SSN
Issuer, as lender, and NewCo GB, as borrower, will enter into a proceeds loan agreement pursuant to
which the SSN Issuer will loan to NewCo GB approximately €196 million (the “Upstream Proceeds
_Loan”) from the gross proceeds from the issuance of each of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating_
Rate Notes as contemplated in the section entitled “Use of Proceeds” in this Offering Memorandum. As
a result of the Post-Closing Merger, the Upstream Proceeds Loan will be cancelled.

On or about the Issue Date, the SSN Issuer, as lender, and each of the following Subsidiaries
of the SSN Issuer, as borrower (each, a “Proceeds Loan Borrower”), will enter into proceeds loan
agreements pursuant to which the SSN Issuer will loan to each such Proceeds Loan Borrower the
following respective estimated amounts from the gross proceeds from the issuance of each of the Fixed
Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes (each a “Proceeds Loan” and collectively the “Proceeds
_Loans”, which does not include, for the avoidance of doubt, the Upstream Proceeds Loan):_

**Amount of Proceeds**

**Loan**
**from Senior Secured**

**Notes Proceeds**

**Proceeds Loan Borrower** **(€ in millions)**

Financière BKF SAS €260.0
France BKR SAS €205.0
Burger King Restauration SAS €133.0

Each Proceeds Loan will be denominated in euro. Each Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a
rate at least equal to the interest rate of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes. Interest on each
Proceeds Loan will be payable semi-annually in arrears (in the case of a Proceeds Loan relating to the
Fixed Rate Notes) and quarterly in arrears (in the case of a Proceeds Loan relating to the Floating Rate
Notes), in each case, with sufficient time in advance to permit the SSN Issuer to make payments of
interest on the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes. The maturity date of each Proceeds Loan will
be the same maturity date as the maturity date of the Senior Secured Notes. Each Proceeds Loan will
be an unsecured obligation of the relevant Proceeds Loan Borrower.

Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under each Proceeds Loan will be made
without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable Tax. In the event that the relevant
Proceeds Loan Borrower is required to make any such deduction or withholding, it shall gross-up each
payment to the SSN Issuer to ensure that the SSN Issuer receives and retains a net payment equal to
the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

The SSN Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loans will be pledged to the Security Agent for the
benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, as described under the caption “—
_Security”._

**Brief Description of the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes:

    - will be general obligations of the SSN Issuer;

    - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of the SSN Issuer that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

    - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Debt of the SSN Issuer that is
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

    - will be guaranteed within 120 days of the Issue Date by the Post-Closing Guarantors (as
defined below), which guarantees are subject to the guarantee limitations described herein;

    - will be secured by senior Liens over the Collateral as described below under “—Security”;
provided that the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations will
be repaid with the proceeds from any enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Senior
Secured Notes;

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of the SSN Issuer that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent
of the value of the property and assets securing such Debt; and

    - will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the SSN Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. The Senior Secured Notes
will be guaranteed within 120 days of the Issue Date by Burger King Restauration SAS, France BKR
SAS, BK Invest France SNC and Financière BKF SAS (together, the "Post-Closing Guarantors"), each
of which will be an obligor under the New Revolving Credit Facility within the same timeframe as
described. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:

    - will be a general obligation of that Guarantor;

    - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that
is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

    - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

    - will be secured by senior Liens over the Collateral, as described below under “—Security;”
provided that the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations will

225


-----

be repaid with the proceeds from any enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Note
Guarantee of that Guarantor;

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent
of the value of the property and assets securing such Debt;

    - will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of that Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors; and

    - will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law, including limitations
under corporate benefit laws, limiting, with respect to Guarantors incorporated in France,
the value of such guarantees to the amount of proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes onlent and not repaid to such guarantors with the proceeds of the Offering.

Assuming we had completed the Offering and applied the proceeds therefrom as described
under “Use of Proceeds,” of the Offering Memorandum, as of August 31, 2021, the SSN Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries would have had total debt of €1,135.4 million. In addition, we would have had
€80.0 million available for drawing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. The SSN Indenture will
permit the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur additional Debt in the future.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2020, the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors generated
94.1% of our EBITDA, and as at December 31, 2020 the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors held 88.1%
of our consolidated total assets.

As of the Issue Date, all of the SSN Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for
purposes of the SSN Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the SSN Issuer will
be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the SSN Issuer will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the SSN
Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

**Payments on the Senior Secured Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the**
**Senior Secured Notes**

The SSN Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Senior
Secured Notes for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying
Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.

The SSN Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and one or more
transfer agents (each, a “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.
The initial transfer agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent,
as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Senior Secured Definitive Registered
Notes (as defined herein) outstanding from time to time (the “Register”) and will make payments on and
facilitate transfer of Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes on the behalf of the SSN Issuer.

The SSN Issuer may change the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent without
prior notice to the holders of Senior Secured Notes. For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market
and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the SSN Issuer will publish
a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the

226


-----

manner permitted by such rules and regulations, post such notice on the official website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of
the Senior Secured Notes, but the SSN Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
transfer Tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer
or exchange (but not for a redemption).

**Form of Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued on the Issue Date only in fully registered form without
coupons and only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) will initially be represented by a Global Senior
Secured Note (as defined below) in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Senior
_Secured Global Note”). The 144A Senior Secured Global Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date,_
with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant
to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a Senior Secured Global Note
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Senior Secured _Global Note”_
and, together with the 144A Senior Secured Global Note, the “Global Senior Secured Notes”). The
Regulation S Senior Secured Global Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream. Please see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Global Senior Secured Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the SSN
Indenture. Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will
be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold
interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers
thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below
and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests
between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant
to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear
or Clearstream and their respective participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Senior Secured
Global Note (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Senior Secured Global Note (the “Regulation S
_Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor to the Registrar of a written certification (in_
the form provided in the SSN Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding
paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Senior Secured Global Note
from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Senior Secured Global Note
to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Senior Secured
Global Note to which it was transferred.

If definitive notes in registered form (“Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes”) are issued,
they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and

227


-----

any certificates and other documentation required by the SSN Indenture. It is expected that such
instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the SSN Indenture or as
otherwise determined by the SSN Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have
a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under
“Transfer Restrictions”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Senior
Secured Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, to
persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes. In
connection with any such transfer or exchange, the SSN Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents,
furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions, and pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other
than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SSN Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any
Senior Secured Definitive Registered Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Secured
Notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior
Secured Notes to be redeemed in part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment
date; or

(d) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer, Excess Proceeds Offer or Notes Offer.

The Senior Secured Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements, as described under “Transfer Restrictions”.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the SSN Issuer on the Senior Secured Notes or any of
the Guarantors with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction in which the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or
organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes
or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax or

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the SSN
Issuer or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the Senior

228


-----

Secured Notes) or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax,

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Tax Jurisdiction”)

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the
SSN Issuer on the Senior Secured Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Note Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the SSN Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of Senior
Secured Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from
such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received by the
holder in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however,
that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence
of any actual or deemed present or former connection between the holder or the
beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the
relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been a resident,
citizen or national of such jurisdiction or being or having been present or engaged in a
trade or business there or having or having had a permanent establishment therein for
Tax purposes), but excluding any connection arising solely from the holding of such
Senior Secured Note, the enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note or
under a Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Senior
Secured Note or a Note Guarantee;

(b) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a
Senior Secured Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days
after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to
the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the
Senior Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes, or
excise taxes imposed on the transfer of Senior Secured Notes;

(d) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial
owner of Senior Secured Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding
or deduction by presenting the relevant Senior Secured Notes to, or otherwise
accepting payment from, another Paying Agent;

(e) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments on the Senior
Secured Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(f) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of
the holder or beneficial owner of Senior Secured Notes, to comply with a reasonable
written request by the SSN Issuer (or any person acting on its behalf) addressed to the
holder or beneficial owner (and made at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably
to comply with that request), to provide information concerning the nationality,
residency or identity of such holder or beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes or
to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting

229


-----

requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice
of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of
deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without
limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax
Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally
entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(g) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the SSN Issuer or Guarantor
to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the
sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been
imposed on such payment had the beneficial owner been the holder of such Senior
Secured Note;

(h) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code,
as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that are
substantively comparable), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or
official interpretations thereof and any agreements (including any law implementing any
such agreement or any intergovernmental agreements between a non-U.S. jurisdiction
and the United States with respect to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official
interpretation thereof implementing such intergovernmental agreement) entered into
pursuant thereto; or

(i) any combination of items (a) through (h) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the
holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other
excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties and interest) which are levied
by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance, initial resale, enforcement or registration
of any of the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document
referred to therein (other than a transfer of Senior Secured Notes other than the initial resale by the
initial purchasers), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of
Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a
Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (d) or (f) through (h) above or any
combination thereof), or any such Taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a
result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Note
Guarantee.

If the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated
to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment on the Senior Secured Notes or any Note
Guarantee, each of the SSN Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the
Trustee (copied to the Paying Agent) on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment
(unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in
which case the SSN Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an
Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated
to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably
necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant
payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The SSN Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and
deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The SSN Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The SSN Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish
to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the SSN Issuer or a Guarantor, as the

230


-----

case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained,
other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably
requested by the Trustee or the Paying Agent, the SSN Issuer or the Guarantors will provide to the
Trustee or the Paying Agent such information as may be in the possession of the SSN Issuer or the
Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee or the Paying Agent) to enable the
Trustee or the Paying Agent to determine the amount of withholding Taxes attributable to any particular
holder; _provided, however, that in no event shall the SSN Issuer or the Guarantors be required to_
disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential.

Whenever in the SSN Indenture or in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” there is
mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes, of principal, redemption or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase
of the Senior Secured Notes, of interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any
of the Senior Secured Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention
of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were
or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the SSN
Indenture or any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Senior Secured Notes, and will apply,
_mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor_
is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction
from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Senior Secured Notes (or any Note
Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

**The Note Guarantees**

The Senior Secured Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. The Senior Secured Notes
will be guaranteed within 120 days of the Issue Date by the Post-Closing Guarantors. The Note
Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

As described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles,
each Restricted Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer that guarantees the New Revolving Credit Facility or other
indebtedness of the SSN Issuer shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the
Senior Secured Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of
obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes. The
Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees or security where, among
other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar
principles which limit the ability of the SSN Issuer, a Guarantor or any SSN Holdco Security Provider to
provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security interest granted be limited
by an amount or otherwise, as described below under “—Security—General”.

Each of the Note Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be contractually
limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its
guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise
to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the
liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note
Guarantee or any security interest granted by such Guarantor, as applicable, could be significantly less
than amounts payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes. Other debt of such Guarantor may not
be similarly limited. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the

231


-----

_Collateral—Applicable laws may limit amounts recoverable under the SSN Guarantees and the security_
_interests in the SSN Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the_
_Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral”._

The operations of the SSN Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the
SSN Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes. Not all of the SSN Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior
Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all
Debt and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the SSN
Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of
any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization
(and the consequent right of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to participate in those assets) will
be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the
extent that the SSN Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor
Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the SSN Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would
still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary.
See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuers
_and certain SSN Guarantors are holding companies dependent upon cash flows from the operating_
_companies of the Group to meet their obligations on the Notes or the SSN Guarantees”._

**_Release of the Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantees will be released:

(a) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of that Guarantor, including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
combination, to a Person that is not (either immediately before or immediately after
giving effect to such transaction) the SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale,
transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets” below;

(b) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that
Guarantor or any parent of that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either immediately
before or immediately after giving effect to such transaction) the SSN Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets”
below and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale,
transfer or other disposition;

(c) with respect to the Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that was required to provide such
Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” upon such Guarantor being unconditionally
released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Debt giving rise to the
requirement to provide such Note Guarantee so long as no other Debt guaranteed by
the relevant Guarantor would result in the requirement that such Guarantor provide a
Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Additional Guarantees” immediately after the release of such Note
Guarantee;

(d) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the SSN Issuer
under the SSN Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes;

(e) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers”;

232


-----

(f) (i) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” or (ii) in
connection with a Permitted Reorganization (other than the Post-Closing Merger);

(g) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the SSN
Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance of SSN Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(h) upon the sale of all the Capital Stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, that
Guarantor or any direct or indirect parent of that Guarantor pursuant to a security
enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(i) if the SSN Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the SSN
Indenture; and

(j) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Trustee will, at the
expense of the SSN Issuer, execute any documents reasonably requested in order to evidence or effect
such release, discharge and termination in respect of such guarantee, subject to customary protections
and indemnifications. Neither the SSN Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on
the Senior Secured Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. Each of the releases
set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the holders or any other action
or consent on the part of the Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely conclusively
upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described
above, giving rise to a release of the Notes Guarantee has occurred and that such release complies
with the SSN Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

The obligations of the SSN Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the Issue
Date Collateral (as defined below) on a senior basis. Within 120 days from the Issue Date, the
obligations of the Post-Closing Guarantors under their respective Note Guarantees will be secured by
the Post-Closing Date Collateral (as defined below) on a senior basis.

As of the Issue Date, the Issue Date Collateral is expected to include the following properties
and assets of the SSN Issuer and the SSN Holdco Security Providers:

    - the financial securities accounts (nantissements de compte-titres) to which the shares of
the SSN Issuer owned by each of the SSN Holdco Security Providers are credited, together
constituting more than 99% of the outstanding shares of the SSN Issuer;

    - the respective financial securities accounts (nantissements de compte-titres) to which the
shares owned by the SSN Issuer in each of its direct subsidiaries Burger King Restauration
SAS, Financière BKF SAS and Burger King Construction SAS are credited, in each case
constituting all of the outstanding shares of each such subsidiary;

233


-----

    - all intragroup loan receivables owed to the SSN Issuer (including the Upstream Proceeds
Loan and any other proceeds loans made available to NewCo GB);

    - the bank accounts of the SSN Issuer located in France; and

    - all receivables due to the SSN Issuer by BH pursuant to the BH Cash Management
Agreement,

together, the "Issue Date Collateral". In addition, BH has granted for the benefit of the SSN
Issuer only a bank account pledge over the dedicated accounts on which all funds advanced to BH by
the SSN Issuer pursuant to the BH Cash Management Agreement (and all proceeds thereof) will be
credited from time to time.

Within 120 days from the Issue Date, the Post-Closing Date Collateral is expected to include
the following properties and assets of the Post-Closing Guarantors:

    - the financial securities account (nantissements de compte-titres) to which the one share
owned by Financière BKF in BK Invest France SNC is credited;

    - the financial securities account (nantissements de compte-titres) to which the shares
owned by Financière BKF in France BKR SAS are credited;

    - the financial securities account to which the shares owned by France BKR SAS in BK Invest
France SNC are credited;

    - the bank accounts of each Post-Closing Guarantor located in France; and

    - all intragroup loan receivables owed to each Post-Closing Guarantor,

together, the "Post-Closing Date Collateral".

The assets and property of the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors and the SSN Holdco Security
Providers that are from time to time subject to, or required to be subject to, a Lien pursuant to the
Security Documents are referred to as the “Collateral”. The security and other agreements in respect of
the Collateral are referred to as the “Security Documents”.

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law, including
laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally, or other restrictions applicable to security providers, including laws relating to capital
maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers.

The Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees will also secure the
obligations of the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and certain hedging obligations on a _pari passu basis. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement, the obligations of the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations will be entitled to receive payment from the proceeds
of enforcement of the Security Documents prior to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, under the SSN Indenture, the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
will be permitted to Incur certain additional Debt in the future that may share in the Collateral, including
Debt with priority rights to proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. The amount of such

234


-----

additional Debt will be limited by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”. Under certain circumstances, the_
amount of such additional Debt that may share in the Collateral could be significant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security perfected in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:

    - if the cost of providing security or perfecting the same is not proportionate to the benefit
accruing to the holders of Senior Secured Notes and the other secured parties;

    - if providing such security requires consent of a third party and such consent cannot be
obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

    - if providing such security would be prohibited or to the extent it would be limited by general
statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles or if entering into the
Security Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors or officers, contravene
any legal prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors
or officers; and

    - until an enforcement action is taken, if perfecting such security would have an unreasonable
adverse effect on the ability of the SSN Issuer or the relevant Guarantor to conduct its
operations and business in the ordinary course as permitted by the SSN Indenture.

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the SSN Issuer, the
Guarantors and the SSN Holdco Security Providers to secure the payment when due of the SSN
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’, as applicable, payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the
Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, _inter alios, the_
Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the lenders under the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, certain secured hedge counterparties, and for the Trustee and the holders
of Senior Secured Notes.

Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests in France, the relevant Security Documents will provide for the creation of “parallel debt”
obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the
parallel debt (and not the Debt under the Senior Secured Notes, the Note Guarantees and the other
secured obligations). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in France. See
“Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral”.

Each holder of Senior Secured Notes, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed
(i) to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable, the
Security Documents, and the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Senior Secured Notes, by accepting a Senior
Secured Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such.

The holders of the Senior Secured Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and
therefore holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their
favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security
Agent (as creditor of the parallel debt, in respect of the Security Documents governed by French law),
as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the
Security Documents (the “Security Interests”) that is in accordance with the SSN Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders. The Trustee will have the ability

235


-----

to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents in
accordance with the SSN Indenture and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement of Transaction Security”._

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral,
the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors and the SSN Holdco Security Providers, as the case may be, will have
the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and
dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral, will be
entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock
dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or
reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to
the foregoing).

The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees may
not be sufficient to satisfy the SSN Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes and the Note Guarantees, respectively, and the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes
and the Note Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the
issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral,
subject to the terms of the SSN Indenture. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the
_SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be_
_sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”._

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the SSN Issuer or the
Guarantors in connection with this Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale
of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the SSN Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the
Senior Secured Notes or the Note Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid
and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the
Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all.

The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France. The term “Security Interests”
refers to the Liens on the Collateral.

Each of the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall procure that each of their respective
Subsidiaries, if any, and the SSN Holdco Security Providers shall, at their own expense, execute and
do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent or the Trustee, as
applicable, may require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral in any
required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security
Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with
the terms of the SSN Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for
facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document
and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or
in any receiver of all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors and the SSN
Holdco Security Providers shall, and shall procure that each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any,
shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the
Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent
may request.

**_Release of the Security_**

The Collateral will be released from the Liens over the Collateral under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

236


-----

(a) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of
such property or assets constituting Collateral to a Person that is not (either
immediately before or immediately after giving effect to such transaction) the SSN
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not
violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of
_Certain Assets” below,_ _provided that, in the event of the sale, assignment, transfer,_
conveyance or other disposition of any Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer (other than any
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such Capital Stock in
connection with an Initial Public Offering), the SSN Issuer will cause the Person to which
such Capital Stock is sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or otherwise disposed to
enter, upon the closing of such transaction, into a pledge of such Capital Stock securing
the obligations of the SSN Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes (or parallel debt
related thereto) to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of
Senior Secured Notes (which pledge shall be on substantially similar terms as the
pledges entered into by the SSN Holdco Security Providers with respect to such Capital
Stock on the Issue Date);

(b) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of the SSN Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock,
of such Guarantor;

(c) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien (the
“Notes Lien”) under the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens” so long as immediately after the release of the Notes_
Lien there is no other Debt secured by a Lien on the property and assets that were the
subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the requirement for the
Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees to be secured equally and ratably with, or
prior to, such Lien;

(d) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the SSN Issuer
under the SSN Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes;

(e) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(f) (i) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, other than
a transaction described in clause (ii) of this paragraph; (ii) with respect to the financial
securities accounts to which the shares of the SSN Issuer owned by NewCo GB are
credited, automatically and without any action by the Trustee, in connection with the
Post-Closing Merger, _provided that the financial securities accounts on which the_
shares of the SSN Issuer to be received by Midco GB as a result of the completion of
the Post-Closing Merger are credited shall be immediately subject to a first-ranking Lien
for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or (iii) in connection with a
Permitted Reorganization, other than a transaction described in clause (ii) of this
paragraph;

(g) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the SSN
Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant
_Defeasance of SSN Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(h) in the case of a security enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the release of the property and
assets subject to such enforcement sale;

237


-----

(i) in respect of a release followed by an immediate retaking in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(j) if the SSN Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the SSN Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(k) with respect to all of the shares of Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer (or any financial
securities account on which such shares are credited), automatically in connection with
an Initial Public Offering, not earlier than the date on which an underwriting, placement
or similar agreement is signed by the SSN Issuer with respect to such Initial Public
Offering, provided that if such Initial Public Offering is not completed as at the initially
anticipated date (unless postponed to a subsequent date falling no later than ten
(10) Business Days after such initially contemplated completion date), the SSN Issuer
will cause the owner of such shares to enter into a pledge of such Capital Stock
securing the obligations of the SSN Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes (or parallel
debt related thereto) to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders
of Senior Secured Notes (which pledge shall be on substantially similar terms as the
pledges entered into by the SSN Holdco Security Providers with respect to such Capital
Stock on the Issue Date); and

(l) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

Following written request by the SSN Issuer, and at the expense of the SSN Issuer, the Security
Agent and, if necessary, the Trustee will take all necessary action required to effect any release of
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of
the SSN Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Security Documents, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or
any action on the part of the Trustee. The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request
and rely conclusively upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred and
that such release complies with the SSN Indenture.

_Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax_
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date
and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be
payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or any Note Guarantee, the SSN Issuer under or with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Note Guarantee, as
the case may be, is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant
Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the SSN Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay
such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the SSN Issuer or Guarantor, as
applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available
(including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction where that would be
reasonable), and the requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or
rulings promulgated thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or
amendment becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax
Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date);
or

(b) any amendment to, or change in, any existing official written interpretation or application
of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including by virtue of a holding,
judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative practice) which amendment or change becomes effective on or after the

240


-----

Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date
after the Issue Date, such later date)

(each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”).

The SSN Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the SSN Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such
payment or withholding if a payment in respect of such series of the Senior Secured Notes was then
due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given.
Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the SSN Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent
tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that the SSN Issuer or Guarantor, as the case
may be, is required to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. In addition,
before the SSN Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Senior Secured Notes as described
above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation
to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and that it is entitled to redeem
such Senior Secured Notes pursuant to their terms.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate
and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions
precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes.

The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such Guarantor has become
obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any
successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the SSN Indenture, with respect to
a Change in Tax Law occurring on or after the date on which such successor Person becomes a party
to the SSN Indenture.

**Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs at any time, then the SSN Issuer must make
an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of Senior Secured Notes to repurchase all or any
part (equal to €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder’s Senior
Secured Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of holders
of record on relevant regular record dates that are prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to
receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer
will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the SSN Indenture.

Unless the SSN Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured
Notes in accordance with the SSN Indenture and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied
or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the SSN Issuer will deliver a notice to each
holder of the Senior Secured Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in
accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change of
Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Senior Secured Notes on the Change of Control
Purchase Date, and the notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase
the Senior Secured Notes on the date specified in the notice;

241


-----

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction
or transactions that constitute a Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which
will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements
under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations;

(d) that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless
the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid;

(e) that any Senior Secured Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue
interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a holder of Senior Secured Notes must follow to accept a
Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.

An agent of the SSN Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the
SSN Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Senior Secured Notes properly
tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for such Senior Secured Notes. The Trustee (or the
authenticating agent appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred
by book-entry) to each holder a new Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes equal in principal
amount to any unpurchased portion of Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Senior
Secured Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated Senior Secured Notes; provided that each
new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. The SSN Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or
as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

The ability of the SSN Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would
constitute a Change of Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control
under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the
SSN Indenture. The SSN Issuer’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries
may also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the
exercise by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Senior
Secured Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the SSN Issuer of such
repurchase.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the SSN Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will
have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Senior Secured
Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Senior Secured Notes seeking to accept the Change of
Control Offer. If the SSN Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the
Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would
give the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes the rights described under “—Events of
_Default”._

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the
SSN Issuer and its subsidiaries may prohibit the prepayment of the Senior Secured Notes prior to their
scheduled maturity. The New Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant restricting the SSN Issuer
from offering to purchase the Senior Secured Notes, unless the SSN Issuer has complied with its
mandatory prepayment obligations in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility as a result of such

242


-----

Change of Control. If the SSN Issuer was so prohibited from conducting a Change of Control Offer and
not able to prepay any indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the
SSN Issuer would be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations to holders of the Senior Secured Notes
who exercise their right to have their Senior Secured Notes repurchased following a Change of Control,
which would cause a Default or Event of Default under the SSN Indenture. A Default or Event of Default
under the SSN Indenture, unless waived by holders of the Senior Secured Notes, could result in a
cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements”._

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the SSN Issuer and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations
between the SSN Issuer and the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes. The SSN Issuer has
no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible
that the SSN Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to limitations discussed below, the SSN
Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the SSN Indenture, but that could
increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the SSN Issuer’s capital
structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the SSN Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Debt are contained
in the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Limitation
_on Liens”. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal_
amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “—
_Amendments and Waivers”). Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the_
provisions of the SSN Indenture will not require the SSN Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in
the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a
reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the
Senior Secured Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control.

The SSN Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the SSN Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the SSN
Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change
of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the SSN Indenture as
described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in
payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control provisions described above will be
applicable whether or not any other provisions of the SSN Indenture are applicable. Any such
transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the SSN Indenture,
including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The SSN Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in
connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of the SSN Indenture, the SSN Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the SSN
Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes of any series validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in a Change of
Control Offer and the SSN Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the
SSN Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the SSN Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon

243


-----

not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that such notice is given not more
than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above), to
redeem all Senior Secured Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a
redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not
included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including,
the date of the date of redemption.

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) the SSN Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any
“person” or “group” of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and
14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more
Permitted Holders, being or becoming the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3
and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly,
of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the SSN Issuer (or
any successor entity permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”); provided that, for the_
purposes of this clause, no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of
the SSN Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent;

(b) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than
by way of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or
a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the SSN Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person, other than or one or more
Permitted Holders; or

(c) the SSN Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or dissolution
other than in a transaction that complies with the provisions described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.”

The provisions under the SSN Indenture relating to the SSN Issuer’s obligation to make an offer
to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified
with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes if made
prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and
regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the SSN Issuer will publish notices relating
to a Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all the Senior Secured Notes of a series are to be redeemed at any time, the
Trustee or the Registrar will select the Senior Secured Notes of such series for redemption by a method
that complies with the requirements, as certified to the Trustee and the Registrar by the SSN Issuer, of
the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes of such series are listed
at such time or, if the Senior Secured Notes of such series are not listed on a securities exchange, pro

244


-----

_rata, by such method as the Trustee or the Registrar in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate_
unless otherwise required by law; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the
portion of the principal amount of a Senior Secured Note not redeemed to less than €100,000. Neither
the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this
paragraph.

No Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption
will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to
each holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption
notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the SSN Indenture.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates
to that Senior Secured Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Senior Secured Note
that is to be redeemed. While the Senior Secured Notes are held in certificated form, a new Senior
Secured Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Senior Secured Note
will be issued in the name of the holder of Senior Secured Notes upon cancellation of the original Senior
Secured Note. Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or
portions of Senior Secured Notes redeemed.

For Senior Secured Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of
Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or
Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So
long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes shall
also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be
the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations,
posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection
with any redemption, the SSN Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

**Suspension of Certain Covenants when Senior Secured Notes Rated Investment Grade**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes attain an Investment Grade
Rating from both of the Rating Agencies and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing under the SSN Indenture (a “Suspension Event”), beginning on the day of the Suspension
Event and continuing until such time (the “Suspension Period”), if any, at which the Senior Secured
Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Rating from each Rating Agency (the “Reversion Date”),
(whereupon the SSN Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing that the Senior Secured Notes
no longer have an Investment Grade Rating), the covenants summarized under the following captions
will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes and any related default provisions of the SSN Indenture will
cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt;”

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;”

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets;”

245


-----

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees;”

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;”_

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(8) “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” (but only clause (c)
_of the first paragraph of such covenant); and_

(9) “—Certain Covenants—Lines of Business”.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms on
and after the Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions
of the SSN Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the Suspension Period, and the
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been
in effect since the Issue Date, except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason
of a Restricted Payment made during the Suspension Period. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred
during the continuance of the Suspension Period will be classified as having been Incurred pursuant to
clause (2)(d) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”. Any
transactions prohibited by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Transactions with Affiliates” entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered_
into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (c) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with
_Affiliates”. Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action_
described in clauses (a) through (d) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”_
that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to
clause (2)(c) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other
_Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period,_
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the SSN Issuer will promptly deliver to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate notifying it of each occurrence hereunder. The Trustee shall have no duty to
monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the
ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Senior Secured Notes
achieve an Investment Grade Rating or upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event or Reversion Date,
as applicable.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The SSN Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, issue, incur, assume, guarantee or in any manner
become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become responsible for,
contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually or collectively, to “Incur” or, as
appropriate, an “Incurrence”) any Debt (including Acquired Debt); provided, however,
the SSN Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to Incur Debt (including
Acquired Debt) if:

(a) on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such
Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a _pro forma basis, the_

246


-----

Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the SSN Issuer for the four full
fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements of the SSN
Issuer are available immediately preceding the Incurrence of such Debt, taken
as one period, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and

(b) in the case of Senior Secured Debt, on the date of such Incurrence and after
giving effect to the Incurrence of such Senior Secured Debt and the application
of the proceeds thereof, on a _pro forma basis, the Consolidated Net Senior_
Secured Leverage Ratio of the SSN Issuer for the four full fiscal quarters for
which internal consolidated financial statements of the SSN Issuer are
available immediately preceding the Incurrence of such Debt, taken as one
period, would have been no greater than 6.0 to 1.0;

_provided, however, that the maximum aggregate principal amount of Debt that may be_
Incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors pursuant to this
paragraph (1) shall not exceed the greater of €40.0 million and 23.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA at any time outstanding.

(2) The first paragraph of this covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(a) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under
Credit Facilities (including in respect of letters of credit or banker’s acceptances
issued or created thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not to exceed the greater of (i) €110.0 million and (ii) 65.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA, plus, in the case of any refinancing of any Debt
permitted under this clause (a) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount
of fees, accrued and unpaid interest, underwriting discounts, premiums and
other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(b) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors of Debt represented by
the Senior Secured Notes, the related Note Guarantees, the Upstream
Proceeds Loan, the Proceeds Loans, in each case, issued or Incurred on the
Issue Date and, in each case, any “parallel debt” obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents;

(c) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany
Debt between the SSN Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that:

(i) if the SSN Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Debt and
the payee is not the SSN Issuer or a Guarantor, such Debt is unsecured
and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the
SSN Issuer, or the Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor (in each
case, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement) (A) except
in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in the ordinary
course of business in connection with the cash management
operations of the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and
(B) only to the extent legally permitted (the SSN Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in
the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor
to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in
connection with the subordination of such Debt); and

247


-----

(ii) (A) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to a Person
(other than a disposition, pledge or transfer to the SSN Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary) and (B) any transaction pursuant to which any
Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing by the SSN Issuer or
another Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary,
will, in each case, be deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt not
permitted by this clause (c);

(d) any Debt of the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt
described in clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue
Date after giving effect to the Transactions on the Issue Date;

(e) (i) guarantees of the SSN Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary
by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (x) the
Incurrence of the Debt being guaranteed was permitted by another provision
of this covenant and (y) if the Debt being guaranteed is subordinated to the
Senior Secured Notes or to a Guarantee then such guarantee must be
subordinated to the same extent as the Debt being guaranteed; or (ii) without
limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Debt arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Debt of
the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such
Debt and Lien is permitted under the terms of the SSN Indenture;

(f) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising
from customary agreements providing for guarantees, indemnities or
obligations in respect of earn-outs or other purchase price adjustments or, in
each case, similar obligations, in connection with the acquisition or disposition
of any business or assets or Person or any shares of Capital Stock of a
Subsidiary, other than guarantees or similar credit support given by the SSN
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring
all or any portion of such assets for the purpose of financing such acquisition;
provided that the maximum aggregate liability in respect of all such Debt
permitted pursuant to this clause (f) will at no time exceed the net proceeds,
including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value
of such non-cash proceeds being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to any subsequent changes in value) actually received from such
disposition;

(g) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Hedging
Obligations, in each case, entered into not for speculative purposes (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior
management of the SSN Issuer);

(h) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt
represented by (i) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings,
Purchase Money Obligations or other Debt, in each case, Incurred for the
purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction
or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Permitted Business
or (ii) Debt otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of
design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal)
or equipment that is used or useful in a Permitted Business, whether through
the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets, and any Debt which refinances, replaces or refunds such Debt, in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Debt Incurred pursuant to this clause (2)(h) and
then outstanding, will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of

248


-----

€37.5 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA; provided that the Debt exists
on the date of such purchase, lease, rental or improvement or is created within
180 days thereafter;

(i) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt in
respect of (i) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment,
customs, VAT or other Tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds,
instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided
by the SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business
or in respect of any governmental requirement, (ii) letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or
relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business
or in respect of any governmental requirement; provided, however, that upon
the drawing of such letters of credit or similar instruments, the obligations are
reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (iii) the financing of
insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business and (iv) any customary
cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements in the
ordinary course of business;

(j) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising
from (i) the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or
similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of
business; provided, however, that such Debt is extinguished within 30 days of
Incurrence; (ii) take-or-pay obligations, customer deposits and advance
payments received in the ordinary course of business from customers for
goods or services purchased in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) Debt
owed on a short-term basis of no longer than 30 days to banks and other
financial institutions Incurred in the ordinary course of business of the SSN
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries with such banks or financial institutions
that arises in connection with ordinary banking arrangements to manage cash
balances of the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(k) Debt (i) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such
Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer or is merged,
consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to
any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the SSN Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or any portion of the
funds used to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise
acquired by the SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or that was otherwise
Incurred in connection with or contemplation of such acquisition; _provided,_
_however, that, with respect to clauses (2)(k)(i) and (2)(k)(ii), at the time of such_
acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Debt is Incurred or
deemed to be Incurred, (x) the SSN Issuer could incur at least €1.00 of
additional Debt under clause (1)(a) of this covenant after giving _pro forma_
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and the Incurrence of such Debt
or (y) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the SSN Issuer
immediately after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt pursuant to this
clause (2)(k) would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to
such acquisition or other transaction;

(l) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Permitted
Refinancing Debt Incurred to renew, refund, replace, refinance, defease or
discharge Debt Incurred by it pursuant to, or described in, paragraph (1) or
clause (2)(b), (2)(d) (including, in the case of (2)(d), any Debt that renews,
refunds, replaces (whether upon or after termination or otherwise) or

249


-----

refinances any such Debt that has been repaid, prepaid, purchased,
repurchased, redeemed, defeased or otherwise extinguished, in whole or in
part), (2)(k) or (2)(m) or this (2)(l) of this covenant, as the case may be;

(m) Contribution Debt;

(n) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt
represented by guarantees of any Management Advances;

(o) Debt under daylight borrowing facilities Incurred in connection with any
refinancing of Debt (including by way of set-off or exchange) so long as any
such Debt is repaid within three days of the date on which such Debt is
Incurred;

(p) the Incurrence by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt (other
than and in addition to Debt permitted under clauses (a) through (o) above) in
an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding, including all
Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred to renew, refund, replace, refinance,
defease or discharge any Debt Incurred pursuant to this clause (p), in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of €50.0 million and 20.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA; provided that the aggregate principal amount of Debt
that may be Incurred under this clause (p) by Restricted Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of €25.0 million and 15.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA; or

(q) the Incurrence of Debt under any Qualified Securitization Financing; and

(r) Debt of the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of leases
(including Capitalized Lease Obligations) or other obligations existing on the
Issue Date or Incurred thereafter that would have been treated as operating
leases under IAS 17 (Leases), as in effect on September 30, 2019, before the
implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases).

(3) Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Debt, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital
Stock in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock
or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Debt due to a
change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Debt for purposes of this
covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated
restriction on the Incurrence of Debt, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal
amount of Debt denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Debt was Incurred, in the
case of term Debt, or, at the option of the SSN Issuer, first committed, in the case of
Debt Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Debt is Incurred
to refinance other Debt denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such refinancing Debt does not
exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Debt being refinanced; (b) the euro
equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Debt outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Debt is subject to a Currency
Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Debt is denominated covering

250


-----

principal and interest on such Debt, the amount of such Debt, if denominated in euro,
will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency
Agreement and, otherwise, the euro equivalent of such amount plus the euro equivalent
of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such
Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, for
purposes of determining compliance with this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant,
increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies or
currency values will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the SSN
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(4) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “—Limitation on
_Debt” covenant (a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or_
similar instruments, guarantees or Liens or “parallel debt,” in each case supporting Debt
otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included
and (b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in
the “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” covenant will not be treated as Debt.

(5) The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Debt issued with original issue discount, the accreted value
of such Debt and in the case of pay in kind Debt, the amount of such Debt shall
include any interest paid in the form of additional Debt;

(b) the principal amount of the Debt or the liquidation preference thereof, as
applicable, in the case of any other Debt determined in accordance with IFRS;

(c) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the
specified Person, the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Debt of the other Person;

(d) in respect of any Redeemable Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, equal to the greater
of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in
either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof; and

(e) for the avoidance of doubt and in accordance with IFRS, the principal amount
of Debt shall be determined net of any unamortized portion of capitalized debt
issuance costs.

(6) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Debt of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such
date (and, if such Debt is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this “—
_Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Restricted Subsidiary shall be in Default of this_
covenant).

(7) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Debt described in clauses (2)(a) through (r) of this covenant or is entitled to be Incurred
pursuant to clause (1) of this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the SSN Issuer, in its

251


-----

sole discretion, will be permitted to classify items of Debt on the date of its Incurrence
and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Debt in one of such
clauses or paragraphs, and the SSN Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item
of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (1) and (2) of this
covenant, and may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof)
to any other type of Debt described in this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant at any time;
provided that all Debt Incurred under any Credit Facility that is secured by Liens on the
Collateral that are accorded super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of
enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to have been Incurred in reliance on the
exception provided in clause (2)(a) above and may not be reclassified.

(8) Debt permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Debt but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more provisions of this covenant permitting such Debt.

**_Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions_**

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, when calculating the availability under any
basket or ratio under the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant or for the purposes of the definitions of
Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, in each case, in connection with a Limited Condition
Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default
shall, at the option of the SSN Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition
Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they
occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are
exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of
the SSN Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed
to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
Limited Condition Acquisition and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets
or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related
transactions; provided, further, that if the SSN Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the
time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the
definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets
or ratios under the SSN Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of
such Limited Condition Acquisition.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

(1) The SSN Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions (each of which is a “Restricted Payment”
and which are collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”):

(a) declare or pay any dividend on or make any other payment or distribution
(whether made in cash, securities or other property) with respect to any of the
SSN Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including, without
limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation
involving the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) to the direct or indirect

Subordinated Funding, or (iii) to all holders of Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary on a pro rata basis or on a basis that results in the receipt by the
SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of dividends or distributions of greater
value than the SSN Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary would have received
on such pro rata basis);

(b) purchase, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value
(including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation),
directly or indirectly, any Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer or of any Parent

(other than in exchange for Qualified Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer);

(c) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value any Debt of the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor that is
Subordinated Debt (excluding any intercompany Debt between or among the
SSN Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary), except (i) a payment of interest or
principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other
acquisition of Debt purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking
fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case, due

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make
a Restricted Payment if, at the time of and after giving pro forma effect to such proposed
Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur
as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;

(b) the SSN Issuer could Incur at least €1.00 of additional Debt under clause (1)(a)

Issuer on an accumulative basis during the period beginning on July 1,

Qualified Capital Stock or Deeply Subordinated Funding (except, in
each case, for Excluded Contributions or Cash Contributions for
Contribution Debt) (excluding the net cash proceeds from the issuance
of the SSN Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock or Deeply Subordinated
Funding financed, directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the
SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary until and to the extent such
borrowing is repaid); plus

(iii) (x) the amount by which the SSN Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any
Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the SSN Issuer’s consolidated
balance sheet after the Issue Date upon the conversion or exchange
(other than by the SSN Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiary) of such Debt
into the Qualified Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer or Deeply
Subordinated Funding and (y) the aggregate net cash proceeds and
the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable securities
received after the Issue Date by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted

Restricted Subsidiary that has been converted into or exchanged for
the Qualified Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer or Deeply Subordinated
Funding to the extent such Redeemable Capital Stock of the SSN
Issuer was originally sold for cash or Cash Equivalents, together with,
in the case of both clauses (x) and (y), the aggregate net cash
proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property of assets or marketable
securities received by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary at
the time of such conversion or exchange (excluding Cash Contributions
for Contribution Debt, Excluded Contributions and the net cash
proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities from the
issuance of the Qualified Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer or Deeply
Subordinated Funding financed, directly or indirectly, using funds
borrowed from the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary until and
to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

cancelled, liquidated or repaid, constituting a Restricted Payment made
after the Issue Date, an amount equal to 100% of the aggregate
amount received in cash and the Fair Market Value of property or
assets or marketable securities received by the SSN Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary and (y) in the case of the designation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or if an Unrestricted
Subsidiary is merged or consolidated into the SSN Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary are
transferred to the SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (as long as the
designation of such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary was
deemed a Restricted Payment), the Fair Market Value of the SSN
Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary as of the date of such designation
or at the time of such merger, consolidation or transfer of assets; plus

(v) to the extent that any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment that
was made after the Issue Date is made in an entity that subsequently
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of such

254


-----

Investment of the SSN Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of the
date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; plus

(vi) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the SSN Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not
otherwise included in the Consolidated Adjusted Net Income of the
SSN Issuer for such period.

(3) Clauses (1) and (2) above will not prohibit (so long as with respect to clauses (h) and
(q) below no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) any of the

that the SSN Issuer shall have complied with the “—Purchase of Senior
_Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” or “—Limitation on Sale of Certain_

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_**

The SSN Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, enter into or suffer to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, the sale, purchase, exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service)
for the benefit of any Affiliate of the SSN Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions
being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of €6.0 million
unless:

258


-----

(a) such transaction or series of related transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole,
are not materially less favorable to the SSN Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be, than those that could have been obtained in a comparable arm’s
length transaction with Persons that are not Affiliates; and

(b) the SSN Issuer delivers to the Trustee:

(i) with respect to any such transaction or series of related transactions involving
aggregate payments or the transfer of assets or provision of services, in each
case, having a value greater than €10.0 million, a resolution of its Board of
Directors set out in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such transaction or
series of related transactions complies with this covenant and that such
transaction or series of related transactions has been approved by a majority
of the members of its Board of Directors; and

(ii) with respect to any such transaction or series of related transactions involving
aggregate payments or the transfer of assets or the provision of services, in
each case, having a value greater than €30.0 million, a written opinion (a
“Fairness Opinion”) of an Independent Financial Advisor stating that the
transaction or series of transactions is (i) fair to the SSN Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on terms not less
favorable than could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable
transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an
Affiliate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this description will not apply to:

(a) any issuance of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,

The SSN Issuer will procure that the SSN Holdco Security Providers will not, directly or

SSN Issuer now owned or hereafter acquired except Permitted Collateral Liens; _provided,_ _however,_

261


-----

that the foregoing provisions of this sentence will cease to apply upon the completion of an Initial Public
Offering.

**_Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets_**

(1) The SSN Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate
any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration the SSN Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for
such Asset Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value (such Fair Market Value
to be determined as of the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale)
of the assets sold or Capital Stock issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the SSN Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of (i) cash; (ii) Cash
Equivalents; (iii) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the SSN
Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are
converted by the SSN Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the
extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion; (iv) the
assumption by the purchaser of any liabilities, as recorded on the balance
sheet of the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Debt), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result
of which the SSN Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer
obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further
liabilities; (v) Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt)
that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the
extent that the SSN Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any guarantee of such Debt in connection with such Asset Sale; (vi) any
Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (2)(e), (f) or (g) of this
covenant; (vii) consideration consisting of Debt (or the cancellation of Debt) of
the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary received by the SSN Issuer or any
Guarantor from Persons who are not the SSN Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; (viii) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the SSN
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale; provided that the
aggregate Fair Market Value of such Designated Non-cash Consideration,
taken together with the Fair Market Value at the time of receipt of all other
Designated Non-cash Consideration received and designated as such
pursuant to this clause (viii) (with the Fair Market Value of each item of
Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value), is less than the greater
of €22.5 million and 1.4% of Total Assets; or (ix) a combination of the
consideration specified in clauses (i) to (viii).

(2) If the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net
Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, within 365 days after the consummation of such
Asset Sale, may be used or committed in a binding commitment to be used (provided
that such Net Cash Proceeds are actually used within the later of 365 days from the
consummation of the Asset Sale or 180 days from the date of such binding
commitment) at the option of the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) to redeem, repay or purchase Senior Secured Notes (i) pursuant to an offer to
all holders of the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to at least
100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including)
the date of purchase (a “Notes Offer”) and/or (ii) pursuant to the redemption

262


-----

provisions set forth above under “—Optional Redemption”, in the case of this
clause (ii), in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Fixed Rate
Notes and Floating Rate Notes then outstanding;

(b) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay any Debt under Credit
Facilities (provided that in connection with any revolving credit borrowings
under Credit Facilities (other than the New Revolving Credit Facility or any
Permitted Refinancing Debt in respect thereof), the related commitment will be
cancelled in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or
purchased) Incurred pursuant to clause 2(a) of the covenant described under
the caption “—Limitation on Debt” that is secured by a Lien on assets or
property which constitute Collateral;

(c) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay (i) except with respect
to Debt that is the subject of clause (b), any Debt (provided that in connection
with any revolving credit borrowings under Credit Facilities, the related
commitment will not be required to be reduced) that is secured by a Lien on
assets or property which do not constitute Collateral or (ii) any Debt of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor;

(d) unless included in clause (2)(b) above, to purchase, or prepay or redeem or
repay, any Pari Passu Debt to the extent secured by a Lien on the Collateral
at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as
applicable) of such Debt (plus accrued and unpaid interest) so long as the SSN
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes an offer on a pro rata basis to all
holders of the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date
of purchase;

(e) to acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another
Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital
Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(f) to make a capital expenditure;

(g) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a
Permitted Business; or

(h) any combination of the foregoing.

(3) Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds (including cash or Cash
Equivalents received from the conversion of any securities, Senior Secured Notes or
other obligations), the SSN Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash
Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the SSN Indenture.

(4) Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided
in clause (2) of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. The SSN Issuer may
also at any time, and the SSN Issuer will within ten Business Days after the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €15.0 million, make an offer (an “Excess
_Proceeds Offer”) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets_
the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Debt, to the
extent required by the terms thereof, on a _pro rata basis, in accordance with the_

263


-----

procedures set forth in the SSN Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari
Passu Debt. The offer price for the Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of
such Senior Secured Note (and solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt, no greater than
100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Debt), plus in
each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption.

(5) To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and any
such Pari Passu Debt tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the SSN Issuer (or applicable Restricted
Subsidiary) may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase the
Senior Secured Notes and other Pari Passu Debt for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the SSN Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or validly tendered and not
withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be
purchased, prepaid or redeemed, as applicable, on a _pro rata basis (based upon the_
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and the principal amount or accreted
value of such Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or tendered by each holder). Upon
completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will
be reset to zero. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes to be
purchased exceeds the amount of proceeds received for application to such principal
amount, the Trustee will select the Senior Secured Notes to be purchased on a pro rata
basis (or in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice”), based on the
amounts tendered. Any Net Cash Proceeds payable in respect of Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer will be allocated between the Fixed Rate Notes
and the Floating Rate Notes in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amounts
of Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn.

(6) If the SSN Issuer is obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the SSN Issuer will
purchase the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders
thereof, in whole or in part in integral multiples of €1,000, on a date that is not earlier
than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess
Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as may be required under
the Exchange Act; provided that no Senior Secured Note of less than €100,000 remains
outstanding thereafter.

(7) The SSN Issuer will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent
those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the SSN
Indenture, the SSN Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under
the Asset Sale provisions of the SSN Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The SSN Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly
or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other Debt of the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor unless
such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the SSN
Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee of the payment of the Senior Secured Notes by such
Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee will be _pari passu with or senior to such Restricted_
Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Debt.

264


-----

Each additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves,
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted
Subsidiary (a) existing on the Issue Date (after giving effect to the Transactions on the Issue Date),
(b) that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was not
Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or
(c) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not
less than €250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A
or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection
with the operation of cash management programs established for the benefit of the SSN Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SSN Issuer shall not be obligated to cause a Restricted
Subsidiary to guarantee the payment of the Senior Secured Notes to the extent that such Note
Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) a
violation of applicable law, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through
measures reasonably available to the SSN Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary; (b) any liability for the
officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; (c) significant cost, expense, liability
or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and
other than reasonably expenses Incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings
required as a result or, or any measures pursuant to clause (b) undertaken in connection with, such
Note Guarantee, which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the SSN Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary or (d) an inconsistency with Agreed Security Principles.

**_Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The SSN Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or
otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in
respect of its Capital Stock to the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or
with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the SSN Issuer (including any Proceeds Loan) or any
other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the SSN Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the SSN Issuer or any other Restricted
Subsidiary;

provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock
and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans
or advances made to the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt (other
than any Proceeds Loan) Incurred by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

265


-----

(2) The provisions of the covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), the
Note Guarantees, the SSN Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents;

(b) any agreements or instruments with respect to Debt of the SSN Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date
pursuant to the provisions of “—Limitation on Debt,” and any amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that such
encumbrances or restrictions taken as a whole, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the SSN Issuer,
are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, in each
case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) is customary in comparable
financings and, in the case of this subclause (ii), the SSN Issuer determines at
the time such Debt is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the SSN Issuers’ ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer or treasurer of the SSN Issuer);

(c) any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, restatements,
modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those
contained in those agreements on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the SSN
Issuer);

(d) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and
licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person (including its Subsidiaries)
acquired by the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time
of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or
assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the
Person, so acquired (including its Subsidiaries);

(f) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or
substantially all the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts
distributions of such Capital Stock or property and assets of that Restricted
Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(g) Liens permitted to be Incurred under the provisions of the covenant described
above under the caption “—Limitation on Liens” that limit the right to dispose
of the assets subject to such Liens;

266


-----

(h) applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any governmental
licenses, authorizations, concessions, franchises or permits;

(i) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed
by customers or suppliers or required by insurance, surety or bonding
companies or indemnities, in each case, under contracts, agreements or
policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(j) customary limitations on the distribution or disposition of assets or property in
leases, licenses, joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements,
sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar
agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted
Investment), which limitations are applicable only to the assets that are the
subject of such agreements;

(k) Purchase Money Obligations and mortgage financings for property acquired in
the ordinary course of business and Capitalized Lease Obligations that impose
restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in
clause (1)(d) of the preceding paragraph;

(l) any agreement that extends, renews, amends, modifies, restates,
supplements, refunds, refinances or replaces the agreements containing the
encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (2)(a) through (k), or in
this clause (2)(l); provided that the terms and conditions of any such
encumbrances or restrictions are not materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes than those under or pursuant
to the agreement so extended, renewed, amended, modified, restated,
supplemented, refunded, refinanced or replaced (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or
treasurer of the SSN Issuer);

(m) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations; and

(n) any Qualified Securitization Financing.

**_Lines of Business_**

The SSN Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any
business other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the SSN
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer to
be an Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary or a Person
becoming a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction, or
Investment therein) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing at the time of
or immediately after giving effect to such designation and such Subsidiary to be so designated or any
of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any property
of, the SSN Issuer or any other Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer that is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary
to be so designated or otherwise an Unrestricted Subsidiary. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned
by the SSN Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted

267


-----

Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce
the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted
Investments, as determined by the SSN Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
of the SSN Issuer in such Subsidiary would be permitted at that time under the covenant “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments”. The Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted_
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving
effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments”._

The Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Debt by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary,
and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Debt is permitted under the covenant described
under the caption “—Limitation on Debt,” calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the
SSN Issuer as a Restricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy
of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the SSN Issuer giving effect to such designation and an
Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions.

**_Provision of Information_**

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the SSN Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(a) within 120 days after the end of the SSN Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal

provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the
SSN Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company
financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements,
including a discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial condition,
EBITDA and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments

affiliate transactions, material debt instruments and material contracts; and (v) material

available without unreasonable expense, in which case the SSN Issuer will provide, in
the case of material acquisition, acquired company financials, (iii) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated results of operations, financial condition and EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the SSN Issuer and any material change
between the current year-to-date period and the corresponding period of the prior year;
and (iv) material recent developments and any material changes to the risk factors
disclosed in the most recent annual report; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition, restructuring or
business consolidation or combination of the SSN Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer changes at the SSN
Issuer or change in auditors of the SSN Issuer or any other material event that the SSN
Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

In the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the SSN Issuer or any other IPO
Entity are listed on a Recognized Stock Exchange and the SSN Issuer or such other IPO Entity, as
applicable, is subject to the disclosure standards and reporting requirements applicable to issuers of
equity securities admitted to trading on such Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the
SSN Issuer will deliver to the Trustee such annual reports, semi-annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the SSN Issuer or such other IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such
Recognized Stock Exchange; provided that, if such reports, information or documents are not in English,
the SSN Issuer shall also simultaneously provide English translations thereof. Upon complying with the
requirements set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, and provided that (i) such requirements
require the SSN Issuer or such other IPO Entity to prepare and file annual and semi-annual reports and
(ii) the SSN Issuer or such other IPO Entity additionally provides (x) the information required in the next
succeeding paragraph and (y) within 60 days following the end of the first and third quarters in each
fiscal year of the SSN Issuer or such other IPO Entity, quarterly consolidated revenues, EBITDA and
net debt of the SSN Issuer or such other IPO Entity, as applicable, the SSN Issuer will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) above.

All historical financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS on a consistent
basis for the periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial
statements for the SSN Issuer or any Subsidiaries of the SSN Issuer or any disclosure with respect to
the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this
Offering Memorandum and in no event (i) shall U.S. GAAP information or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP
be required nor (ii) shall such report include separate financial statements for any Guarantor and
non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the SSN Issuer.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the SSN Issuer
will also (i) file a press release with the appropriate internationally recognized wire services (including,
without limitation, through the newswire service of Bloomberg, or if Bloomberg does not then operate,
any similar agency) in connection with such report or (ii) post each such report on such website as may
be then maintained by the SSN Issuer.

-----

So long as any of the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during
which the SSN Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom
pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, the SSN Issuer will make available to any
prospective purchaser of Senior Secured Notes or beneficial owner of Senior Secured Notes in
connection with any sale thereof the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

At any time that any of the SSN Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any
such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this “—Provision of Information” covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the SSN Issuer.

In the event that (i) the SSN Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it
continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the Commission or (ii) the SSN Issuer elects
to provide reports which, if filed with the Commission, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the
SSN Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the
provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the SSN Issuer will make available such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the SSN Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
Commission pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement,
the SSN Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs of this covenant.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “—Provision
_of Information” covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not_
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the SSN Issuer’s
compliance with any of its covenants under the SSN Indenture.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

_The SSN Issuer_

The SSN Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of
related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the SSN Issuer
is the surviving Person) or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of the properties or assets of the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in
one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(a) at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to, any such transaction or series of
transactions, either (i) the SSN Issuer will be the surviving Person or (ii) the Person (if
other than the SSN Issuer) formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger or
to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all
or substantially all the properties and assets of the SSN Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has been made (the “Surviving Entity”):

(x) will be a Person duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union, Switzerland, Canada or any province of
Canada, the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; and

270


-----

(y) will expressly assume the SSN Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes, the SSN Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Upstream Proceeds Loan (if not yet cancelled),
the Proceeds Loans and the Security Documents pursuant to a supplemental
indenture, accession agreement, security documents and any other relevant
document, in each case, delivered to the Trustee and the Security Agent and
the SSN Issuer will cause the SSN Holdco Security Providers (or any of them)
to enter into one or more pledges of all of the Capital Stock of the Surviving
Entity securing the obligations of the SSN Issuer under the Senior Secured
Notes (or parallel debt related thereto) to the Security Agent for the benefit of
the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes (which pledges shall be
on substantially similar terms as the pledges entered into by the Holdco
Security Providers with respect to the Capital Stock of the SSN Issuer on the
Issue Date);

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a _pro_
_forma basis (and treating any obligation of the SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary_
Incurred in connection with or as a result of such transaction or series of related
transactions as having been Incurred by the SSN Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and
be continuing;

(c) the SSN Issuer or the Surviving Entity would, on the date of such transaction after giving
_pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had_
occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (i) be permitted to Incur
at least €1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio test set forth in clause (1)(a) of the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant or (ii) have a
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such transaction; and

(d) the SSN Issuer or the Surviving Entity will have delivered to the Trustee, in form
satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease
or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such
transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this covenant and that the
supplemental indenture and the Senior Secured Notes constitute the SSN Issuer’s or
Surviving Entity’s legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with
their terms provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clause (b)
and (c) above.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to the Post-Closing Merger and shall not apply (other
than the requirements of clause (b) of the first paragraph of this “Consolidation, Merger and Sale of
_Assets” covenant) to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Sale if the SSN Issuer has complied_
with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets” or (ii) the creation of a new
subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer.

The Surviving Entity will succeed to, be substituted for and may exercise every right and power
of the SSN Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the SSN Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.

_Guarantors_

A Guarantor (other than any Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance
with the terms of the Note Guarantee and the SSN Indenture as described under “—The Note
_Guarantees”) will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person_

271


-----

(whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions,
to another Person, unless:

(a) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;
and

(b) either:

(i) the Person acquiring the property or assets in any such sale or disposition or
the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other
than the SSN Issuer or a Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such
Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, the SSN Indenture, the relevant
Proceeds Loans (as applicable), the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which such Guarantor
is party pursuant to a supplemental indenture, accession agreement and
appropriate security documents delivered to the Trustee and the Security
Agent; or

(ii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the
SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the SSN
Indenture.

Notwithstanding clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant under “—The SSN
_Issuer” and clause (a) of the first paragraph of this covenant under “—Guarantor” (which do not apply_
to the transactions referred to in this sentence), (i) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with,
merge into or transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the SSN Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) the SSN Issuer may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Guarantor. In addition, clause (c) of the first
paragraph of this covenant under “—The SSN Issuer” will not apply to any sale or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the SSN Issuer with or into an Affiliate
solely for the purpose of reincorporating the SSN Issuer in another jurisdiction for tax reasons.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this “Consolidation, Merger and Sale
_of Assets” covenant will not apply to any transaction or arrangement that is a Permitted Reorganization._

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The SSN Issuer and the Guarantors will not, and the SSN Issuer will not cause or permit any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any SSN Holdco Security Provider to, take, or knowingly or negligently
omit to take, any action which would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by
the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens, the implementation of any Permitted Reorganization and the
release of the Liens created by the Issuer Share Pledges in connection with an Initial Public Offering
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, and the SSN

272


-----

Issuer and the Guarantors will not, and the SSN Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or any SSN Holdco Security Provider to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent,
for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision
shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with any other provision of the
SSN Indenture (including without limitation, in connection with a Permitted Reorganization or an Initial
Public Offering), the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) the SSN Issuer, the SSN Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries and the SSN Holdco
Security Providers may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, implement any Permitted Reorganization or
release Liens created by the Issuer Share Pledge in connection with an Initial Public Offering; and
provided further, however, that, except with respect to clause (a) and clause (b) of the foregoing proviso
(provided that, in the case of such clause (b), unless no release of the relevant Lien securing the Senior
Secured Notes is required in order for the SSN Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any SSN Holdco
Security Provider to Incur a Permitted Collateral Lien, implement any Permitted Reorganization or
release Liens created by the Issuer Share Pledge in connection with an Initial Public Offering, such Lien
securing the Senior Secured Notes is retaken immediately following its release in connection with such
Incurrence), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or replaced or a Lien over the Collateral released and immediately retaken unless
contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement,
modification, replacement or release and retaking, the SSN Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the
Security Agent any of (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or
accounting firm, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent confirming
the solvency of the SSN Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or
release and retaking, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors or the chief financial officer of the
relevant Person which confirms the solvency of such Person after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release and
retaking and replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes created
under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified,
replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity (if legally applicable) or at law, that such Lien or Liens
were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the written direction of the SSN Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) comply with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement; (v) evidence the succession of another Person to the SSN Issuer, a
Guarantor or a SSN Holdco Security Provider and the assumption by such successor of the obligations
under the SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the applicable Note Guarantee and the Security
Documents, in each case, in accordance with “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets;” or as result of a Permitted Reorganization; (vi) provide for the release of property and assets_
constituting Collateral from the Lien of the Security Documents or the release of the Note Guarantee of
a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the SSN Indenture;
(vii) conform the Security Documents to this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes;” (viii) evidence
and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent; (ix) provide
for Additional Senior Secured Notes to also benefit from the Collateral or (x) make any other change
thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in any
material respect.

In the event that the SSN Issuer complies with this covenant, the Security Agent and the SSN
Issuer and the Trustee (subject to customary protections and indemnifications), if required, shall take
all action necessary to effect such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification, replacement or release and retaking.

273

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

At the written request of the SSN Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence or refinancing
of any Debt that is permitted to share the Collateral, the SSN Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the SSN
Holdco Security Providers, the Trustee and the Security Agent will (without the consent of the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes) enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each an “Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement”) on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement (or more_
favorable to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) or an amendment to or an amendment and
restatement of the Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment in the good faith judgment of the SSN
Issuer does not adversely affect the rights of holder of the Senior Secured Notes in any material
respect), it being understood that an increase in the amount of Debt being subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to be on substantially
similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes and will be permitted by this covenant if, in each case, the
Incurrence of such Debt (and any Lien in its favor is permitted by the “Limitation on Debt” and “Limitation
_on Liens” covenants); provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement_
will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the
rights, duties, liabilities, protections, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee and the Security Agent
under the SSN Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The SSN Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the SSN Issuer and without
the consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from
time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, error, defect or inconsistency of such
agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Debt covered by such agreement that may be Incurred
by the SSN Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to such agreement (including with respect to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to
new Debt ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes or the Note Guarantees, or an
amendment or modification of provisions relating to Debt ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior
Secured Notes or the Note Guarantees if such amendments do not adversely affect the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes in any material respect), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries or new Guarantors to
the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior
Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of or call options on the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement
any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) to enable a Permitted Reorganization or release Liens created by
the Issuer Share Pledge in connection with an Initial Public Offering, (8) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (9) make
any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes in any material respect.

The SSN Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on
behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase,
defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of Subordinated Debt; provided that such transaction
would comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Restricted Payments”. The SSN
Indenture will provide that each holder of a Senior Secured Note, by accepting such Senior Secured
Note, will be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, Additional Intercreditor Agreement and any amendment that complies with the provisions
of this covenant, and none of the SSN Issuer, the Trustee or the Security Agent will be required to seek
the consent of any holders of the Senior Secured Notes to perform its obligations under and in
accordance with this covenant. Each holder of the Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to have
consented to and directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to execute the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or amendment and restatement of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that complies with the provisions of
this covenant.

**_Limitation on Amendments to the Proceeds Loans_**

The SSN Issuer shall not sell, assign or otherwise transfer or forgive or waive any principal
amount of any Proceeds Loan (other than to secure the Senior Secured Notes, any Guarantee of the
Senior Secured Notes or the SSN Indenture or to grant Permitted Collateral Liens).

In addition, the SSN Issuer may not amend, modify or supplement any Proceeds Loan in a
manner adverse in any material respect to the holders of Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Proceeds Loan may be cancelled, forgiven or otherwise
repaid, released or discharged upon:

(1) a repayment or prepayment of all or part of the principal amount of such Proceeds Loan,
provided that, substantially concurrently with such repayment or prepayment, an
amount equal to the principal amount of such Proceeds Loan which has been repaid or
prepaid, is applied to the repayment, redemption, repurchase or discharge of the Senior
Secured Notes;

(2) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital
Stock of the relevant Proceeds Loan Borrower (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the SSN Indenture
and such Proceeds Loan Borrower ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the SSN
Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(3) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Proceeds Loan
Borrower (other than to the SSN Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale
or other disposition does not violate the SSN Indenture;

(7) (i) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” or (ii) in
connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall, as applicable, take all necessary actions reasonably
requested by, and at the expense of, the SSN Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any
redemption or release of the relevant Proceeds Loan in accordance with the foregoing provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent (except to the extent required under
clause (5) above) of or liability to the holders of Senior Secured Notes or any other action or consent
on the part of the Trustee or the Security Agent. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to
request and rely conclusively upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the relevant Proceeds Loan has occurred
and that such release complies with the SSN Indenture.

advanced by the SSN Issuer to BH under the terms of the BH Cash Management Agreement (and not
theretofore reimbursed), (B) all securities and cash equivalents purchased with any such cash, property
and assets (and not theretofore paid out to the SSN Issuer) and (C) all proceeds of the foregoing not
theretofore paid out to the SSN Issuer and shall cancel and terminate the BH Cash Management
Agreement and ensure that no further funds are advanced to BH thereunder or under any other cash
management arrangements whether now or hereafter in effect.

In addition, the SSN Issuer will not amend, modify, supplement, restate or replace, or cause or
suffer to be amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced, the BH Cash Management
Agreement or the BH Account Pledge in any manner that would be materially adverse to the holders of
Senior Secured Notes.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The SSN Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing
of the Senior Secured Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such Senior Secured
Notes are outstanding; provided that if the SSN Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the
Senior Secured Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or if at any time the SSN Issuer determines
that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain
a listing of such Senior Secured Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The SSN Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Senior Secured
Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions
of the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and
is paid to all holders of the Senior Secured Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time
frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any
offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of
any of the terms or provisions of the SSN Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes, to exclude holders of
Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where (a) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or
amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (b) the payment of the
consideration therefor would require the SSN Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a
registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including,
but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its
member states), and the SSN Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) such filing
would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file
the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any
summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such
solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt owed to the SSN

such Debt at the Stated Maturity thereof after giving effect to any applicable
grace periods, and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or
the maturity of such Debt has not been extended (a “Payment Default”), and in
either case the aggregate principal amount of such Debt unpaid or accelerated

satisfaction in full of all obligations under the SSN Indenture and discharge of
the SSN Indenture or in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the SSN Indenture and the
Security Documents or (ii) any security interest purported to be created under
any Security Document is declared invalid or unenforceable or the SSN Issuer,
any Restricted Subsidiary or SSN Holdco Security Provider granting Collateral
that is the subject of any such Security Interest asserts, in any pleading in any
court of competent jurisdiction, that any such Security Interest is invalid or
unenforceable, and, in the case of (i), such failure to be in full force and effect
or such assertion has continued uncured for a period of 15 days; and

(h) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the
SSN Indenture with respect to the SSN Issuer, a Guarantor, any SSN Holdco
Security Provider, BH or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that a default under clause (c), (d) or (f) of this paragraph will not_
constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes notify the SSN Issuer of the
Default and, with respect to such clause (c), (d) or (f), the SSN Issuer does not cure
such Default within the time specified in such clause (c), (d) or (f), as applicable, after
receipt of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (h), the occurrence of any
such bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to BH shall be deemed not be an
Event of Default if (and only for so long as) BH holds no cash or other property and
assets on behalf of the SSN Issuer pursuant to the terms of the BH Cash Management
Agreement.

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (1)(h) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding by written notice to the SSN
Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may, and the Trustee,
upon the written request of such holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any,
and any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts
payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes will become immediately due and
payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(h) above occurs and is continuing, then
the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid
interest on all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes shall become and be immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
holder of Senior Secured Notes.

(4) The SSN Indenture will provide that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Trustee
may on behalf of the holders of all of the Senior Secured Notes waive any existing
Default and its consequences under the SSN Indenture (except a continuing Default in
the payment of interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or the principal of any
Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting holder, which may only be waived with
the consent of holders of the Senior Secured Notes holding not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding under the SSN
Indenture) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and
its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (d)
above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting
payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes)
shall be annulled, waived or rescinded, automatically and without any action by the

278


-----

Trustee or the holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (i) the
indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; (ii) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or
action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (iii) the default that
is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

(5) At any time after a declaration of acceleration under the SSN Indenture, but before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee,
the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes, by written notice to the SSN Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind such
declaration and its consequences if:

(a) the SSN Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee (or another party
designated by the Trustee for this purpose) a sum sufficient to pay:

(i) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding;

(ii) all unpaid principal of and premium, if any, on any outstanding Senior
Secured Notes that have become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the
Senior Secured Notes;

(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon
overdue interest and overdue principal at the rate borne by the Senior
Secured Notes; and

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the SSN Indenture and
the properly Incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsels;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of,
premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and interest on the Senior
Secured Notes that has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration,
have been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

(6) Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Senior Secured Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any
trust or power.

(7) In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the SSN Indenture at the
request or direction of any holders of the Senior Secured Notes unless such holders
have made written request and offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
(including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any,
or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of any of the Senior Secured

279


-----

Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the SSN Indenture or
any remedy thereunder, unless:

(a) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes have made written request to, and offered indemnity
and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to, the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as trustee under the Senior Secured Notes and the
SSN Indenture;

(b) the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after receipt
of such written notice and offer of indemnity and/or security (including by way
of prefunding); and

(c) the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions inconsistent
with such written request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes. Such limitations do not, however,
apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Senior Secured Note for the
enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional
Amounts or interest on such Senior Secured Note on or after the respective
due dates expressed in such Senior Secured Note.

(8) The SSN Indenture will provide that if a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will deliver to each holder of the Senior Secured Notes notice of the Default or
Event of Default within 30 Business Days of receipt of such notice. Except in the case
of a Default or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional
Amounts or interest on any Senior Secured Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice
to the holders of such Senior Secured Notes if a committee of its trust officers in good
faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes.

(9) The SSN Issuer is required to furnish to the Trustee annual statements regarding
compliance with the SSN Indenture and as to the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default. The SSN Issuer is also required to notify the Trustee in writing within 30 days
of the occurrence of any Default (unless cured) or Event of Default, specifying the
events giving rise to the occurrence of the Default or Event of Default and stating what
action, if any, it is taking with respect to such Default or Event of Default.

(10) The SSN Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the
time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required
certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further
action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Provision of Information” or otherwise to
deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this SSN Indenture
shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery, prior to acceleration in respect of the
relevant breach, of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate,
as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified
in the SSN Indenture.

(11) Prior to taking any action under the SSN Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the
Trustee in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal
fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. The Trustee shall have no obligation
to monitor compliance by the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor with the SSN Indenture.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of SSN Indenture**

The SSN Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes issued under an SSN Indenture and all obligations of the Guarantors
discharged with respect to their applicable Note Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Senior Secured Notes to receive payments in
respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Senior Secured Notes
(including Additional Amounts, if any) when such payments are due from the trust
referred to below;

(b) the SSN Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Senior Secured Notes, register,
transfer or exchange any Senior Secured Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Senior Secured Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of
the Senior Secured Notes and segregate and hold such payments in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of
the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the SSN Indenture.

If the SSN Issuer exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, the SSN Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of
the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including, without
limitation, its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Excess Proceeds Offers) set forth in the
SSN Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants
will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. In the event
Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under “—Events of Default” will no longer
constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. These events do not include
events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to the SSN Issuer, bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership and reorganization. The SSN Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless
of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the SSN Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with the
Trustee (or such other entity nominated by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit
of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case, in such amounts as
will be sufficient, in the opinion of internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal
firm or firm of independent public accountants taking into account the effect of any
hedging arrangements entered into in connection with such deposit, to pay and
discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Amounts,
if any) on the outstanding Senior Secured Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the SSN Issuer must (x) specify
whether the Senior Secured Notes are being defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a
particular redemption date; and (y) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an
irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such principal,
premium, if any, or interest;

281


-----

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the SSN Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee
an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the SSN Issuer has received from, or there has
been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the Issue
Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case
to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial
owners of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income Tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at
the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the SSN Issuer must have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income Tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) the SSN Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that
the deposit was not made by the SSN Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes over the other creditors of the SSN Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the SSN Issuer or others; and

(e) the SSN Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal
Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The SSN Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Senior
Secured Notes issued thereunder when:

(a) either:

(I) all the Senior Secured Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other
than destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes that have been replaced
or paid and Senior Secured Notes for whose payment money has been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust and thereafter repaid to the
SSN Issuer or discharged from such trust as provided for in the SSN Indenture)
have been delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Trustee) for
cancellation; or

(II) all Senior Secured Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent (and
notified to the Trustee) for cancellation (x) have become due and payable (by
reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise), (y) will become
due and payable within one year or (z) are to be called for redemption within
one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the SSN
Issuer and the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity nominated by the
Trustee for this purpose) as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case in such

282


-----

amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of
interest, to pay and discharge the entire Debt on the Senior Secured Notes not
delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Trustee) for cancellation for
principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption; and

(b) the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
by the SSN Issuer under the SSN Indenture; and

(c) the SSN Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Paying Agent (copied to
the Trustee) under the SSN Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be.

In addition, the SSN Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided in the SSN Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the SSN Indenture have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel
may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (a), (b) and (c)).

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the SSN Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents, any Proceeds Loan, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the

or compliance with any provision of the SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor

_however, that if any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the_
Floating Rate Notes, only the consent of holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, and not the consent of holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of all Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, will be required.

However, without the consent of the holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes (including without limitation, consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes), or if any amendment,
supplement or waiver will only affect one series of the Senior Secured Notes, without the consent of
holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Notes of such series so amended, supplemented or waived, an amendment, supplement or waiver may
not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting holder:

(a) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of or interest or
Additional Amounts on, any Senior Secured Note;

described thereunder;

(k) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Senior Secured Note (other than a

each Senior Secured Note affected thereby; or

(m) make any change in the preceding provisions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of the Senior Secured Notes,
the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent and the Trustee (as applicable)
may modify, amend or supplement the SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Note Guarantees,

they are party:

(a) to cure any ambiguity, omission, error, defect or inconsistency;

(b) increase the amount or types of Debt covered by any such agreement that may be
Incurred under the SSN Indenture by the SSN Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to

if permitted by, the terms and limitations set forth in the SSN Indenture.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an
Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s Certificate on which the Trustee and/or the Security Agent may
solely rely.

The consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes is not necessary under the SSN
Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Senior Secured Notes owned
by the SSN Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or
indirect common control with, the SSN Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured
Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The SSN Indenture will
provide that, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its rights and powers
vested in it by the SSN Indenture, to use the degree of care of a prudent man would exercise or use
under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will
be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the SSN Indenture at the request of
any holder of Senior Secured Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The SSN Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the Trustee for any loss,
liability, Taxes or expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising
out of or in connection with its duties.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange. There
can be no guarantee that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange will be
approved as of the Issue Date or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is
not conditioned on obtaining this listing. The SSN Issuer has initially designated Banque Internationale
à Luxembourg SA as its listing agent (the “Listing Agent”). The address of the Listing Agent is 69 route
d’Esch, L-1470 Luxembourg.

**Listing and General Information**

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of
Luxembourg Stock Exchange shall so require, copies, current and future, of all of our annual audited
consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements, our unaudited consolidated interim quarterly
financial statements and this Offering Memorandum may be obtained, free of charge, during normal
business hours at the registered office of the SSN Issuer.

Anyone who receives this Offering Memorandum may, following the Issue Date, obtain a copy
of the SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without charge by writing to the SSN Issuer at 34, rue Mozart
– Immeuble Le Cassiopée 92110 Clichy, France.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the SSN Issuer or any
Guarantor will have any liability for any obligations of the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors under the Senior
Secured Notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents or the SSN Indenture or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each holder, by accepting a Senior
Secured Note, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective
to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

**Prescription**

Claims against the SSN Issuer or the Guarantors for the payment of principal or premiums, if
any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment
thereof. Claims against the SSN Issuer or the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Governing Law**

The SSN Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and will provide for the submission of
the parties to the jurisdiction of the courts in the State of New York. The Security Documents will be
governed by the laws of France. Each Proceeds Loan and the Upstream Proceeds Loan will be
governed by the laws of France.

287


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

The SSN Indenture will provide that the SSN Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint Law
Debenture Corporate Services, Inc. 801 2[nd] Avenue Suite 403 New York, NY 10017, as their agent for
service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the SSN Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes, as the case may be, and for actions brought under U.S. Federal or state securities laws
brought in any Federal or state court located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since most of the assets of the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors are outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts,
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be

296


-----

with the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio

“Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to a specified Person for any
period, the ratio of the Consolidated EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of
such Person for such period. In the event that the specified Person or any Restricted Subsidiary which
is a Subsidiary of such specified Person incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems,
defeases or otherwise discharges any Debt (other than ordinary working capital borrowings) or issues,
repurchases or redeems preferred stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the
event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (for the
purpose of this definition, the “Calculation Date”) (but not giving effect to (i) any additional Debt to be
incurred on the Calculation Date as part of the same transaction or series of transactions pursuant to
paragraph (2) under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” (other than with respect to
clause (k) of such covenant) or (ii) the discharge on the date of determination of any Debt to the extent
that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to paragraph (2) under the caption “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”), then the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be_
calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by an Officer or a responsible financial
or accounting officer of the SSN Issuer) to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment,
repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Debt, or such issuance, repurchase or
redemption of preferred stock, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at
the beginning of the applicable four-quarter reference period. In addition, for purposes of calculating the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio:

(a) acquisitions of any Person, business or group of assets that constitutes an operating
unit or division of business that have been made by such Person or any of its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, including through mergers,
consolidations, amalgamations or otherwise, or by any Person or any of its Subsidiaries
which are Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by such specified Person or any of its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, and including all related financing
transactions and including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted
Subsidiaries (including Persons who become Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such
increase), during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference
period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation
Date, will be given _pro forma_ effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the SSN Issuer and may include anticipated expense
and cost reduction and cost saving synergies) as if they had occurred on the first day
of the four-quarter reference period;

(b) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein)
disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded;

(c) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of
prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded, but only to the extent that the obligations
giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be obligations of such specified Person or
any Restricted Subsidiary which is a Subsidiary of such specified Person following the
Calculation Date;

(d) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to
have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(e) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed
not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period;
and

297


-----

(f) if any Debt bears a floating rate of interest and such Debt is to be given pro forma effect,
the interest expense on such Debt will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account
any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Debt if such Hedging Obligation has a
remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of 12 months, or, if shorter, at least
equal to the remaining term of such Debt).

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated
Adjusted Net Income and Fixed Charges, calculations will be as determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the SSN Issuer.

“Consolidated Net Leverage” means, with respect to a specified Person as of any date of
determination, (x) the aggregate amount of Debt of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries

basis _minus (y) the aggregate amount of cash and Cash Equivalents (other than cash or Cash_
Equivalents received upon the incurrence of Debt by such Person or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
and not immediately or subsequently applied or used for any purpose not prohibited by the SSN
Indenture) that would be stated on the balance sheet of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries as
of such date in accordance with IFRS (including, for the avoidance of doubt, cash and Cash Equivalents
held by BH on behalf of the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the BH Cash
Management Agreement, but only if and to the extent recorded as cash and Cash Equivalents on the
balance sheet of the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of such date in accordance with
IFRS).

“Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” means, with respect to a specified Person, as of any date
of determination, the ratio of (a) the Consolidated Net Leverage of such Person on such date to (b) the
Consolidated EBITDA of such Person for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding such date. In the event that such
Person or any Subsidiary of such Person which is a Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, assumes, guarantees,
repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Debt (other than ordinary working

**DESCRIPTION OF THE PIK NOTES**

Midco GB, a _société par actions simplifiée organized under the laws of France (the “PIK_
_Issuer”), will issue €   million in aggregate principal amount of     % /     % senior PIK toggle notes_
due 2027 (the “PIK Notes”), under an indenture to be dated on or about November 2, 2021 (the “PIK
_Indenture”), among, inter alios, the PIK Issuer, Topco GB and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as trustee_
(the “Trustee”) and as security agent (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject
to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The term “PIK Notes”
refers also to Book-Entry Interests (as defined below) in the PIK Notes. Except as set forth herein, the
terms of the PIK Notes include those set forth in the PIK Indenture.

The definitions of certain terms used in this description are set forth under the subheading “—
_Certain Definitions”. Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—_
_Certain Definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in the PIK Indenture. In this “Description of_
_the PIK Notes,” references to (i) the “PIK Issuer” refer only to Midco GB and not to any of its_
Subsidiaries; (ii) “we,” “our,” “us” refer to the PIK Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and (iii)
“Company” refers only to Burger King France SAS and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The terms of the PIK Notes include those set forth in the PIK Indenture. The PIK Indenture will
not be qualified under, and will not be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
“TIA”). Consequently, the holders of the PIK Notes generally will not be entitled to the protections
provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those
requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform the holders of
the PIK Notes of certain relationships between it and the PIK Issuer. The Security Documents referred
to below under the caption “—Security” define the terms of the security that will secure the PIK Notes.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the PIK Indenture and the PIK
Notes and refers to the Security Documents and certain other agreements relating to the PIK Notes. It
does not, however, restate any of those agreements in their entirety. You should read the PIK Indenture,
the PIK Notes and the Security Documents because they, and not this description, define your rights
as a holder of the PIK Notes. Copies of the PIK Indenture, the form of the PIK Global Notes (as defined
below) and the Security Documents may be obtained upon request from the PIK Issuer as set forth
below under “Listing and General Information”.

The PIK Issuer will make an application for the PIK Notes to be admitted to the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Euro MTF Market”). The PIK Issuer can provide no assurance that
such application will be accepted. Please see “—Payments on the PIK Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar
_and Transfer Agent for the PIK Notes”._

**Additional PIK Notes**

From time to time, the PIK Issuer is permitted to issue Additional PIK Notes. The PIK Issuer will
only be permitted to issue Additional PIK Notes in compliance with the covenants described under the
headings “—Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants — Limitation
_on Liens,” and as described in “—Terms of the PIK Notes” and “Additional Amounts”. Except as_
otherwise provided for in the PIK Indenture, the PIK Notes and, if issued, Additional PIK Notes will be
treated as a single class for all purposes under the PIK Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided, however, that a series
of Additional PIK Notes that is not, in the reasonable judgment of the PIK Issuer, fungible with the PIK
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate CUSIP, ISIN or other identifying
number from the PIK Notes of such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the
“PIK Notes” for all purposes of the PIK Indenture and this “Description of the PIK Notes” includes
references to any Additional PIK Notes that are actually issued under the PIK Indenture.

322


-----

The registered holder of a PIK Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered holders will have rights under the PIK Indenture.

**Terms of the PIK Notes**

The PIK Notes will be senior obligations of the PIK Issuer and will mature on   , 2027. Each
PIK Note will bear interest at a rate of     % per annum in the case of Cash Interest (as defined below)
or, if PIK Interest (as defined below) is payable, at a rate of    % per annum. Interest will accrue from
the Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for payable
semi-annually to holders of record at the close of business on    or    immediately preceding the
interest payment date on    or     of each year, commencing on    . Interest will be computed on
the basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

In the case of payment of PIK Interest, including in the event of payment of Additional Amounts,
the PIK Issuer may elect to either increase the outstanding principal amount of the PIK Notes or issue
Additional PIK Notes under the PIK Indenture having the same terms as the PIK Notes offered hereby
(in each case a “PIK Payment”). The PIK Notes and the Additional PIK Notes that are actually issued
will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the PIK Indenture, including waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase.

Except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence and the definition of “Cash
_Available for_ _Debt Service”, interest on the PIK Notes shall be payable entirely in cash (“Cash Interest”)._
For any interest period after the first two interest periods (other than the final interest period ending at
stated maturity), if Cash Available for Debt Service as determined by the PIK Issuer or a relevant
Restricted Subsidiary on the Determination Date for such interest period:

(i) equals or exceeds 75%, but is less than 100%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest
that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the PIK Issuer may, at its
option, elect to pay interest on up to 25% of the then outstanding principal amount of the PIK Notes by
increasing the principal amount of the outstanding PIK Notes or by issuing Additional PIK Notes in a
principal amount equal to such interest (“PIK _Interest”);_

(ii) is equal to or exceeds 50%, but is less than 75%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest
that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the PIK Issuer may, at its
option, elect to pay interest on up to 50% of the then outstanding principal amount of the PIK Notes as
PIK Interest;

(iii) is equal to or exceeds 25%, but is less than 50%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest
that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the PIK Issuer may, at its
option, elect to pay interest on up to 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the PIK Notes as
PIK Interest; or

(iv) is less than 25% of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on
the relevant interest payment date, then the PIK Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to
100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the PIK Notes as PIK Interest,

provided that if, for the period starting on the 45th day preceding the relevant interest payment date and
ending on the 15th day preceding such interest payment date, the aggregate amount of cash and Cash
Equivalents of the PIK Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries has an average daily balance which is less
than the sum of (i) the greater of €75.0 million and 43.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Company, (ii)
any amount which cannot be, or which it is uneconomical to be, upstreamed to the PIK Issuer due to
local limitations (including foreign exchange controls or tax cost) or which is required to be retained by
law or regulation or to maintain the corporate existence or tax basis of the PIK Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or debt service (including pursuant to cash sweep requirements), (iii) any

323


-----

declared but unpaid dividends or other distributions and (iv) any amounts payable to or in connection
with any management or employee equity or incentive arrangement of the PIK Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (the “Minimum Free Cash Balance”), determined on a pro forma basis giving
effect to the payment of any Cash Interest payable under the PIK Notes on such interest payment date
and, pro rata for the economic interest of the PIK Issuer in the Capital Stock of the Company or the IPO
Entity, as applicable, then the PIK Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay PIK Interest on the PIK Notes
in such amount so that the Minimum Free Cash Balance would have been maintained over the same
period and determined on the same basis. In such circumstances the PIK Issuer or a relevant Restricted
Subsidiary shall deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee and the Paying Agent on or prior to the
date falling five days prior to the relevant interest payment date, which certificate shall state the total
amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid
as PIK Interest and reasonable details of the determination of such calculation. The Trustee or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly deliver the same notice to the holders of record.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, the PIK Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay Cash
Interest even if it would be entitled to pay PIK Interest.

The Minimum Cash Balance shall be calculated and determined in each case, without
duplication, (i) excluding amounts drawn in cash and outstanding under (A) the New Revolving Credit
Facility and (B) any factoring, local working capital or overdraft facilities, and (ii) on a pro forma basis to
give effect to the payment of the anticipated cash purchase price for any acquisitions committed to but
not yet funded (excluding any portion of the purchase price for such acquisitions that is expected to be
funded by way of the incurrence of Debt for which a commitment is outstanding on the Determination
Date). The insufficiency or lack of funds available to the PIK Issuer to pay Cash Interest as required by
the immediately preceding paragraph shall not permit the PIK Issuer to pay PIK Interest in respect of
any interest period, and the sole right of the PIK Issuer to elect to pay PIK Interest shall be as (and to
the extent) provided in the immediately preceding paragraph.

For the purposes of the PIK Indenture:

“Cash Available for Debt Service” shall be the amount equal to the sum (without duplication) of:

(a) (i) all cash and Cash Equivalents on hand at the PIK Issuer as of such
Determination Date (other than any cash and Cash Equivalents the distribution of which
was conditioned upon such cash and Cash Equivalents being used for a purpose other
than paying Cash Interest and other than an amount necessary to be retained by the
PIK Issuer by law or regulation or to maintain the corporate existence or tax basis of
the PIK Issuer and its Subsidiaries and to carry out activities not prohibited by the PIK
Notes or the PIK Indenture (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of
interest on any Debt of the PIK Issuer that is permitted to be Incurred under the
covenant “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”)) (which amount shall in no event
be less than zero), provided that there shall be excluded from this clause (i) any cash
and Cash Equivalents at the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than a
Permitted Subsidiary) as at the Issue Date, the proceeds from the PIK Notes (other
than, to the extent otherwise included, amounts deposited in the Cash Interest Account)
and any cash and Cash Equivalents to be used for payment of interest on the PIK Notes
on the interest payment date immediately succeeding such Determination Date; and

(b) (ii) the maximum amount of all dividends and other distributions that, as of the
applicable Determination Date, would be lawfully permitted to be paid to the PIK Issuer
as cash and Cash Equivalents for the purposes of paying Cash Interest on the PIK
Notes by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (calculated (x) excluding any
amounts payable to or in connection with any management or employee equity or
incentive arrangement and (y) pro rata for the economic interest of the PIK Issuer in the
Capital Stock of Company or the IPO Entity), if any (after giving effect to all corporate,
shareholder or other comparable actions (including fiduciary and other directors’ duties)
required in order to make such payment, requirements under applicable law and

324


-----

regulation, the maintenance of corporate existence or tax basis and all restrictions or
limitations on the ability to make such dividends or distributions that are otherwise
permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” (including,_
without limitation, any restrictions and limitations in any Credit Facility, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, other Indebtedness of the PIK Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries and any related documents and any other financing or other contractual
arrangements of any Restricted Subsidiary of the PIK Issuer or any agreement that
amends, modifies, renews, increases, supplements, refunds, replaces or refinances
such debt or such financing or contractual arrangements) pursuant to the “consolidated
net income”, “general basket” or “leverage ratio-based basket” under the “restricted
payments” covenant (but excluding all other carve-outs and baskets) and similar
restrictive covenants and provisions contained in any Credit Facility, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or any other agreement or instrument governing
Indebtedness of the PIK Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries the terms of which
do not violate the PIK Indenture, and any other financing or other contractual
arrangements of any Restricted Subsidiaries of the PIK Issuer or any agreement that
amends, modifies, renews, increases, supplements, refunds, replaces or refinances
such debt or such financing or contractual arrangements), net of all fees, costs,
expenses and taxes attributable to such dividend or distribution or payment, if any.

The amount of cash and Cash Equivalents of, or on hand at, the PIK Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries as of any Determination Date for purposes of determining whether such amount exceeds
the Minimum Free Cash Balance or calculating the amount of Cash Available for Debt Service shall
include, for the avoidance of doubt, cash and Cash Equivalents held by BH on behalf of the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries on such date pursuant to the BH Cash Management Agreement, but
only if and to the extent recorded as cash and Cash Equivalents on the balance sheet of the PIK Issuer
at the time of such determination or calculation.

To the extent the PIK Issuer is required to pay Cash Interest for all or any portion of the interest
due on any interest payment date, the PIK Issuer shall, including by exercising all its voting and other
rights and powers as direct or indirect shareholder of its Restricted Subsidiaries and by causing each
director thereof nominated by it to exercise all such person’s rights as director to cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, but subject to fiduciary or other directors’ duties or any legal or regulatory
impediments, permit the making of any such dividends or other distribution or other form of return on
capital, provided that any such shareholder and corporate and other actions would not violate applicable
law or regulation.

“Determination Date”’ shall mean, with respect to each interest period (excluding the first two
interest periods and the final interest period ending at the stated maturity of the PIK Notes), the day
falling 10 calendar days immediately prior to the first day of the relevant interest period.

In the event that the PIK Issuer is entitled to pay PIK Interest for any interest period, then the
PIK Issuer or a relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall deliver a notice to the Trustee and the Paying Agent
following the Determination Date but not less than five calendar days prior to the commencement of the
relevant interest period, which notice shall state the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest
payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid as PIK Interest. The Trustee or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly deliver the same notice to the holders of the PIK Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of such notice to the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not
restrict the PIK Issuer’s ability to pay, at its option, a greater portion of the interest on the PIK Notes
with respect to such interest period as Cash Interest, in which case the PIK Issuer or a relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall deliver a notice to that effect to the Trustee and each Paying Agent no later
than five calendar days prior to the interest payment date of the relevant interest period.

325


-----

Interest for the first two interest periods shall be payable entirely in Cash Interest. Interest for
the final interest period ending at the stated maturity of the PIK Notes shall be payable entirely in Cash
Interest.

The PIK Issuer will make all interest payments, if payable in the form of Cash Interest, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying Agent, for onward payment to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the PIK Global Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. Interest, if
payable in the form of Additional PIK Notes, on the PIK Global Notes will be payable by the PIK Issuer
delivering an order to increase the principal amount of any such PIK Global Note by the relevant amount
(rounded up to the nearest whole euro) or, if necessary, by issuing a new PIK Global Note executed by
the PIK Issuer and an order to the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) to authenticate such new PIK
Global Note under the PIK Indenture. Interest, if payable in the form of Additional PIK Notes, on any
PIK Definitive Registered Notes will be payable by the PIK Issuer delivering to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent such Additional PIK Notes in the relevant amount (rounded up to the nearest whole euro)
as definitive registered PIK Notes and an order to authenticate such PIK Notes. If the PIK Issuer pays
a portion of the interest on the PIK Notes as Cash Interest and the remainder as PIK Interest, such
Cash Interest and PIK Interest shall be paid to Holders _pro rata in accordance with their interests._
Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding PIK Global Notes as a result of a
payment as PIK Interest, the PIK Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from and
after the date of such payment.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the PIK Notes to receive the payments of interest
on the PIK Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. If
the due date for any payment in respect of any PIK Note is not a Business Day at the place at which
such payment is due to be paid, the holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due
until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or
other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Brief Description of the PIK Notes**

The PIK Notes:

    - will be general obligations of the PIK Issuer;

    - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of the PIK Issuer that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the PIK Notes;

    - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Debt of the PIK Issuer that is
subordinated in right of payment to the PIK Notes;

    - will not be guaranteed;

    - will be secured by senior Liens over the Collateral as described below under “—Security”;

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of the PIK Issuer that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the PIK Notes, to the extent of the value
of the property and assets securing such Debt; and

    - will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries.

326


-----

The operations of the PIK Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the PIK
Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under
the PIK Notes. Holders of the PIK Notes do not have a direct claim on the cashflow or assets of the PIK
Issuer’s Subsidiaries and the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries do not have any obligation, contingent or
otherwise, to pay amounts due under the PIK Notes or to make funds available to the PIK Issuer for
those purposes. Certain legal and contractual restrictions limit the PIK Issuer’s ability to access the
cashflow of its Subsidiaries, including legal restrictions on the payment of corporate dividends as well
as restrictions on the payment of corporate dividends under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the PIK Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of
payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease
obligations) of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Any right of the PIK Issuer to receive assets of any of its
Subsidiaries upon that Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the
holders of the PIK Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of
that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the PIK Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of
the Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the PIK Issuer would still be subordinated in right of payment
to any security in the assets of the Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary that is senior to
that owing to the PIK Issuer.

None of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries will provide a guarantee of the PIK Notes.

At August 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Offering and the application
of the proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the PIK Issuer would have had total
debt of €235.0 million. At August 31, 2021, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have
had €1,135.4 million of indebtedness outstanding, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to
the PIK Notes, and €80.0 million of undrawn availability under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

As of the Issue Date, all of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for
purposes of the PIK Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the PIK Issuer will be
permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the PIK Issuer will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the PIK Indenture
and will not guarantee the PIK Notes.

**Cash Interest Account**

The PIK Issuer will deposit into a segregated bank account in the name of the PIK Issuer (the
“Cash Interest _Account”) a portion of the net proceeds of the issuance of the PIK Notes on the Issue_
Date in an amount sufficient to enable the PIK Issuer to pay Cash Interest on the PIK Notes for each of
the first two interest periods following the Issue Date.

To secure payment of such Cash Interest on each applicable interest payment date and the
PIK Issuer’s other payment obligations under the PIK Notes, the PIK Issuer will grant security over the
Cash Interest Account pursuant to an account pledge (the “Account Pledge”).

The PIK Issuer shall be entitled, pursuant to the terms of the Account Pledge, at any time and
from time to time, to require the release of all or any part of the funds deposited in the Cash Interest
Account (including accrued interest on such amounts) in order to make certain payments, including
payment of Cash Interest, on or in connection with the PIK Notes. The Account Pledge will be
automatically released in certain circumstances.

**Payments on the PIK Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the PIK Notes**

The PIK Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the PIK
Notes for so long as the PIK Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC.

The PIK Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and one or more
transfer agents (each, a “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.
The initial transfer agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent,
as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of PIK Definitive Registered Notes (as defined
herein) outstanding from time to time (the “Register”) and will make payments on and facilitate transfer
of PIK Definitive Registered Notes on the behalf of the PIK Issuer.

The PIK Issuer may change the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent without prior
notice to the holders of PIK Notes. For so long as the PIK Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and
regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the PIK Issuer will publish a notice of any
change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the _Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner_
permitted by such rules and regulations, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of
the PIK Notes, but the PIK Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer Tax or
similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange
(but not for a redemption).

**Form of PIK Notes**

The PIK Notes will be issued on the Issue Date only in fully registered form without coupons
and only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof.

PIK Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) will initially be represented by a PIK Global Note (as defined
below) in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A PIK Global Note”). The 144A
PIK Global Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. PIK
Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by a PIK Global Note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S _PIK Global Note” and, together with the 144A PIK Global Note, the “PIK Global Notes”)._
The Regulation S PIK Global Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream. Please see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The PIK Global Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the PIK Indenture. Ownership
of interests in the PIK Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject
to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective

328


-----

participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A PIK Global Note (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”)
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S PIK Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the
transferor to the Registrar of a written certification (in the form provided in the PIK Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding
paragraph will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the PIK Global Note from which it
was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the PIK Global Note to which it was
transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions,
if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the PIK Global Note to which it was
transferred.

If definitive notes in registered form (“PIK Definitive Registered Notes”) are issued, they will be
issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1 in
excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and
other documentation required by the PIK Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based
upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns
the relevant Book-Entry Interests. PIK Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the PIK Indenture or as otherwise determined by the PIK Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on
transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, PIK Notes issued as PIK Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery
thereof in the form of PIK Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange,
the PIK Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the
transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions, and
pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be
made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or
exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the PIK Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any PIK
Definitive Registered Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the PIK Notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of PIK Notes to
be redeemed in part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment
date; or

(d) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer, Excess Proceeds Offer or Notes Offer.

The PIK Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements,
as described under “Transfer Restrictions”.

329


-----

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the PIK Issuer on the PIK Notes will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless
the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for,
or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of

(1) any jurisdiction in which the PIK Issuer is then incorporated or organized, engaged in
business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax or

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the PIK Issuer
(including the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the PIK Notes) or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Tax Jurisdiction”)

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the PIK
Issuer on the PIK Notes, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the PIK
Issuer will pay such additional amounts in the form of (i) in the case of Cash Interest or other cash
payments, cash or (ii) in the case of PIK Interest, Additional PIK Notes (the “Additional Amounts”) as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder
of PIK Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such
Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received by the holder in
respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no
Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence
of any actual or deemed present or former connection between the holder or the
beneficial owner of the PIK Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner
of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, nominee,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being or having been a resident, citizen or national of such
jurisdiction or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business there or
having or having had a permanent establishment therein for Tax purposes), but
excluding any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of
such PIK Note, the enforcement of rights under such PIK Note or the receipt of any
payments in respect of such PIK Note;

(b) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a
PIK Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent
that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the PIK Note been
presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes, or
excise taxes imposed on the transfer of PIK Notes;

(d) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial
owner of PIK Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction
by presenting the relevant PIK Notes to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another
Paying Agent;

330


-----

(e) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments on the PIK
Notes;

(f) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of
the holder or beneficial owner of PIK Notes, to comply with a reasonable written request
by the PIK Issuer (or any person acting on its behalf) addressed to the holder or
beneficial owner (and made at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction
at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply
with that request), to provide information concerning the nationality, residency or
identity of such holder or beneficial owner of the PIK Notes or to comply with any
certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether
required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as
a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding
of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification
that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each
case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(g) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the PIK Issuer to the holder
if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial
owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such
payment had the beneficial owner been the holder of such PIK Note;

(h) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code,
as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that are
substantively comparable), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or
official interpretations thereof and any agreements (including any law implementing any
such agreement or any intergovernmental agreements between a non-U.S. jurisdiction
and the United States with respect to the foregoing and any law, regulation, or official
interpretation thereof implementing such intergovernmental agreement) entered into
pursuant thereto; or

(i) any combination of items (a) through (h) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the PIK Issuer will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present
or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes,
charges or similar levies (including penalties and interest) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on
the execution, delivery, issuance, initial resale, enforcement or registration of any of the PIK Notes, the
PIK Indenture or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of PIK Notes other than
the initial resale by the initial purchasers), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited,
solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such
Taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (d) or (f) through
(h) above or any combination thereof), or any such Taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any
jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the PIK Notes.

If the PIK Issuer becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect
to any payment on the PIK Notes, the PIK Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (copied to the Paying Agent)
on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the PIK Issuer shall notify
the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any
other information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to
holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely
on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

331


-----

The PIK Issuer will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law
and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax
authority in accordance with applicable law. The PIK Issuer will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax
receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The
PIK Issuer will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes
so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the PIK Issuer
or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence
of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably requested by the
Trustee or the Paying Agent, the PIK Issuer will provide to the Trustee or the Paying Agent such
information as may be in the possession of the PIK Issuer (and not otherwise in the possession of the
Trustee or the Paying Agent) to enable the Trustee or the Paying Agent to determine the amount of
withholding Taxes attributable to any particular holder; provided, however, that in no event shall the PIK
Issuer be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential.

Whenever in the PIK Indenture or in this “Description of the PIK Notes” there is mentioned, in
any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the PIK Notes, of principal,
redemption or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the PIK Notes, of interest
or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the PIK Notes, such mention shall be
deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the PIK
Indenture or any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its PIK Notes, and will apply, _mutatis_
_mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the PIK Issuer is incorporated, engaged_
in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such
Person makes any payment on the PIK Notes and any department or political subdivision thereof or
therein.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the PIK Notes will be secured by security interests granted on an equal and
ratable first-ranking basis over the following property, rights and assets (collectively, the “Collateral”):

    - the Cash Interest Account pursuant to the terms of the Account Pledge; and

    - the financial securities account (nantissement de compte-titres) to which the shares and
securities of the PIK Issuer owned by Topco GB are credited (amounting to 100% of the
outstanding share capital of the PIK Issuer as of the Issue Date).

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the PIK Issuer and Topco GB
to secure the payment when due of the PIK Issuer’s payment obligations under the PIK Notes and the
PIK Indenture. The Security Documents with respect to the Collateral will be entered into by, inter alios,
the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the Trustee and the holders of
PIK Notes.

Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests in France, the relevant Security Documents will provide for the creation of “parallel debt”
obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the
parallel debt (and not the Debt under the PIK Notes and the other secured obligations). The parallel
debt construct has not been fully tested under law in France. See “Certain Insolvency Law

332


-----

_Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests—France—_
_Parallel Debt—Trust”._

Each holder of PIK Notes, by accepting a PIK Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the
Security Agent (and, if applicable, the Trustee) to enter into the Security Documents and (ii) to be bound
thereby. Each holder of PIK Notes, by accepting a PIK Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent,
as the case may be, as its agent under the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such.

The holders of the PIK Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders
may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the
Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent (as creditor
of the parallel debt, in respect of the Security Documents governed by French law), as applicable. The
Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents (the
“Security Interests”) that is in accordance with the PIK Indenture without requiring any consent of the
holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action
under the Security Documents in accordance with the PIK Indenture.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral,
the PIK Issuer and the PIK Holdco Security Providers, as the case may be, will have the right to remain
in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the PIK Notes, and, in respect of
the shares that are part of the Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to
receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash
dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options
and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing).

The value of the Collateral securing the PIK Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the PIK
Issuer’s obligations under the PIK Notes, and the Collateral securing the PIK Notes may be reduced or
diluted in the event of the issuance of Additional PIK Notes (as described under “—Additional PIK
_Notes”, “—Terms of PIK Notes” or “—Additional Amounts”) and the disposition of assets comprising the_
Collateral, subject to the terms of the PIK Indenture. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral_
_may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”._

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the PIK Issuer in
connection with this Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral,
in whole or in part, pursuant to the PIK Indenture and the Security Documents following an Event of
Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the PIK Notes. By its nature, some or all the
Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all.

The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France and provide that the rights with
respect to the PIK Notes and the PIK Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and, in each
case, in respect of the entire outstanding amount of the PIK Notes. The term “Security Interests” refers
to the Liens on the Collateral.

The PIK Issuer shall, and shall procure that the PIK Holdco Security Providers shall, at their
own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security
Agent or the Trustee, as applicable, may require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to
the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded
by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in
accordance with the terms of the PIK Indenture and the relevant Security Document, for facilitating the
realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating
the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of
all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the PIK Issuer and the PIK Holdco Security Providers shall
execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the

333


-----

Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent
may request.

**_Release of the Security_**

The Collateral will be released from the Liens over the Collateral under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(a) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien
securing the PIK Notes (the “Notes Lien”) under the covenant described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” so long as immediately after the
release of the Notes Lien there is no other Debt secured by a Lien on the property and
assets that were the subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the
requirement for the PIK Notes to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such
Lien;

(b) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the PIK Issuer
under the PIK Indenture and the PIK Notes;

(c) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(d) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;

(e) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the PIK
Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant
_Defeasance of PIK Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(f) in the case of a security enforcement sale in the release of the property and assets
subject to such enforcement sale;

(g) solely with respect to the Account Pledge, as described under “—Cash Interest
_Account”; and_

(h) with respect to any Liens over Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer, in connection with or in
contemplation or anticipation of an IPO Event or an issuance or sale of Capital Stock
of the PIK Issuer, upon the delivery of an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee and the
Security Agent confirming that such release would be reasonably necessary (in the
good faith judgment of the signing Officer) to enable the prompt and expeditious release
of such Liens prior to the settlement of the relevant transaction pursuant to the
procedures and customs of the relevant securities exchange, having regard (among
other things) to the clearing, settlement and custodial arrangements and procedures of
the relevant securities exchange, provided that in the event that Liens over such Capital
Stock are released pursuant to this paragraph and such IPO Event or sale does not
occur within the time period contemplated in the associated underwriting, sale,
purchase or other relevant agreement or within a reasonable time period thereafter, the
PIK Issuer shall cause the PIK Holdco Security Providers to grant a similar Lien in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the PIK Notes as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter.

Following written request by the PIK Issuer, and at the expense of the PIK Issuer, the Security
Agent and, if necessary, the Trustee will take all necessary action required to effect any release of

334


-----

Collateral securing the PIK Notes, in accordance with the provisions of the PIK Indenture and the
relevant Security Documents, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or
any action on the part of the Trustee. The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request
and rely conclusively upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred and
that such release complies with the PIK Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

On and after   , 2024 the PIK Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the PIK
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption prices
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on    of the years indicated
below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2024 ........................................................................................................................ %
2025 ........................................................................................................................ %
2026 and thereafter................................................................................................. 100.000%

Prior to   , 2024, the PIK Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the PIK Notes
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the PIK Notes so redeemed plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date).

**Special Mandatory Redemptions—IPO Event**

At any time prior to   , 2023, if an IPO Event has occurred the PIK Issuer shall redeem the
PIK Notes with the net cash proceeds received by the PIK Issuer from sales by the PIK Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the secondary market of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock)
of the IPO Entity (net of the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments made by the PIK Issuer
pursuant to clause 3(r) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” prior to the date of such redemption (excluding amounts of such Restricted_
Payments that were already netted against the amounts to be paid for redemptions under this paragraph
that occurred prior to such redemption), such redemption to occur within 120 days of receipt thereof,
and upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 102% of the
aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date).

In addition, between   , 2023 and  , 2024 if an IPO Event has occurred the PIK Issuer
shall redeem the PIK Notes with the net cash proceeds received by the PIK Issuer from sales by the
PIK Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the secondary market of Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the IPO Entity (net of the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments made by

right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) for up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes originally issued and
(ii) a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes being
redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the
applicable redemption date for the remaining principal amount of the PIK Notes (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date that is prior to the redemption date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date).

Finally, on and after   , 2024, if an IPO Event has occurred the PIK Issuer shall redeem the
PIK Notes with the net cash proceeds received by the PIK Issuer from sales by the PIK Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the secondary market of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock)
of the IPO Entity (net of the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments made by the PIK Issuer
pursuant to clause 3(r) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” prior to the date of such redemption (excluding amounts of such Restricted_
Payments that were already netted against the amounts to be paid for redemptions under this paragraph
that occurred prior to such redemption), such redemption to occur within 120 days of receipt thereof
and upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on    of the years indicated below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2024 .......................................................................................................................... %
2025 .......................................................................................................................... %
2026 and thereafter................................................................................................... 100.000%

Any such redemption may, at the PIK Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including the completion of and receipt of funds from the sale of such Capital Stock. In
addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
such notice shall state that, in the PIK Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until
such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the PIK Issuer in its sole
discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any
or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date
so delayed. In addition, the PIK Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price
and performance of the PIK Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by
another Person.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. If the
PIK Issuer effects an optional redemption of PIK Notes, it will, for so long as the PIK Notes of such
series are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the
aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes of such series that will remain outstanding immediately
after such redemption.

If the redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the PIK Note
is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
holders whose PIK Notes will be subject to redemption by the PIK Issuer.

**Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Other than a Special Mandatory Redemption or as set forth above under the caption “—Special
_Mandatory Redemption—IPO Event,” the PIK Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption_

336


-----

or sinking fund payments with respect to the PIK Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the PIK
Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the PIK Notes as described under the captions “—Purchase
_of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain_
_Assets”. The PIK Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may at any time and from time to time purchase_
PIK Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Tax Redemption**

The PIK Issuer may redeem the PIK Notes of any series, in whole but not in part, at the PIK
Issuer’s discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice
to the holders of such series of the PIK Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date fixed by the PIK Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional
Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the
redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the PIK Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect
thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the PIK Notes, the PIK
Issuer under or with respect to the PIK Notes is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and
the PIK Issuer cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available
(including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction where that would be
reasonable), and the requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or
rulings promulgated thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or
amendment becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax
Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date);
or

(b) any amendment to, or change in, any existing official written interpretation or application
of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including by virtue of a holding,
judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative practice) which amendment or change becomes effective on or after the
Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date
after the Issue Date, such later date)

(each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”).

The PIK Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the PIK Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a
payment in respect of such series of the PIK Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant,
mailing of any notice of redemption of the PIK Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the PIK Issuer will deliver
to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the
prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that
the PIK Issuer is required to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. In
addition, before the PIK Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the PIK Notes as described
above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation
to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and that it is entitled to redeem
such PIK Notes pursuant to their terms.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate
and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions
precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the
PIK Notes.

337


-----

The foregoing provisions shall apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such_
successor Person becomes a party to the PIK Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring
on or after the date on which such successor Person becomes a party to the PIK Indenture.

**Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs at any time, then the PIK Issuer must make
an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of PIK Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal
to €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof) of such holder’s PIK Notes, at a purchase
price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the
“Change of Control Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record
dates that are prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest
payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other
procedures set forth in the PIK Indenture.

Unless the PIK Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the PIK Notes in
accordance with the PIK Indenture, all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived,
within 30 days following any Change of Control, the PIK Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of the
PIK Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the
procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being
made and offering to repurchase PIK Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the notice
will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase
the PIK Notes on the date specified in the notice;

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction
or transactions that constitute a Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which
will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements
under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations;

(d) that any PIK Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will
cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change
of Control Purchase Price is not paid;

(e) that any PIK Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a holder of PIK Notes must follow to accept a Change of
Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.

An agent of the PIK Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the
PIK Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of PIK Notes properly tendered the
Change of Control Purchase Price for such PIK Notes. The Trustee (or the authenticating agent
appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each
holder a new PIK Note or PIK Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of PIK Notes
surrendered, if any, to the holder of PIK Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated PIK Notes;
provided that each new PIK Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1
in excess thereof. The PIK Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or
as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

338


-----

The ability of the PIK Issuer to repurchase PIK Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a
Change of Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the PIK Indenture.
The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the terms of the PIK Issuer’s future indebtedness and the
future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require the Senior Secured Notes or such indebtedness
to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the PIK Notes
of their right to require a repurchase of the PIK Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default
under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial
effect on the PIK Issuer of such repurchase.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the PIK Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will
have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the PIK Notes that
might be delivered by holders of the PIK Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. The
terms of the existing indebtedness of the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries (including the Senior Secured Notes
and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and future indebtedness of such subsidiaries may
prevent such subsidiaries from paying dividends or making other payments or distributions to the PIK
Issuer to enable it to pay such Change of Control Purchase Price. If the PIK Issuer fails to make or
consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such
failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the PIK Notes
the rights described under “—Events of Default”.

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the PIK
Issuer and its subsidiaries may prohibit the prepayment of the PIK Notes prior to their scheduled
maturity. If the PIK Issuer was so prohibited from conducting a Change of Control Offer and not able to
prepay any indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the PIK Issuer
would be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations to holders of the PIK Notes who exercise their right
to have their PIK Notes repurchased following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default or
Event of Default under the PIK Indenture. A Default or Event of Default under the PIK Indenture, unless
waived by holders of the PIK Notes, could result in a cross-default under certain of the financing
arrangements described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

The Change of Control purchase feature of the PIK Notes may in certain circumstances make
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the PIK Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the PIK
Issuer and the initial purchasers of the PIK Notes. The PIK Issuer has no present intention to engage
in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the PIK Issuer could decide
to do so in the future. Subject to limitations discussed below, the PIK Issuer could, in the future, enter
into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not
constitute a Change of Control under the PIK Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the PIK Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on the PIK Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Debt are contained in the covenants described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Limitation on Liens”. Such restrictions
can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the PIK Notes
then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers”). Except for
the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the provisions of the PIK Indenture will not require
the PIK Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions,
or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that
may adversely affect holders of the PIK Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a
Change of Control.

The PIK Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the PIK Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the PIK
Issuer and purchases all PIK Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control
Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the PIK Indenture as described above

339


-----

under the caption “—Optional Redemption” or “—Special Mandatory Redemption—IPO Event”, unless
and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control
provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the PIK Indenture
are applicable. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of
the PIK Indenture, including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of
Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The PIK Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in
connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of the PIK Indenture, the PIK Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the PIK
Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding PIK Notes of
any series validly tender and do not withdraw such PIK Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the PIK
Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the PIK Issuer as described above,
purchases all of the PIK Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the
PIK Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’
prior notice (provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer described above), to redeem all PIK Notes of such series that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the Change of Control
Purchase Price plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Purchase Price, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of the date of redemption.

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) the PIK Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any
“person” or “group” of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and
14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more
Permitted Holders, being or becoming the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3
and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly,
of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the PIK Issuer (or any
successor entity permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”); provided that, for the_
purposes of this clause, no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of
the PIK Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent;

(b) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than
by way of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or
a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the PIK Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person, other than or one or more
Permitted Holders; or

(c) the PIK Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or dissolution
other than in a transaction that complies with the provisions described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.”

340


-----

The provisions under the PIK Indenture relating to the PIK Issuer’s obligation to make an offer
to repurchase the PIK Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the PIK Notes if made prior to the occurrence
of the Change of Control.

If and for so long as the PIK Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the PIK Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of
Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all the PIK Notes of a series are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the
Registrar will select the PIK Notes of such series for redemption by a method that complies with the
requirements, as certified to the Trustee and the Registrar by the PIK Issuer, of the principal securities
exchange, if any, on which the PIK Notes of such series are listed at such time or, if the PIK Notes of
such series are not listed on a securities exchange, _pro rata, by such method as the Trustee or the_
Registrar in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law;
provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of
a PIK Note not redeemed to less than €100,000. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable
for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

No PIK Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed
by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of
PIK Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of
the PIK Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the PIK Indenture.

If any PIK Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that PIK
Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that PIK Note that is to be redeemed. While the
PIK Notes are held in certificated form, a new PIK Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion of the original PIK Note will be issued in the name of the holder of PIK Notes upon cancellation
of the original PIK Note. PIK Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.
On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on PIK Notes or portions of PIK Notes
redeemed.

For PIK Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for
communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any PIK
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the
Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant PIK Notes shall also be published in a newspaper
having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations, posted on the official website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption, the PIK Issuer
will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of PIK Notes
outstanding.

**Suspension of Certain Covenants when PIK Notes Rated Investment Grade**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the PIK Notes attain an Investment Grade Rating from
both of the Rating Agencies and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under
the PIK Indenture (a “Suspension Event”), beginning on the day of the Suspension Event and continuing
until such time (the “Suspension Period”), if any, at which the PIK Notes cease to have an Investment
Grade Rating from each Rating Agency (the “Reversion Date”) (whereupon the PIK Issuer shall
promptly notify the Trustee in writing that the PIK Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating),
the covenants summarized under the following captions will not apply to the PIK Notes and any related
default provisions of the PIK Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the PIK
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt;”

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;”

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets;”

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;”_

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” (but only clause (c)
_of the first paragraph of such covenant); and_

(8) “—Certain Covenants—Lines of Business”.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms on
and after the Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions
of the PIK Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the Suspension Period, and the
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been
in effect since the Issue Date, except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason
of a Restricted Payment made during the Suspension Period. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred
during the continuance of the Suspension Period will be classified as having been Incurred pursuant to
clause (2)(d) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”. Any
transactions prohibited by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Transactions with Affiliates” entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered_
into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (c) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with
_Affiliates”. Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action_
described in clauses (a) through (d) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”_
that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to
clause (2)(c) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other
_Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period,_
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the PIK Issuer will promptly deliver to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate notifying it of each occurrence hereunder. The Trustee shall have no duty to

342


-----

monitor the ratings of the PIK Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the
PIK Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the PIK Notes achieve an Investment Grade Rating
or upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event or Reversion Date, as applicable.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Holdco Ownership_**

The PIK Indenture will provide that (i) prior to an IPO Event, the PIK Issuer shall beneficially
own, directly or indirectly, at least 85% of each of the total voting power and economic rights attributable
to the Qualified Capital Stock of the Company, and (ii) following an IPO Event, the PIK Issuer shall
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 40% of each of the total voting power and economic rights
attributable to the Qualified Capital Stock of the IPO Entity.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The PIK Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, issue, incur, assume, guarantee or in any manner
become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become responsible for,
contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually or collectively, to “Incur” or, as
appropriate, an “Incurrence”) any Debt (including Acquired Debt); provided, however,
that any Permitted Subsidiary will be permitted to Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt)
if:

(a) on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such
Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a _pro forma basis, the_
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company for the four full
fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements of the PIK
Issuer are available immediately preceding the Incurrence of such Debt, taken
as one period, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and

(b) solely if the PIK Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries shall have made (and not
rescinded) Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (3)(r) of the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and/or
Incurred Debt pursuant to clause 2(s) of this covenant and the sum of the
aggregate amount of such Restricted Payments and the aggregate principal
amount outstanding of such Debt equals at least €15.0 million, on the date of
such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the
application of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio of the PIK Issuer for the four full fiscal quarters for which
internal consolidated financial statements of the PIK Issuer are available
immediately preceding the Incurrence of such Debt, taken as one period, would
have been less than 7.3 to 1.0.

(2) The first paragraph of this covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(a) the Incurrence by any Permitted Subsidiary of Debt under Credit Facilities
(including in respect of letters of credit or banker’s acceptances issued or
created thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding
not to exceed the greater of (i) €110.0 million and (ii) 65.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA of the Company, plus, in the case of any refinancing of any Debt
permitted under this clause (a) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount

343


-----

of fees, accrued and unpaid interest, underwriting discounts, premiums and
other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(b) the Incurrence by the PIK Issuer and any Permitted Subsidiary of Debt
represented by (i) the Senior Secured Notes and any guarantees thereof and
any proceeds loans related thereto, (ii) the PIK Notes issued on the Issue Date
and (iii) Additional PIK Notes issued from time to time in payment of PIK
Interest or Additional Amounts in accordance with the PIK Indenture;

(c) the Incurrence by the PIK Issuer or any Permitted Subsidiary of intercompany
Debt between the PIK Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that (i) any disposition, pledge or
transfer of any such Debt to a Person (other than a disposition, pledge or
transfer to the PIK Issuer or a Permitted Subsidiary) and (ii) any transaction
pursuant to which any Permitted Subsidiary that has Debt owing by the PIK
Issuer or another Permitted Subsidiary ceases to be a Permitted Subsidiary,
will, in each case, be deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt not permitted
by this clause (c);

(d) any Debt of the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt
described in clauses (a) and (b) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue
Date after giving effect to the Transactions on the Issue Date;

(e) (i) guarantees of Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Permitted
Subsidiary by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not Permitted Subsidiary and
guarantees of Debt of a Permitted Subsidiary by a Permitted Subsidiary, in
each case, provided that the Incurrence of the Debt being guaranteed was
permitted by another provision of this covenant; or (ii) without limiting the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Debt arising by reason of
any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Debt of the PIK
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Debt and
Lien is permitted under the terms of the PIK Indenture;

(f) the Incurrence by the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising
from customary agreements providing for guarantees, indemnities or
obligations in respect of earn-outs or other purchase price adjustments or, in
each case, similar obligations, in connection with the acquisition or disposition
of any business or assets or Person or any shares of Capital Stock of a
Subsidiary, other than guarantees or similar credit support given by the PIK
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring
all or any portion of such assets for the purpose of financing such acquisition;

(t) Debt of any Permitted Subsidiary consisting of leases (including Capitalized
Lease Obligations) or other obligations existing on the Issue Date or Incurred
thereafter that would have been treated as operating leases under IAS 17

IFRS 16 (Leases).

(3) Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Debt, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital
Stock in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock
or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Debt due to a
change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Debt for purposes of this
covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated
restriction on the Incurrence of Debt, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal
amount of Debt denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Debt was Incurred, in the
case of term Debt, or, at the option of the PIK Issuer, first committed, in the case of
Debt Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Debt is Incurred
to refinance other Debt denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such refinancing Debt does not
exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Debt being refinanced; (b) the euro
equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Debt outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Debt is subject to a Currency
Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Debt is denominated covering
principal and interest on such Debt, the amount of such Debt, if denominated in euro,
will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency
Agreement and, otherwise, the euro equivalent of such amount plus the euro equivalent
of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such
Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, for
purposes of determining compliance with this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant,
increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies or
currency values will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the PIK Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(4) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “—Limitation on
_Debt” covenant (a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or_
similar instruments, guarantees or Liens or “parallel debt,” in each case supporting Debt
otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included
and (b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in
the “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” covenant will not be treated as Debt.

(5) The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Debt issued with original issue discount, the accreted value
of such Debt and in the case of pay in kind Debt, the amount of such Debt shall
include any interest paid in the form of additional Debt;

(b) the principal amount of the Debt or the liquidation preference thereof, as
applicable, in the case of any other Debt determined in accordance with IFRS;

(c) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the
specified Person, the lesser of:

347


-----

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Debt of the other Person;

(d) in respect of any Redeemable Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, equal to the greater
of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in
either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof; and

(e) for the avoidance of doubt and in accordance with IFRS, the principal amount
of Debt shall be determined net of any unamortized portion of capitalized debt
issuance costs.

(6) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Debt of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such
date (and, if such Debt is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this “—
_Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Restricted Subsidiary shall be in Default of this_
covenant).

(7) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Debt described in clauses (2)(a) through (s) of this covenant or is entitled to be Incurred
pursuant to clause (1) of this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the PIK Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary will, in its sole discretion, be permitted to classify items
of Debt on the date of its Incurrence and will only be required to include the amount
and type of such Debt in one of such clauses or paragraphs, and the PIK Issuer will be
entitled to divide and classify an item of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt
described in clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant, and may change the classification of
an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type of Debt described in this “—
_Limitation on Debt” covenant at any time; provided that all Debt Incurred under the New_
Revolving Credit Facility will be deemed to have been Incurred in reliance on the
exception provided in clause (2)(a) above and may not be reclassified.

(8) Debt permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Debt but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more provisions of this covenant permitting such Debt.

**_Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions_**

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, when calculating the availability under any
basket or ratio under the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant or for the purposes of the definitions of
Permitted Liens or Permitted Collateral Liens, in each case, in connection with a Limited Condition
Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default
shall, at the option of the PIK Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary be the date the definitive
agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be
calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of
proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes
of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes
of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such
baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to
fluctuations in EBITDA of the PIK Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such
baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for

348


-----

purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition and the related transactions are
permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of
such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the PIK Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such
definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered
and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the PIK Indenture
after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

(1) The PIK Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions (each of which is a “Restricted Payment”
and which are collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”):

(whether made in cash, securities or other property) with respect to any of the
PIK Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including, without

involving the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) to the direct or indirect
holders of the PIK Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock

the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) for dividends or distributions
payable solely in Qualified Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer or in Deeply
Subordinated Funding, or (iii) to all holders of Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary on a pro rata basis or on a basis that results in the receipt by the
PIK Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of dividends or distributions of greater
value than the PIK Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary would have received
on such pro rata basis);

(b) purchase, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value
(including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation),
directly or indirectly, any Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer or of any Parent

(other than in exchange for Qualified Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer);

(c) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value any Debt of the PIK Issuer that is Subordinated Debt
(excluding any intercompany Debt between or among the PIK Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary), except (i) a payment of interest or principal at the
Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of
Debt purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case, due within
one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition;

redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Deeply
Subordinated Funding; or

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make
a Restricted Payment (A) that is a Restricted Investment (other than, prior to the

amount); plus

(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value
of property or assets or marketable securities received by the PIK

Qualified Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer or Deeply Subordinated
Funding (including upon the exercise of options, warrants or rights) or
warrants, options or rights to purchase, the shares of the PIK Issuer’s
Qualified Capital Stock or Deeply Subordinated Funding (except, in
each case, for Excluded Contributions or Cash Contributions for

Funding financed, directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the
PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary until and to the extent such

Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer or Deeply Subordinated Funding
financed, directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the PIK
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary until and to the extent such
borrowing is repaid); plus

(iv) (x) in the case of any Investment that is sold, disposed of or otherwise
cancelled, liquidated or repaid, constituting a Restricted Payment made
after the Issue Date, an amount equal to 100% of the aggregate
amount received in cash and the Fair Market Value of property or

be limited to Restricted Investments (other than Indirect Restricted Payments)
and (ii) following the consummation of an IPO Event, the PIK Issuer may make
Restricted Payments (other than the Restricted Payments described in
clause (i) above) provided that the total amount of such Restricted Payments
(other than those described in clause (i) above) made pursuant to this
clause (3)(q) does not exceed the lesser of (x) €22.5 million and (y)
€30.0 million _minus the amount of the Restricted Investments already made_

354


-----

paid, transferred or issued by the PIK Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case

indirectly, enter into or suffer to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without
limitation, the sale, purchase, exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service)
for the benefit of any Affiliate of the PIK Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions
being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of €6.0 million
unless:

(a) such transaction or series of related transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole,

transaction or series of transactions is (i) fair to the PIK Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on terms not less
favorable than could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable
transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person who is not an
Affiliate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this description will not apply to:

(a) any issuance of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,

Liens; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this sentence will cease to apply upon the
completion of an IPO Event with respect to the Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer that is subject to such
IPO Event.

**_Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets_**

(1) The PIK Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate
any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration the PIK Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for
such Asset Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value (such Fair Market Value
to be determined as of the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale)
of the assets sold or Capital Stock issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the PIK Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of (i) cash; (ii) Cash
Equivalents; (iii) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the PIK
Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are
converted by the PIK Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash

extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion; (iv) the
assumption by the purchaser of any liabilities, as recorded on the balance
sheet of the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Debt), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result
of which the PIK Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated
with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;
(v) Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) that is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that

guarantee of such Debt in connection with such Asset Sale; (vi) any Capital
Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (2)(e), (f) or (g) of this
covenant; (vii) consideration consisting of Debt (or the cancellation of Debt) of

Persons who are not the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (viii) any

Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale; provided that the aggregate Fair
Market Value of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, taken together with

358


-----

Consideration received and designated as such pursuant to this clause (viii)
(with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect
to subsequent changes in value), is less than the greater of €22.5 million and
1.4% of Total Assets; or (ix) a combination of the consideration specified in
clauses (i) to (viii).

(2) If the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net
Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, within 365 days after the consummation of such
Asset Sale, may be used or committed in a binding commitment to be used (provided
that such Net Cash Proceeds are actually used within the later of 365 days from the
consummation of the Asset Sale or 180 days from the date of such binding
commitment) at the option of the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) to redeem, repay or purchase PIK Notes (i) pursuant to an offer to all holders
of the PIK Notes at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal
amount of the PIK Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (a “Notes
Offer”) and/or (ii) pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under
“—Optional Redemption”;

(b) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay any Debt of the PIK
Issuer (other than the PIK Notes or Subordinated Debt) that ranks pari passu
with the PIK Notes; _provided that in the event of any such prepayment,_
redemption or repayment, the PIK Issuer will equally and ratably reduce its
obligations under the PIK Notes (i) through open-market purchases, (ii) by
redeeming PIK Notes if the PIK Notes are then redeemable as provided under
“—Optional Redemption” or (iii) by making an offer to all holders to purchase
the PIK Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any;

(c) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay any Debt of a Permitted
Subsidiary;

(d) to acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another
Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital
Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(e) to make a capital expenditure;

(f) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a
Permitted Business; or

(g) any combination of the foregoing.

(3) Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds (including cash or Cash
Equivalents received from the conversion of any securities, notes or other obligations),
the PIK Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner
that is not prohibited by the PIK Indenture.

(4) Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided
in clause (2) of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. The PIK Issuer may

359


-----

also at any time, and the PIK Issuer will within ten Business Days after the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €15 million, make an offer (an “Excess Proceeds
_Offer”) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets the_
maximum principal amount of PIK Notes and Pari Passu Debt, to the extent required
by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the PIK Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt. The offer
price for the PIK Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of such PIK Note (and solely in the case
of Pari Passu Debt, no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value,
as applicable) of such Debt), plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date of purchase and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase,
prepayment or redemption.

(5) To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes and any such Pari
Passu Debt tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds, the PIK Issuer (or applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may
use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase the PIK Notes and
other Pari Passu Debt for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the PIK Indenture.
If the aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be
prepaid or validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the PIK Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt
to be purchased will be purchased, prepaid or redeemed, as applicable, on a pro rata
basis (based upon the principal amount of the PIK Notes and the principal amount or
accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or tendered by each holder).
Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
will be reset to zero. If the aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes to be purchased
exceeds the amount of proceeds received for application to such principal amount, the
Trustee will select the PIK Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner
described under “—Selection and Notice”), based on the amounts tendered.

(6) If the PIK Issuer is obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the PIK Issuer will
purchase the PIK Notes and Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in
whole or in part in integral multiples of €1, on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and
not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given
to such holders, or such later date as may be required under the Exchange Act;
provided that no PIK Note of less than €100,000 remains outstanding thereafter.

(7) The PIK Issuer will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent
those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of PIK
Notes pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the PIK
Indenture, the PIK Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under the Asset
Sale provisions of the PIK Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The PIK Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or
otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the PIK Issuer or any other Restricted
Subsidiary;

provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the PIK Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt Incurred by the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

Indenture), the PIK Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,

replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that such
encumbrances or restrictions taken as a whole, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the PIK Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary are not materially less favorable to the
holders of the PIK Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the PIK Notes, the PIK
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) is
customary in comparable financings and, in the case of this subclause (ii), the
PIK Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary determines at the time such
Debt is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely
affect, in any material respect, the PIK Issuers’ ability to make principal or
interest payments on the PIK Notes (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors, the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or treasurer of the
PIK Issuer);

(c) any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, restatements,
modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those
contained in those agreements on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the PIK
Issuer);

361


-----

by the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or

incidental to any IPO Event, including the maintenance of any list of equity issued by
any IPO Entity and the carrying out of any activities or transactions relating to or
consequential from any IPO Event;

(10) any liabilities or obligations in connection with any employee or participation scheme,
including any management equity plan, incentive plan or other similar scheme operated
by, for the benefit of, on behalf of or in respect of itself or any Restricted Subsidiary
(and/or any current or past employees, directors or members of management thereof
and any related corporate entity established for such purpose);

(11) pursuant to or in connection with the Transactions; or

(12) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are ancillary or de minimis in
nature.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the PIK Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the PIK Issuer to be
an Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary or a Person
becoming a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction, or
Investment therein but excluding the Company) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or
be continuing at the time of or immediately after giving effect to such designation and such Subsidiary
to be so designated or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold
any Lien on any property of, the PIK Issuer or any other Subsidiary of the PIK Issuer that is not a
Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise an Unrestricted Subsidiary. If a Restricted
Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all
outstanding Investments owned by the PIK Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of
the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant
described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses
of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the PIK Issuer. That designation will only
be permitted if the Investment of the PIK Issuer in such Subsidiary would be permitted at that time under
the covenant “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”. The Board of Directors of the PIK Issuer may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not
cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the PIK Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving
effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments”._

The Board of Directors of the PIK Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary
to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Debt by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Debt is permitted under the covenant described under the
caption “—Limitation on Debt,” calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at

364


-----

the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in
existence following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the PIK Issuer
as a Restricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors of the PIK Issuer giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions.

**_Provision of Information_**

So long as the PIK Notes are outstanding, the PIK Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

and (iv) material recent developments and any material changes to the risk factors
disclosed in the most recent annual report; and

365


-----

(c) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition, restructuring or
business consolidation or combination of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer changes at the Company or change
in auditors of the Company or any other material event that the Company announces
publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

In the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the PIK Issuer, the Company or
any other IPO Entity are listed on a Recognized Stock Exchange and the PIK Issuer, the Company or
such other IPO Entity, as applicable, is subject to the disclosure standards and reporting requirements
applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such Recognized Stock Exchange, for
so long as it elects, the PIK Issuer will deliver to the Trustee such annual reports, semi-annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the PIK Issuer, the Company or such other IPO Entity is,
or would be, required to file with such Recognized Stock Exchange; provided that, if such reports,
information or documents are not in English, the PIK Issuer shall also simultaneously provide English
translations thereof. Upon complying with the requirements set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, and provided that (i) such requirements require the PIK Issuer, the Company or such other
IPO Entity to prepare and file annual and semi-annual reports and (ii) the PIK Issuer, the Company or
such other IPO Entity additionally provides (x) the information required in the next succeeding
paragraph and (y) within 60 days following the end of the first and third quarters in each fiscal year of
the PIK Issuer, the Company or such other IPO Entity, quarterly consolidated revenues, EBITDA and
net debt of the PIK Issuer, the Company or such other IPO Entity, as applicable, the PIK Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) above.

To the extent that material differences exist between the results of operations or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries (on the one hand) and the PIK Issuer and its Subsidiaries
(on the other hand), the annual and quarterly reports delivered pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above
shall be accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences
between the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (on the one hand) and the
information relating to the PIK Issuer and its Subsidiaries (on the other hand).

All historical financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS on a consistent
basis for the periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial
statements for the Company or any Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the
results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering
Memorandum and in no event (i) shall U.S. GAAP information or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP be
required nor (ii) shall such report include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the
Company.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the PIK Issuer
will also (i) file a press release with the appropriate internationally recognized wire services (including,
without limitation, through the newswire service of Bloomberg, or if Bloomberg does not then operate,
any similar agency) in connection with such report or (ii) post each such report on such website as may
be then maintained by the Company.

So long as any of the PIK Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
PIK Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, the PIK Issuer will make available to any prospective
purchaser of PIK Notes or beneficial owner of PIK Notes in connection with any sale thereof the
information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first
paragraph of this “—Provision of Information” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation,
either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and

366


-----

results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the PIK Issuer or the Company becomes subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or either elects to comply with such
provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the Commission
or (ii) the PIK Issuer or the Company elects to provide reports which, if filed with the Commission, would
satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the PIK Issuer or the Company, as applicable) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as
it elects, the PIK Issuer or the Company, as applicable, will make available such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the PIK Issuer or the Company, as applicable, is, or
would be, required to file with the Commission pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying
with the foregoing requirement, the PIK Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs of this covenant.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “—Provision
_of Information” covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not_
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the PIK Issuer’s
compliance with any of its covenants under the PIK Indenture.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The PIK Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of related
transactions, consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the PIK Issuer is the
surviving Person) or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
of the properties or assets of the PIK Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one or
more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(a) at the time of, and immediately after giving effect to, any such transaction or series of
transactions, either (i) the PIK Issuer will be the surviving Person or (ii) the Person (if
other than the PIK Issuer) formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger or
to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all
or substantially all the properties and assets of the PIK Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has been made (the “Surviving Entity”):

(x) will be a Person duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union, Switzerland, Canada or any province of
Canada, the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; and

(y) will expressly assume the PIK Issuer’s obligations under the PIK Notes, the
PIK Indenture and the Security Documents pursuant to a supplemental
indenture, accession agreement, security documents and any other relevant
document, in each case, delivered to the Trustee and the Security Agent and
the PIK Issuer will cause the PIK Holdco Security Providers to enter into one
or more pledges of all of the Capital Stock owned by such PIK Holdco Security
Providers in the Surviving Entity securing the obligations of the PIK Issuer
under the PIK Notes (or parallel debt related thereto) to the Security Agent for
the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of PIK Notes (which pledges shall
be on substantially similar terms as the pledge entered into by the PIK Holdco
Security Providers with respect to the Capital Stock of the PIK Issuer on the
Issue Date);

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a _pro_
_forma basis (and treating any obligation of the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary_

367


-----

Incurred in connection with or as a result of such transaction or series of related
transactions as having been Incurred by the PIK Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and
be continuing;

(c) the Company would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto
and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable four-quarter period (i) be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional
Debt pursuant to the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in
clause (1)(a) of the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant or (ii) have a Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(d) the PIK Issuer or the Surviving Entity will have delivered to the Trustee, in form
satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease
or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such
transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this covenant and that the
supplemental indenture and the PIK Notes constitute the PIK Issuer’s or Surviving
Entity’s legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their terms
provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s
Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clause (b) and
(c) above.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (b) of the first paragraph of this
“Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which
constitute an Asset Sale if the PIK Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Sale of Certain Assets” or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the PIK_
Issuer.

The Surviving Entity will succeed to, be substituted for and may exercise every right and power
of the PIK Issuer under the PIK Notes, the PIK Indenture and the Security Documents.

Notwithstanding clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this “Consolidation, Merger and
_Sale of Assets” covenant (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), any_
Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to the PIK Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary. In addition, clause (c) of the first
paragraph of this “Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to any sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the PIK Issuer with or
into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the PIK Issuer in another jurisdiction for tax
reasons.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The PIK Issuer will not, and the PIK Issuer will not cause or permit the PIK Holdco Security
Providers to, take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which would have the result of
materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the
incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens and the
release of the Liens created by the Issuer Share Pledge in connection with an IPO Event shall under

368


-----

no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for
the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the PIK Notes, and the PIK Issuer will not, and the PIK
Issuer will not cause or permit the PIK Holdco Security Providers to, grant to any Person other than the
Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the PIK Notes and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral;
provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in
accordance with any other provision of the PIK Indenture (including without limitation, in connection with
an IPO Event) or the Security Documents and (b) the PIK Issuer and the PIK Holdco Security Providers
may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and provided further, however, that, except with respect to clause
(a) and clause (b) of the foregoing proviso (provided that, in the case of such clause (b), unless no
release of the relevant Lien securing the PIK Notes is required in order for PIK Holdco Security Provider
to incur a Permitted Collateral Lien, such Lien securing the PIK Notes is retaken immediately following
its release in connection with such incurrence), no Security Document may be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced or a Lien over the Collateral
released and immediately retaken unless, contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the PIK
Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent any of (1) a solvency opinion from an
internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Security Agent confirming the solvency of the PIK Issuer and its Subsidiaries or the
relevant PIK Holdco Security Provider and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or
release and retaking, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors or the chief financial officer of the PIK
Issuer or the relevant PIK Holdco Security Provider which confirms the solvency of the PIK Issuer or
such PIK Holdco Security Provider, as applicable, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release and retaking and
replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee (subject
to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement
or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the PIK Notes created under the Security Documents
so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken
are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity (if legally applicable) or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification,
replacement or release and retaking.

At the written direction of the PIK Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the PIK Notes,
the Trustee and the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for
Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) evidence the succession of another Person to
the PIK Issuer or the PIK Holdco Security Providers and the assumption by such successor of the
obligations under the PIK Indenture, the PIK Notes and the Security Documents, in each case, in
accordance with “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;”; (v) provide for the
release of property and assets constituting Collateral from the Lien of the Security Documents in
accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the PIK Indenture; (vi) conform the Security
Documents to this “Description of the PIK Notes;” (vii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the
appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent; (viii) provide for Additional PIK Notes to also
benefit from the Collateral or (x) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights
of the holders of the PIK Notes in any material respect.

In the event that the PIK Issuer complies with this covenant, the Security Agent and the PIK
Issuer and the Trustee (subject to customary protections and indemnifications), if required, shall take
all action necessary to effect such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification, replacement or release and retaking.

**_Limitations Related to the BH Cash Management Agreement_**

In the event that (i) BH shall have breached its obligations under the BH Cash Management
Agreement, (ii) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Security Agent shall
have commenced enforcement proceedings under the PIK Indenture (or the security agent under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall have commenced enforcement proceedings under such PIK
Indenture), (iii) the BH Cash Management Agreement or the BH Account Pledge shall have been
terminated, (iv) the BH Account Pledge shall have ceased to constitute a valid and perfected Lien or
shall have been declared legally invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or
(v) Mr. Olivier Bertrand or any of his Related Parties shall have ceased to own more than 50% of the
total voting power of the Voting Stock of BH, the PIK Issuer shall, promptly upon the occurrence of any
such event described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), cause BH to pay over to the Company or the PIK
Issuer (A) all cash and any other property and assets theretofor advanced by the Company to BH under
the terms of the BH Cash Management Agreement (and not theretofore reimbursed), (B) all securities
and cash equivalents purchased with any such cash, property and assets (and not theretofor paid out
to the Company) and (C) all proceeds of the foregoing not theretofor paid out to the Company and shall
cancel and terminate the BH Cash Management Agreement and ensure that no further funds are
advanced to BH thereunder or under any other cash management arrangements whether now or
hereafter in effect.

In addition, the PIK Issuer will not amend, modify, supplement, restate or replace, or cause or
suffer to be amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced, the BH Cash Management
Agreement or the BH Account Pledge in any manner that would be materially adverse to the holders of
PIK Notes.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The PIK Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of
the PIK Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such PIK Notes are outstanding;
provided that if the PIK Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the PIK Notes on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or if at any time the PIK Issuer determines that it will not maintain such
listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such PIK Notes
on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The PIK Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of PIK Notes for
or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the PIK
Indenture or the PIK Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of
the PIK Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation
documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the PIK Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an
inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the PIK Indenture
or the PIK Notes, to exclude holders of PIK Notes in any jurisdiction where (a) the solicitation of such
consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (b) the
payment of the consideration therefor would require the PIK Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws
(including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European
Union or its member states), and the PIK Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith)
(x) such filing would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially
burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar
documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such
jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such
jurisdiction.

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional
Amounts on any PIK Note;

(b) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise)
of the principal of or premium, if any, on any PIK Note;

(c) failure by the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written
notice to the PIK Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in

than a default in performance, or breach, or a covenant or agreement which is
specifically dealt with in clauses (a) or (b) above) or the PIK Notes or the
Security Documents;

(d) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing Debt by the
PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt owed to the PIK Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary) if that default (x) results in the acceleration of the
payment of such Debt or (y) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Debt
at the Stated Maturity thereof after giving effect to any applicable grace
periods, and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or the
maturity of such Debt has not been extended (a “Payment Default”), and in
either case the aggregate principal amount of such Debt unpaid or accelerated
exceeds €22.5 million;

(e) [Reserved];

(f) failure by the PIK Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or a group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary,
to pay final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal) entered by a
court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of €22.5 million
(exclusive of any amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable
and creditworthy insurance companies), which judgments shall not have been
discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive
days or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order or
decree (by reason of pending appeal, waiver or otherwise) shall not have been
in effect;

(g) (i) the security interests purported to be created under any Security Document
(with respect to Collateral) having a Fair Market Value in excess of
€10.0 million will (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Security Document and the PIK Indenture), at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect and to constitute a valid and perfected Lien with the priority required
by the applicable Security Document or the PIK Indenture for any reason other
than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the PIK Indenture and
discharge of the PIK Indenture or in accordance with the terms of the PIK
Indenture and the Security Documents or (ii) any security interest purported to
be created under any Security Document is declared invalid or unenforceable
or the PIK Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or the PIK Holdco Security
Providers granting Collateral that is the subject of any such Security Interest
asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such

371


-----

Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable, and, in the case of (i), such failure
to be in full force and effect or such assertion has continued uncured for a
period of 15 days; and

(h) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the
PIK Indenture with respect to the PIK Issuer, the PIK Holdco Security
Providers, BH or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that a default under clause (c), (d) or (f) of this paragraph will not constitute_
an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding
PIK Notes notify the PIK Issuer of the Default and, with respect to such clause (c), (d) or (f), the
PIK Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause (c), (d) or (f), as
applicable, after receipt of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (h), the
occurrence of any such bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to BH shall be deemed not
be an Event of Default if (and only for so long as) BH holds no cash or other property and assets
on behalf of the Company pursuant to the terms of the BH Cash Management Agreement.

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (1)(h) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the PIK Notes then outstanding by written notice to the PIK Issuer (and to
the Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may, and the Trustee, upon the written
request of such holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and any
Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all the outstanding PIK Notes immediately
due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable in respect
of the PIK Notes will become immediately due and payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clause (1)(h) above occurs and is continuing, then
the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid
interest on all the outstanding PIK Notes shall become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of
PIK Notes.

(4) The PIK Indenture will provide that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding PIK Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf
of the holders of all of the PIK Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences
under the PIK Indenture (except a continuing Default in the payment of interest,
premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on, or the principal of, any PIK Notes held by
a non-consenting holder, which may only be waived with the consent of holders of the
PIK Notes holding 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes outstanding
under the PIK Indenture) and rescind any acceleration with respect to the PIK Notes
and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction). In the event of any Event of Default specified in
clause (d) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any
resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the PIK Notes) shall
be annulled, waived or rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee
or the holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose: (i) the indebtedness
or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (ii) holders
thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may
be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (iii) the default that is the basis for such Event
of Default has been cured.

(5) At any time after a declaration of acceleration under the PIK Indenture, but before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee,
the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding PIK Notes,

372


-----

by written notice to the PIK Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind such declaration and
its consequences if:

(a) the PIK Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee (or another party
designated by the Trustee for this purpose) a sum sufficient to pay:

(i) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all PIK Notes then
outstanding;

(ii) all unpaid principal of and premium, if any, on any outstanding PIK
Notes that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the PIK Notes;

(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon
overdue interest and overdue principal at the rate borne by the PIK
Notes; and

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the PIK Indenture and
the properly Incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsels;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of,
premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and interest on the PIK Notes
that has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been
cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(6) Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding PIK Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.

(7) In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the PIK Indenture at the request
or direction of any holders of the PIK Notes unless such holders have made written
request and offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of
prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or
Additional Amounts when due, no holder of any of the PIK Notes has any right to
institute any proceedings with respect to the PIK Indenture or any remedy thereunder,
unless:

(a) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
PIK Notes have made written request to, and offered indemnity and/or security
(including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to, the Trustee to institute such
proceeding as trustee under the PIK Notes and the PIK Indenture;

(b) the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after receipt
of such written notice and offer of indemnity and/or security (including by way
of prefunding); and

373


-----

(c) the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions inconsistent
with such written request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding PIK Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit
instituted by a holder of a PIK Note for the enforcement of the payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such PIK
Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such PIK Note.

(8) The PIK Indenture will provide that if a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will deliver to each holder of the PIK Notes notice of the Default or Event of
Default within 30 Business Days of receipt of such notice. Except in the case of a
Default or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional
Amounts or interest on any PIK Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice to the
holders of such PIK Notes if a committee of its trust officers in good faith determines
that withholding the notice is in the interests of the holders of the PIK Notes.

(9) The PIK Issuer is required to furnish to the Trustee annual statements regarding
compliance with the PIK Indenture and as to the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default. The PIK Issuer is also required to notify the Trustee in writing within 30 days
of the occurrence of any Default (unless cured) or Event of Default, specifying the
events giving rise to the occurrence of the Default or Event of Default and stating what
action, if any, it is taking with respect to such Default or Event of Default.

(10) The PIK Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such
Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate
in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Provision of Information” or otherwise to deliver
any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this PIK Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery, prior to accleration in respect of the relevant
breach, of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in
the PIK Indenture.

(11) Prior to taking any action under the PIK Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the
Trustee in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal
fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. The Trustee shall have no obligation
to monitor compliance by the PIK Issuer with the PIK Indenture.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of PIK Indenture**

The PIK Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the
outstanding PIK Notes issued under the PIK Indenture (“Legal Defeasance”) except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding PIK Notes to receive payments in respect of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such PIK Notes (including Additional
Amounts, if any) when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(b) the PIK Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary PIK Notes, register, transfer or
exchange any PIK Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen PIK Notes,

374


-----

maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the PIK Notes and segregate
and hold such payments in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of
the PIK Issuer in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the PIK Indenture.

If the PIK Issuer exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the PIK Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the PIK Notes.

In addition, the PIK Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of
the PIK Issuer released with respect to certain covenants (including, without limitation, its obligation to
make Change of Control Offers and Excess Proceeds Offers) set forth in the PIK Indenture (“Covenant
_Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default_
or an Event of Default with respect to the PIK Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain
events described under “—Events of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect
to the PIK Notes. These events do not include events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to
the PIK Issuer, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The PIK Issuer may exercise
its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the PIK Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with the
Trustee (or such other entity nominated by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit
of the holders of the PIK Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case, in such amounts as will be sufficient,
in the opinion of internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of
independent public accountants taking into account the effect of any hedging
arrangements entered into in connection with such deposit, to pay and discharge the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Amounts, if any) on the
outstanding PIK Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as
the case may be, and the PIK Issuer must (x) specify whether the PIK Notes are being
defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a particular redemption date; and (y) if
applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all the
outstanding PIK Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the PIK Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the PIK Issuer has received from, or there has been
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the Issue Date,
there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of
the outstanding PIK Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income Tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the PIK Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding PIK
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income Tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

375


-----

(d) the PIK Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that
the deposit was not made by the PIK Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of
the PIK Notes over the other creditors of the PIK Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the PIK Issuer or others; and

(e) the PIK Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal
Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The PIK Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all PIK Notes
issued thereunder when:

(a) either:

(i) all the PIK Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than
destroyed, lost or stolen PIK Notes that have been replaced or paid and PIK
Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust or segregated
and held in trust and thereafter repaid to the PIK Issuer or discharged from
such trust as provided for in the PIK Indenture) have been delivered to the
Paying Agent (and notified to the Trustee) for cancellation; or

(ii) all PIK Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to
the Trustee) for cancellation (x) have become due and payable (by reason of
the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise), (y) will become due and
payable within one year or (z) are to be called for redemption within one year
under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the PIK Issuer
and the PIK Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with
the Trustee (or such other entity nominated by the Trustee for this purpose) as
trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of the PIK Notes, cash
in euro, non-callable European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire
Debt on the PIK Notes not delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the
Trustee) for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to
the date of maturity or redemption; and

(b) the PIK Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the PIK Issuer
under the PIK Indenture; and

(c) the PIK Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Paying Agent (copied to the
Trustee) under the PIK Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of
the PIK Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the PIK Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided in the PIK Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the PIK Indenture have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel
may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (a), (b) and (c)).

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the PIK Indenture, the PIK Notes
or the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least

any Additional Amounts or the interest thereon is payable;

payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or
after the redemption date) on or with respect to such holder’s PIK Notes;

(f) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium,
if any, interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on, the PIK Notes (except a rescission of
acceleration of the PIK Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding PIK Notes and a waiver of the Payment Default that
resulted from such acceleration);

(h) make any change to any provision of the PIK Indenture affecting the ranking of the PIK

result in the loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder;

(k) waive a redemption payment with respect to any PIK Note (other than a payment
required by the covenants described above under the captions “Purchase of PIK Notes
_upon a Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain_

(l) modify any of the provisions relating to the waiver of past defaults or relating to the
waiver of certain covenants, except to increase the percentage of outstanding PIK
Notes required for such actions or to provide that certain other provisions of the PIK
Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each PIK
Note affected thereby; or

(m) make any change in the preceding provisions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of the PIK Notes, the PIK
Issuer, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent and the Trustee (as applicable) may modify, amend or
supplement the PIK Indenture, the PIK Notes or any Security Document:

(a) to cure any ambiguity, omission, error, defect or inconsistency;

(b) [Reserved];

(c) to add Restricted Subsidiaries to the relevant agreement or provide for any Restricted
Subsidiary to provide a guarantee of the PIK Notes;

(d) to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens;

(e) to provide for the assumption of the PIK Issuer’s obligations to holders of the PIK Notes
by a Surviving Entity;

Indenture, the Security Documents or the PIK Notes;

(h) [Reserved];

(i) to allow the entry into of additional or supplemental Security Documents or to add

of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(l) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor trustee
and/or security agent under the terms of the PIK Indenture or to otherwise comply with

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an
Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s Certificate on which the Trustee and/or the Security Agent may
solely rely.

The consent of the holders of the PIK Notes is not necessary under the PIK Indenture to
approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the PIK Notes
have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any PIK Notes owned by the PIK Issuer or by any
Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with,
the PIK Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding PIK Notes will
have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any
remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The PIK Indenture will provide that, in
case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its rights and powers vested in it
by the PIK Indenture, to use the degree of care of a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under
no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the PIK Indenture at the request of any holder
of PIK Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way
of prefunding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

379


-----

The PIK Issuer will indemnify the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or expenses incurred
without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the PIK Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange. There can be no guarantee
that the application to list the PIK Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to
be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange will be approved as of the Issue Date or at
any time thereafter, and settlement of the PIK Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. The PIK
Issuer has initially designated Banque Internationale à Luxembourg SA as its listing agent (the “Listing
_Agent”). The address of the Listing Agent is 69 route d’Esch, L-1470 Luxembourg._

**Listing and General Information**

So long as the PIK Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of Luxembourg
Stock Exchange shall so require, copies, current and future, of all of our annual audited consolidated
and unconsolidated financial statements, our unaudited consolidated interim quarterly financial
statements and this Offering Memorandum may be obtained, free of charge, during normal business
hours at the registered office of the PIK Issuer.

Anyone who receives this Offering Memorandum may, following the Issue Date, obtain a copy
of the PIK Indenture, the PIK Notes and the Security Documents without charge by writing to the PIK
Issuer at 59, rue de Tocqueville, 75017 Paris, France.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the PIK Issuer will have
any liability for any obligations of the PIK Issuer, the Security Documents or the PIK Indenture or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each holder, by
accepting a PIK Note, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the PIK Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

**Prescription**

Claims against the PIK Issuer for the payment of principal or premiums, if any, on the PIK Notes
will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the PIK
Issuer for the payment of interest on the PIK Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due
date for payment of interest.

**Governing Law**

The PIK Indenture and the PIK Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York and will provide for the submission of the parties to the jurisdiction of
the courts in the State of New York. The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France.

in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the PIK Indenture or the PIK Notes, as the case may
be, and for actions brought under U.S. Federal or state securities laws brought in any Federal or state
court located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since most of the assets of the PIK Issuer are outside the United States, any judgment obtained
in the United States against the PIK Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, redemption price and any purchase price with respect to
the PIK Notes, may not be collectible within the United States.

period, the ratio of the Consolidated EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of

event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (for the
purpose of this definition, the “Calculation Date”) (but not giving effect to (i) any additional Debt to be
incurred on the Calculation Date as part of the same transaction or series of transactions pursuant to
paragraph (2) under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” (other than with respect to
clause (k) of such covenant) or (ii) the discharge on the date of determination of any Debt to the extent
that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to paragraph (2) under the caption “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”), then the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be_
calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by an Officer or a responsible financial
or accounting officer of the PIK Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary) to such incurrence,
assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Debt,
or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of preferred stock, and the use of the proceeds therefrom,
as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter reference period. In addition,
for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio:

(a) acquisitions of any Person, business or group of assets that constitutes an operating
unit or division of business that have been made by such Person or any of its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, including through mergers,

Subsidiaries (including Persons who become Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such
increase), during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference

and may include anticipated expense and cost reduction and cost saving synergies) as
if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period;

(b) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein)
disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded;

(c) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of
prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded, but only to the extent that the obligations
giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be obligations of such specified Person or
any Restricted Subsidiary which is a Subsidiary of such specified Person following the
Calculation Date;

(d) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to
have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(e) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed
not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period;
and

(f) if any Debt bears a floating rate of interest and such Debt is to be given pro forma effect,
the interest expense on such Debt will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account
any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Debt if such Hedging Obligation has a
remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of 12 months, or, if shorter, at least
equal to the remaining term of such Debt).

Adjusted Net Income and Fixed Charges, calculations will be as determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the PIK Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary.

“Consolidated Net Leverage” means, with respect to a the PIK Issuer, as of any date of
determination, the sum of (A) (x) the aggregate amount of Debt of the PIK Issuer (excluding Hedging

Directors or a member of senior management of the PIK Issuer)) minus (y) the aggregate amount of
cash and Cash Equivalents of the PIK Issuer (other than cash or Cash Equivalents received upon the
incurrence of Debt by the PIK Issuer and not immediately or subsequently applied or used for any
purpose not prohibited by the PIK Indenture) that would be stated on the balance sheet of PIK Issuer
as of such date in accordance with IFRS plus (B) (x) the aggregate amount of Debt of the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into not for speculative purposes
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the
Company)) on a consolidated basis _minus_ (y) the aggregate amount of cash and Cash Equivalents
(other than cash or Cash Equivalents received upon the incurrence of Debt by the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries and not immediately or subsequently applied or used for any purpose not
prohibited by the PIK Indenture) that would be stated on the balance sheet of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries as of such date in accordance with IFRS (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
cash and Cash Equivalents held by BH on behalf of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
pursuant to the BH Cash Management Agreement, but only if and to the extent recorded as cash and
Cash Equivalents on the balance sheet of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of such date

determination, the ratio of (a) the Consolidated Net Leverage of the PIK Issuer on such date to (b) the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which

of (b) only) for the economic interest of the PIK Issuer in the Capital Stock of the Company. In the event
that the PIK Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases,
redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Debt (other than ordinary working capital borrowings)
or issues, repurchases or redeems Redeemable Capital Stock or preferred stock subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and
on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio is made (for the purpose of this definition, the “Calculation Date”) (but not giving effect to (i) any
additional Debt to be Incurred on the date of determination as part of the same transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to paragraph (2) (other than clause (s) of such paragraph) under the caption “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” (other than with respect to clause (k) of such covenant) or (ii)_
the discharge on the date of determination of any Debt to the extent that such discharge results from
the proceeds Incurred pursuant to paragraph (2) under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Debt”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect to such_
Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
discharge of Debt, or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of Redeemable Capital Stock or
preferred stock, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning
of the applicable four-quarter reference period. For purposes of calculating the Consolidated EBITDA
for such period:

(a) acquisitions of any Person, business or group of assets that constitutes an operating
unit or division of a business that have been made by the PIK Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, including through mergers, consolidations, amalgamations or
otherwise, or by any Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries

which are Restricted Subsidiaries (including Persons who become Restricted
Subsidiaries as a result of such increase), during the four-quarter reference period or

will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the PIK Issuer and may include anticipated expense and cost
reduction and cost saving synergies) as if they had occurred on the first day of the
four-quarter reference period;

(b) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in

have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period; and

(d) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed

Investment or acquisition, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto or the amount of
Consolidated EBITDA associated therewith, the pro forma calculation shall be determined in good faith
by a responsible financial or accounting Officer of the PIK Issuer. In determining the amount of Debt
outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma effect will be given to any Incurrence, repayment,

in excess thereof. In the case of the PIK Notes, the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be
issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1.00 in excess thereof. For the
purposes of the International Central Securities Depositories, the denomination of the PIK Notes should
be considered to be €1.00 and Euroclear and Clearstream are not required to monitor or enforce the
minimum denomination/tradeable amount of, e.g., €100,000.

Except as set forth below under “—Definitive Registered Notes”, the Book-Entry Interests will
not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective
book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned
by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may
require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not
have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated
form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holder” of Notes under the SSN Indenture or
the PIK Indenture governing the respective series of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their or its respective nominee), will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for
all purposes under the SSN Indenture or the PIK Indenture governing the respective series of Notes.
As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through
which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the
SSN Indenture or the PIK Indenture, as applicable.

None of the applicable Issuers, the Trustee, the Agents nor any of the Issuers’ respective
agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

413


-----

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the SSN Indenture or the PIK Indenture governing the respective series of
Notes, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form (the “Definitive
**Registered Notes”):**

    - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act
as depositary for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed by the
Issuer within 120 days;

    - if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the applicable
Indenture; or

    - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the applicable Indenture and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the applicable Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuers will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions” unless
that legend is not required by the applicable Indenture or applicable law.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them or it in respect of the Global
Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them or it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable
in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof). The Issuers understand that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if
fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by
lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry
Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuers to the Paying Agent. In
turn, the Paying Agent will make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute
such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. We expect that standing
customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of each of the SSN Indenture and the PIK Indenture governing the respective
series of Notes, the Issuers, the Trustee and the Agents will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owner thereof
for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers,
the Trustee, or the Agents or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability
for:

414


-----

    - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such
payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interest;

    - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interest;

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of,
the Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream
in Euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that they will take any action permitted to
be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers
or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes
for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes
to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
Notes requires the physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell
Notes to persons in states that require the physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the SSN Indenture or the PIK Indenture governing the respective series of Notes.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”.
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions”.

415


-----

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the applicable Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
whom the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Transfer Restrictions” and the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount
of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and
_Exchange” and “Description of the PIK Notes—Transfer and Exchange”, and, if required, only if the_
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the applicable
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable
to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a
Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other
Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such
a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuers provide the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement
system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuers
nor any of the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee or any of the Agents is responsible for those operations
or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to
their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

416


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their
account holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn
act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to
pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite
certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such
person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Global
Exchange Market and listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuers expect
that secondary trading in any Notes will be settled in accordance with rules and operating procedures
of Euroclear, Clearstream and/or the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order
to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream,
as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures,
and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of us, the Trustee or the
Agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional
eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against
payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish
at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts
are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

417


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes
including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale
or redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax effects. This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and
judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which
are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences
relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) who purchases the Notes for cash at their issue price
(generally, with respect to any series of Notes, the first price at which a substantial amount of such
series of Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) and who holds
the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not
address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate
and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below.
There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would
not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the
alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to
special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in
securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S.
dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), U.S. holders that are resident
in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdictions outside the United States, persons holding the
Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities
covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of
any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial
statement.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a
corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any
estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any
trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration
of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds
the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status
of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes,
and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

418

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the**
**tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the**
**application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the**
**application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net**
**investment income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Relating to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_Characterization of the_** **_Senior Secured_** **_Notes_**

Although not free from doubt, the SSN Issuer intends to take the position, to the extent it is
required to do so, that the Senior Secured Notes are not subject to the Treasury Regulations applicable
to “contingent payment debt instruments” as of the issue date. This position is based in part on the SSN
Issuer’s assessment regarding the likelihood, as of the issue date, that the SSN Issuer may be required
to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes in excess of stated interest and principal. The SSN
Issuer’s assessments of the likelihood that additional amounts will have to be paid are made solely for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and do not constitute representations by us regarding the likelihood
that additional amounts will have to be paid.

The SSN Issuer’s determination is binding on a U.S. holder unless the U.S. holder discloses a
contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. The SSN Issuer’s
determination is not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenged this position and
the Senior Secured Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be
required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the Senior Secured
Notes and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange
or redemption of a Senior Secured Note. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the Senior
Secured Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the Treasury Regulations governing
contingent payment debt instruments and the consequences thereof.

**_Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Senior Secured Note (including any additional amounts paid
in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be
includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time such payments
are received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize income
equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt,
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S.
holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income
but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency
received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes, or who otherwise is
required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such
interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize
income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such
year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during
the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the
average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis
U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by
the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or
thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to
translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or
the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of
receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of
Senior Secured Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize

419


-----

foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the
U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and
the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This
exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source
and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount on the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Floating Rate Notes and the Fixed Rate Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In the event that the Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes are issued with
OID, U.S. holders of such Senior Secured Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross
income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of
their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of
such Senior Secured Notes may be required to include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of
cash attributable to such income.

The Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated
principal amount of such series of Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount
equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated
principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event that the Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes are issued with OID, the
amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder of such Notes is the sum of the ‘‘daily portions’’ of
OID with respect to such Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S.
holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any ‘‘accrual period’’
a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Senior Secured Note
may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Senior Secured Note, provided that
each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest
occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect
to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Senior Secured Note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’
at the beginning of such accrual period and its ‘‘yield to maturity,’’ determined on the basis of
compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period,
over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a
Senior Secured Note issued with OID at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue
price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Senior
Secured Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and
interest payments to be made under the Senior Secured Note, produces an amount equal to the issue
price of the Senior Secured Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price
only with respect to the Floating Rate Notes, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by
assuming that the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the
floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Notes as of the issue date.

OID, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign
currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods
described above in the third paragraph under ‘‘—Stated Interest.’’

A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the
disposition of a Senior Secured Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID
previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of
the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment
is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above.
For these purposes, all receipts on a Senior Secured Note other than stated interest will be viewed first,
as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the
earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated
as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as
an adjustment to interest income or expense.

420


-----

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Senior Secured Notes_**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured
Note, a U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount
realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable
as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described
above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note. If a U.S. holder receives
foreign currency on such a sale, exchange,, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured
Note, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated at
the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Senior Secured Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method
taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis
U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent
that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain
or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Senior Secured Note generally will equal the cost of the
Senior Secured Note to the U.S. holder, increased by any OID included in the U.S. holder's income with
respect to such Senior Secured Note. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Senior
Secured Note, the cost of the Senior Secured Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the
Senior Secured Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it
elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Senior Secured
Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Senior Secured Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be
ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference
between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Senior Secured Note in foreign
currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Senior Secured Note in foreign currency
determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Senior Secured Note. The exchange gain or loss
with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID
(which will be treated as discussed above under “—Stated Interest,” or “—Original Issue Discount on
_the Senior Secured Notes,” as applicable) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss_
realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior
Secured Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States
for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss
recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be
U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the
Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition.
In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal
income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in
a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Senior Secured Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Relating to the PIK Notes**

**_Characterization of the_** **_PIK Notes_**

Although not free from doubt, the PIK Issuer intends to take the position, to the extent it is
required to do so, that the PIK Notes are not subject to the Treasury Regulations applicable to

421


-----

“contingent payment debt instruments” as of the issue date. This position is based in part on the PIK
Issuer’s assessment as of the issue date that it is significantly more likely than not that interest on the
PIK Notes will be paid in cash and on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the issue date, that
the PIK Issuer may be required to make payments on the PIK Notes in excess of stated interest and
principal. The PIK Issuer’s assessments of the likelihood of interest being paid in cash and the likelihood
that additional amounts will have to be paid are made solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
do not constitute representations by us regarding the likelihood that interest on the PIK Notes will be
paid in cash or the likelihood that additional amounts will have to be paid.

The PIK Issuer’s determination is binding on a U.S. holder unless the U.S. holder discloses a
contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. The PIK Issuer’s
determination is not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenged this position and
the PIK Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to
accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the PIK Notes and to treat as
ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange or redemption of a
PIK Note. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the PIK Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential
application of the Treasury Regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments and the
consequences thereof.

**_Original Issue Discount on the PIK Notes_**

The PIK Notes will be treated as being issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes
because their “stated redemption price at maturity” will exceed their “issue price” by more than a
statutorily defined de minimis amount. The stated redemption price at maturity of a PIK Note will be
equal to the sum of all payments due on the PIK Note other than “qualified stated interest” (generally,
stated interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually in cash or property (other than debt
instruments of the issuer)). The issue price of a PIK Note will be equal to the first price at which a
substantial amount of such series of PIK Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to bond houses,
brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers.

None of the stated interest on the PIK Notes will constitute qualified stated interest because,
under certain circumstances, the PIK Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to pay interest by issuing
additional PIK Notes rather than by paying cash. As such, U.S. holders will generally be required to
include the stated interest on the PIK Notes as OID. There will be additional OID if and to the extent
that the issue price of the PIK Notes is less than their stated principal amount. A U.S. holder is required
to include any OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an
annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of tax
accounting.

The amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder of a PIK Note will be the sum of the
“daily portions” of OID with respect to the PIK Note for each day during the taxable year or portion
thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such PIK Note (“accrued OID”). A daily portion is determined
by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such
period. The accrual period of a PIK Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of
the PIK Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment
of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that
accrues with respect to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the
product of the PIK Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to
maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of such period). OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between
the amount payable at maturity and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period.
Special rules apply for calculating OID for a short initial accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a
PIK Note at the start of any accrual period is generally equal to its issue price (as defined above),
increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by the amount of any
payment on the PIK Note (other than payments of interest made by issuing additional PIK Notes as

422


-----

described below). The yield to maturity of a PIK Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing
the present value of all payments to be made under the PIK Note, produces an amount equal to the
issue price of the PIK Note.

For purposes of calculating the yield to maturity of the PIK Notes, the PIK Issuer intends to take
the position, to the extent it is required to do so, that the yield to maturity is computed using a payment
schedule in which interest on the PIK Notes is initially assumed to be paid in cash. If, contrary to this
assumption, the PIK Issuer pays interest in any period by issuing additional PIK Notes rather than by
paying cash, then, solely for the purposes of determining the amount of OID on the PIK Notes, the PIK
Notes will be treated as retired and reissued on the date of such payment for an amount equal to their
adjusted issue price, and the yield to maturity of the PIK Notes will be redetermined taking into account
the change in circumstances. Such deemed reissued PIK Notes could be subject to the Treasury
Regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments, which could result in adverse tax
consequences to U.S. holders as discussed above under “—Characterization of the PIK Notes.” Any
payments of interest made by issuing additional PIK Notes rather than by paying cash will not be treated
as payments of interest on the PIK Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, any such
additional PIK Notes will be treated together with the PIK Note on which such additional PIK Notes were
paid as a single PIK Note for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

OID on the PIK Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into
U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar value of accrued OID will be determined by translating such OID at the
average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year. A U.S. holder may
elect, however, to translate accrued OID using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual
period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the rate of exchange on
the last day of the taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the
date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder may translate the accrued OID using the spot rate
of exchange on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to other debt obligations held by the
U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid to the
extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the payment received (determined at
the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the
manner described above. For these purposes, all cash receipts on the PIK Notes will be viewed, first,
as receipts of previously accrued OID, with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods
first, and second, as the receipt of principal. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary
income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S.- source and generally will not be treated as an
adjustment to interest income or expense.

The rules regarding OID are complex. Accordingly, U.S. holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the application of the OID rules, including the consequences to such holders of the
Issuer’s decision to pay interest in cash or additional PIK Notes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of PIK Notes_**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
PIK Note, a U.S. holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the disposition and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the PIK Note. If a U.S. holder
receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a PIK Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. In the case of a PIK Note that is
traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis
U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating such amount at
the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make
the election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations

423


-----

between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S.
source ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a PIK Note will generally equal the cost of such PIK Note
to such U.S. holder, increased by the amount of OID accrued on the PIK Note and reduced by the
amount of any payments received on the PIK Notes (including payments of interest in cash, but
excluding payments of interest made by issuing additional PIK Notes). Although the matter is not free
from doubt, if the PIK Issuer pays interest by issuing additional PIK Notes rather than by paying cash,
a U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its PIK Note should likely be allocated between its PIK Note and
such additional PIK Notes in proportion to their relative principal amounts. A U.S. holder’s holding period
in any such additional PIK Notes should also likely be identical to its holding period for the PIK Note
with respect to which the additional PIK Notes were received. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to
purchase a PIK Note, the cost of the PIK Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
purchase price on the date of purchase. In the case of a PIK Note that is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder, and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will
determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such PIK Note by translating the amount paid at the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders with respect to the purchase and
sale of PIK Notes traded on an established securities market, which is discussed in the two preceding
paragraphs, must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to
year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
PIK Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss
and will generally be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively.
Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates generally will equal the difference between
the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price for the PIK Note, determined on the date such
payment is received or such PIK Note is disposed of, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s
purchase price for the PIK Note, determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired such PIK Note. In
addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note, a
U.S. holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received in respect of accrued
and unpaid OID. Any such exchange gain or loss with respect to OID will be determined as discussed
under “—Original Issue Discount on the PIK Notes”. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note, a U.S. holder will realize exchange gain or loss
with respect to principal and accrued OID only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the
disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of exchange gain or loss recognized on
the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note will generally be U.S. source
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the PIK Note for
more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the
case of an individual U.S. holder, any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax
rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in
a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a PIK Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a PIK Note.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Relating to the Senior Secured Notes and the**
**PIK Notes**

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Payments of stated interest and OID accrued on a Senior Secured Note and OID accrued on
a PIK Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive
category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal
income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such
holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on
a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax
shelter transactions cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign
currency transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported
to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, the receipt of interest or OID with respect to a Note or a
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency received in respect
of a Note to the extent that any such receipt, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to
determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID, if any) and the proceeds from
sales or other dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. holder may
be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient and, when required,
demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to
backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with
applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund,
provided that the appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. holders who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in
section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject
to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions). U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this
requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes and the significant penalties for noncompliance.

**Certain French tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain of the material French withholding tax considerations
relating to the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes by a holder of the Notes that: (i) is not a
French resident for French tax purposes; (ii) is not a shareholder of the Issuers; (iii) is not related to the
Issuers within the meaning of 39.12 of the French Tax Code; and (iv) does not hold the Notes in

425


-----

connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. This summary is based on the
tax laws and regulations of France, as currently in effect and applied by the French tax authorities, and
all of which are subject to change or to different interpretation. This summary is for general information
only and does not address all of the French tax considerations that may be relevant to specific holders
in light of their particular circumstances. Furthermore, this summary does not address any French estate
or gift tax considerations.

**PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS AS**
**TO FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND**
**DISPOSAL OF THE PIK NOTES IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.**

Article 1649 AC of the French Tax Code imposes on financial institutions within the meaning of
Article 1 of the Decree n°2016-1683 to review and collect information on their clients and investors, in
order to identify their tax residence, as well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign
tax authorities (via the French tax authorities) on an annual basis.

**_Payments of interest and assimilated revenue in respect of the Notes (including those paid upon_**
**_redemption of the Notes)_**

Holders of the Notes who concurrently hold shares of the Issuers may also be impacted by
other rules not described in this section.

Payments of interest and assimilated revenue made by the Issuers with respect to the Notes
will not be subject to withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such
payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (État ou territoire non
_coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”)_
other than those mentioned in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2° of the same code, irrespective of the holder’s
residence for tax purposes or registered headquarters. Pursuant to Article 125 A III of the French Tax
Code, if such payments under the Notes are made in a Non-Cooperative State other than those
mentioned in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2° of the same code, a 75% mandatory withholding tax will be due
(subject to certain exceptions certain of which are set forth below and to the more favorable provisions
of any applicable double tax treaty). The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial
executive order (arrêté), which is updated at least on a yearly basis. The list of Non-Cooperative States
was last updated in February 26, 2021 and currently includes the American Virgin Islands, the American
Samoa, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Seychelles,
Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu. States referred to in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2°, and thus outside of the
scope of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, currently are Dominica, Fiji, Guam, the United States
Virgin Islands, Palau, the American Samoa, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago Anguilla, Panama and
Seychelles.

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and other assimilated
revenue on the Notes may not be deductible from the Issuers’ taxable income if they are paid or accrued
to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State as defined in Article 238-0 A of the FTC
or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State, subject
to the exceptions set-out in the following paragraph (the “Deductibility Exclusion”).

Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and assimilated revenue may be
recharacterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in
which case such non-deductible interest and assimilated revenue may be subject to the withholding tax
set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code at a rate of (i) 75% in case of payment made
outside France on an account opened in a financial institution located in a Non-Cooperative State other
than those mentioned in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2° of the French Tax Code, or, (ii) to the extent that such
payment is not paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located in such a NonCooperative State, (A) 12.8% for payments benefitting individuals who are not French tax residents or
(B) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of

426


-----

Article 219-I of the French Tax Code, 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and
25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022 for payments benefitting to legal persons who
are not French tax residents, subject in each case to the more favorable provisions of any applicable
tax treaty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A-III
of the French Tax Code nor the Deductibility Exclusion, and the related withholding tax set out under
Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a result of the Deductibility Exclusion,
will apply in respect of a particular issue of notes, if the Issuers can prove that, (i) in respect of the
Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax
Code that may be levied as a result of the Deductibility Exclusion, the relevant interest and assimilated
revenue relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, and (ii) the
main purpose and effect of such transactions were not to enable payments of interest or assimilated
revenue to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

In addition, pursuant to the _Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (French_
administrative guidelines) referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20 dated 24/02/2021 No290 n°290, and
BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30 dated 24/02/2021 No150 (the “Administrative Guidelines”), an issue of notes
will benefit from the Exception without the debtor having to provide any proof of the main purpose and
effect of such issue of notes, and accordingly will be able to benefit from the Exception (the “Safe
**Harbor”), if such notes are:**

(1) offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the _Code_
_monétaire et financier (“French Monetary and Financial Code”) or pursuant to an_
equivalent offer in a State other than a Non-Cooperative State. For this purpose, an
“equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer
document by /or with a foreign securities market authority; or

(2) admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities
trading system provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative
State, and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an
investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further
that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a
Non-Cooperative State; or

(3) admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a
securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of
Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar
foreign depositaries or operators, _provided that such depositary or operator is not_
located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Notes issued under this Offering Memorandum qualify as debt securities under French
commercial law. Considering that: (i) as of the date of their admission to trading, the Notes will be
admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in Luxembourg which does not qualify as a
Non-Cooperative State, and that such market is operated by a market operator which is not located in
a Non-Cooperative State and/or (ii) the Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the
operations of Euroclear and Clearstream, both securities clearing and delivery and payments systems
operators within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which are
not located in a Non Cooperative State, payments of interest and assimilated revenue in respect of the
notes made by or on behalf of the Issuers to the holders of the Notes will fall under the Exception.

Accordingly, such payments made by or on behalf of the Issuers to the holders of the Notes will
be exempt from the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code.

427


-----

Moreover, under the same conditions and to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated
revenue are considered as relating to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated
amount, interest and assimilated revenue in respect of the Notes paid by or on behalf of the Issuers to
the holders of the Notes will not be subject, pursuant to the Administrative Guidelines, to the related
non-deductibility rule set forth under Article 238 A of the French Tax Code and, as a result, also not be
subject to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account
of their being paid or accrued to a person domiciled or established in a Non Cooperative State or paid
on an account opened in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State.

**_Sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes_**

A holder of Notes, who is not a resident of France for French tax purposes and who does not
hold its Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in France, will
not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains realized on the sale,
exchange or other disposal of such Notes.

In addition, no stamp or registration fee or duty or similar transfer taxes will be payable in France
in connection with the sale, disposal or redemption of Notes, except in the case of filing with the French
tax authorities on a voluntary basis.

**_Withholding Taxes on Payments Made to Individuals Fiscally Domiciled in France_**

Pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Tax Code, when the paying agent (établissement
_payeur) is established in France and subject to certain exceptions, interest and assimilated revenue_
received by individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France may be subject to a 12.8%
withholding tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which
the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and solidarity levy) are also levied by
way of withholding at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on such interest and assimilated revenue received by
individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France, subject to certain exceptions.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE**
**VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SSN GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL**

_The following is a general discussion of the insolvency laws of several jurisdictions for_
_informational purposes only and does not address all the legal considerations that may be relevant to_
_holders of the Notes._

**_EU Insolvency Regulation_**

The Issuers and the SSN Guarantors are organized under the laws of France, which is a
Member State of the European Union.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European
Union on July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the
European Union on June 5, 2015 and applies to insolvencies which commenced after 26 June 2017
(subject to certain exceptions).

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to
public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the
courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency
proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests
is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even
conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency
proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to
Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international
jurisdiction.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or
“COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on
a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a
rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered
office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office
of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to
rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that
of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and
supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the
previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined
the COMI in similar terms, the courts have considered a number of factors in determining a debtor’s
COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts
most of its business or has its head office and the location where most of the debtor’s creditors are
established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined
to decide which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of
the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which
it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A
to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the
EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark),
although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

429


-----

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an
“establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in
the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An
“establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried
out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets”.

When main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has
its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has
an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such secondary
proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member
State. When main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been
commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings
may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either
(a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is
situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at
the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an
establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial
proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the
law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject
to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court
that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Furthermore, pursuant to
Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which
insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any
action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as
avoidance actions.

The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU
Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible
or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets
as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of
another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

(i) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from
the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a
mortgage;

(ii) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in
respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

(iii) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having
possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

(iv) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long
as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to
commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers
conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets
of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency

430


-----

proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have
been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other
Member State where the debtor has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the
main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings
in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the
Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those
assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and
priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were
opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to
approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of
such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court
is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that
the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of
individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a
debtor and its creditors, the court, at the request of the debtor or of the insolvency practitioner in the
main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period
not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of
local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary
insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt
of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to
three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. When the court stays the
process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

(i) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main
insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to
facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings
concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and
(ii) insolvency practitioners and courts;

(ii) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure
the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies
forming part of the same group;

(iii) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency
proceedings; and

(iv) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the
interconnection of such insolvency registers.

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 at 11.00 p.m. (i.e.,
exit day) and therefore is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the European Union
_(Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU_

431


-----

regulation as it had effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts
directly applicable EU law (which includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into
UK domestic law. However, while direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of
the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments.
The _Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) set out a number of_
amendments to be made to the Insolvency Regulation, as it will apply in the United Kingdom after the
end of the transition period. On December 30, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom
formally signed the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement provisionally applies as
from January 1, 2021. There remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty
throughout the region and the extent to which “Brexit” could adversely affect business activity, restrict
the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability
and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these
developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the United Kingdom, the
Eurozone or the EU. Further, the _EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a_
replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice
versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office
holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and
to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private
international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel
proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the appointment of a UK office
holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much
less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.

**_EU Directive on Preventive Restructuring Frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and
amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU **Restructuring**
**Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.**

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs
(i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum
standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of
debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to
address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented
and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for
a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors
must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into
separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of
secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be
restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount
of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected
parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the
plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the
protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption
of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect
new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing
granted in the context of a restructuring.

432


-----

In order to transpose the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, the French government
issued:

(i) on September 15, 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as
from October 1, 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and
insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and

(ii) on September 23, 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the
implementation of the 2021 Ordinance.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by
French law, as amended by the 2021 Ordinance and the 2021 Decree, for informational purposes only
and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office
of any member of the Group (such as the Issuers or the SSN Guarantors) or its main center of interests
within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code is deemed to be in France, it
could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., _mandat ad hoc or_
_conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation). In_
addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France or it has an establishment in France
or, (ii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office or its main
center of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed
to be in France, it could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors,
i.e., either safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde and
_sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement_ _judiciaire) or judicial_
liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial
reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the
EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our Group having its COMI in France could be subject to
French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any
company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State
(other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning
of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation also lists accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings as insolvency proceedings but accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings no longer have a separate existence under French law as they have been merged into
accelerated safeguard proceedings as of October 1, 2021 (save for proceedings commenced before
this date) by the 2021 Ordinance.

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or court-administered proceedings with respect to
debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control)
(x) 20 million euros in net turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in net turnover, (ii)
commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from
the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation
does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such
specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with
respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group
(subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance

433


-----

with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds). Accordingly, a court can supervise the
insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in
respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection
of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the
Notes and/or the SSN Guarantees granted by the SSN Guarantors and corresponding security
interests.

**_Temporary measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain temporary measures were enacted by the French
Government to adapt French restructuring and insolvency laws to the health crisis (ordinance no. 2020341 dated March 27, 2020, ordinance no. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, in force as from May 22, 2020
(the “Main Covid Ordinance”), ordinance no. 2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020, in force as from
November 27, 2020 and law no. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 9,
2020). Article 124 of law no. 2020-1525 extended until December 31, 2021 some measures that were
initially adopted by the Main Covid Ordinance that were due to expire on December 31, 2020.

The 2021 Ordinance transposed some of those measures into the French Commercial Code.
These measures, that are therefore no longer temporary, relate mainly to:

(i) the adaptation of the provisions governing grace periods in the context of conciliation
proceedings (see sections “Court-Assisted Proceedings” and “Grace Periods” below);

(ii) the loosening of the conditions for eligibility to accelerated safeguard proceedings (see
section “Court-Administered Proceedings - _Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings”_
below); and

(iii) the priority of payment of certain new financing providers in the context of accelerated
safeguard proceedings, safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization proceedings
(see section “Court-Administered Proceedings - Safeguard” below).

However, some measures have neither been transposed nor terminated by the 2021 Ordinance
and should therefore remain in force only until December 31, 2021 (exactly how this continued
enforceability post the entry into force of the 2021 Ordinance will be interpreted by practitioners and
courts is uncertain). They relate mainly to:

(i) the extension, at the request of the conciliator, of the duration of conciliation
proceedings one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court,
up to a maximum of ten months (see section “Court-Assisted Proceedings” below);

(ii) the debtor’s right to request certain relief from the President of the commercial court if
a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay
payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings (see section “Court_Assisted Proceedings” below);_

(iii) the supervisory judge’s right, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the
creditors’ representative, to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement
proposal the deadline during which creditors are required to respond to a debt
settlement proposal in the context of a standard consultation for the approval of a

434


-----

safeguard or reorganization plan (see sections “Court-Administered Proceedings _Safeguard” and “Court-Administered Proceedings – Judicial Reorganization or Judicial_
_Liquidation” below); and_

(iv) the possibility to extend the duration of a safeguard or reorganization plan up to twelve
years in the context of its amendment (see sections “Court-Administered Proceedings

_- Safeguard” and “Court-Administered Proceedings – Judicial Reorganization or_
_Judicial Liquidation” below)._

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject
to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial
proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the
debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum
period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations that are due and decide that any amounts,
the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than
the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French
government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order
made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures,
and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the
grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement
that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see section
“Court-Assisted Proceedings” below).

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)
when it is unable to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif
_disponible) taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and_
moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date
of the court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the
court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court
order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the
final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation
proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see
section “Hardening Period” below).

**_Court-Assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of
court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement
with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its
indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In_
practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are

435


-----

not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by
law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the _mandataire ad hoc to the statutory_
auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc),
whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court.
The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the _mandataire ad hoc are determined by the_
competent court that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement
between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis:
those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat
_ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred_
from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take
part in the proceedings usually also accept to abstain from such action while they are ongoing. In any
event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5
of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to
the president of the court but is not formally approved by it.

_Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test”
above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by
law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors,
if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name
may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The
proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon
request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of
five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or
acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though
the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the
decision of the president of the court or the court itself.

Pursuant to Article 1 of ordinance no. 2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020 adopted in the
context of the Covid-19 pandemic, until December 31, 2021, at the request of the conciliator, the
duration of conciliation proceedings commenced as from August 24, 2020 may be extended, one or
more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a maximum of ten months.

The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part
of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the
restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will
be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot
be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay
any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to
recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to
do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings.

Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor
retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above) if a creditor has formally
put the debtor on notice to pay, is suing for payment, or does not accept, by the deadline set by the
conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim (suspendre l’exigibilité de sa créance). In the latter
case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the
rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that
had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s
obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge.

Pursuant to the Main Covid Ordinance, until December 31, 2021, if a creditor does not accept,
by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim for the duration of the

436


-----

conciliation proceedings, the debtor may also request from the president of the Commercial Court in
_ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:_

(i) the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for
a payment default;

(ii) the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s
movable or immovable property as well as of any judicial procedure relating to the
distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have already transferred ownership
away from the debtor; or

(iii) the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by
the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement
enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings
remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial
Court at the request of the debtor - following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council
or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened – if:

(i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end
to the debtor’s insolvency;

(ii) the terms of the conciliation agreement ensure the continuation of the business as a
going-concern; and

(iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors.

Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgment (constatation) as described
above and, in addition:

(i) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only
disclose the amount of any Conciliation Lien (see below) and the guarantees and
security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself
should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee
representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may
have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court;

(ii) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods
or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other
than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a
priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims
(subject to certain exceptions including with respect to certain pre-commencement or
post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “Conciliation
**Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization**
proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

(iii) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien may

437


-----

not, without their holders’ consent, be rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or a
reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or
reorganization plan is adopted), not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cramdown (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed);

(iv) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is
communicated to its statutory auditors; and

(v) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of occurrence of the insolvency (see section “Insolvency test”
above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below – see
section “Hardening Period” below), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than
the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case
of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request
of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à
_l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution_ and, while the agreement is in force:

(i) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may
not be compounded;

(ii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor
retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to
impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation
proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally
put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt
with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the
conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the
agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and

(iii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor
and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security
interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the
conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor during the
execution of the conciliation agreement pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French
Commercial Code mentioned above.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the
president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or
approved) for its termination. Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the conciliation
agreement addressing the consequences of such termination. If such termination is granted, grace
periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may also be revoked. Conversely, provided
the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to
obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or
prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically
put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased
by potential recoveries made) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been
consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the
partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (i.e.,
prepack disposal plan) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements,

438


-----

offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may, after consultation of the
public prosecutor, be considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation
of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of
the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a
request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a
_mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of_
the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is
deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an
agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in
and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the
automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be
commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

Although French accelerated safeguard proceedings are the transposition into French law of
preventive restructuring proceedings in the spirit of the EU Restructuring Directive, they are defined in
the French Commercial Code by reference to standard safeguard proceedings.

As a result and for the sake of clarity, standard safeguard proceedings will be presented below
before accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings - Safeguard_**

A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion,
initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not
insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to
attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested
even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings. Following
the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment_
is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the
period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date
on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months.
The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard
plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors (or submit to the classes of
affected parties – see below) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders
do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by
the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms
of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor
(mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission
_d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a_
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings,
alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de
_disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions_
considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g.,
granting security interests or settling disputes).

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de
_cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator,_
the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor,
the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

439


-----

In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert
safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation
period if the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if
the debtor would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation
proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is
manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative
except in the case of (i)(b) above where:

(i) the court may not act upon its own initiative, and

(ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the
court as controller (“Contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the workers’
representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the
debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

_Restructuring Lien: Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard or judicial_
reorganization proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial
Restructuring Lien”):

(i) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business
during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the supervisory
judge and are subject to publicity, or

(ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered
by the court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and
the privilege must be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected
parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan,

enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the
exception of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien (iv)
pre-commencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of
judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the
French wages guarantee scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the
French Labor Code.

The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided
prior to commencement of the proceedings.

In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a
reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan
is adopted) without the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a crossclass cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in
subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings.

Creditors (and if applicable, equity holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the
debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-forequity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary
depending on the size of the business.

440


-----

_Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for_
commencement of the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold
or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have
less than (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover unless,
upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see
below).

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the creditors’
representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt writeoffs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the
creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage.
According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is
possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the
creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for
a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the
length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen
years).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription
to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as
such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan).

Pursuant to the Main Covid Ordinance, until December 31, 2021, the maximum length of a plan
can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses as follows:

(i) this extension results from a decision of the court (a) upon request of the public
prosecutor or of the commissioner appointed to supervise the implementation of the
plan without having to comply with the process that applies to substantial modifications
of the plan (modification substantielle du plan) or (b) taken through the process that
applies to substantial modifications of the plan; and

(ii) the initial payment instalments shall be adapted by the president of the court or the
court to the duration of the plan so extended, without having to comply with the
provisions of Article L. 626-18 of the French Commercial Code (including the obligation
to pay an annual instalment of 5% minimum as from year 3) who may order certain
grace periods pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code within the limit of the
new term of the plan so extended.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as
soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal
(other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’
representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the courtappointed administrator and the controllers.

Pursuant to the Main Covid Ordinance, until December 31, 2021, the abovementioned 30-day
delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’
representative.

441


-----

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan
(plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the
proposals that were submitted to them (subject to exceptions such as the ones applicable to claims
benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten
years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with
maturity dates falling after the term of the plan, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same),
but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s
individual acceptance.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it
deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without
the court’s consent.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the
judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment
must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each
annual instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment
date following the initial maturity of the claim if such date is later than the first payment date provided
for in the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have
received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other
creditors.

The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the
modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the
interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court
clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following
the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate
to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps.

_Class-based consultation: This applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for_
commencement of the proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250
employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or
together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 2333 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of the
supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor
with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties
(parties affectées), as defined below.

Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan.

Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code, affected parties are:

(i) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan;

(ii) equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to
the share capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws,
or their rights are modified by the proposed plan.

The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each
affected party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of
objective verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes representing a sufficient commonality

442


-----

of economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following
conditions:

(i) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests _in rem (sûretés réelles), in_
respect of the portion of their claim so secured, and other creditors shall belong to
different classes;

(ii) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before
commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the
court-appointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party
of its membership in a class;

(iii) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and

(iv) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee
scheme (AGS) claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by
the plan and in respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the
debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such security trust is
taken into account.

The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class
formation and for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights
allowing them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one
communicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from
its chartered certified accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are
calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the
proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account
for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust.

Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the courtappointed administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the
formation of the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding
paragraph, to dispute the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within
ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the
court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or
the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the
parties.

The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debtfor-equity swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the
Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien).

The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to
the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the
court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree.

The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period
may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the courtappointed administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days.

The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the
members casting a vote.

443


-----

If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at
shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds
majority.

Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the
commercial court which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met:

(i) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above;

(ii) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are
treated equally and in proportion to their claim or right;

(iii) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties;

(iv) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors”
test (i.e., no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the
order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event
of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession)) or in the event
of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved);

(v) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not
excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and

(vi) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected.

The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the
debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders
the plan enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted
against the adoption of the plan).

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital
increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a
set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to
the provisions of the plan).

_Cross-class cram-down: The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a_ cross-class cram-down
mechanism into French law: where the safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each
class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator
(with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties that voted against the plan provided
that:

(i) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned
above;

(ii) the plan has been approved by:

(a) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at
least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by
security interests in rem (sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors’
class (créanciers chirographaires); or, if such condition is not met,

444


-----

(b) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an
equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of
the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled
to any payment under the order of priority applicable to a judicial liquidation
(whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan
_de cession));_

(iii) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or
equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest
within the plan (i.e., absolute priority rule);

(iv) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total
amount of its claims or interests;

(v) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not
approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if:

(a) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold
or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250
employees and 20 million euros of net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net
turnover;

(b) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going
concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be
entitled to any payment or retain any interest under the order of priority
applicable to a judicial liquidation (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or
a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession));

(c) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or
by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the
shareholders, pro rata their shareholding; and

(d) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the
dissenting class or classes of equity holders,

The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the
rights of the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The
court may appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of
these changes.

Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s
consent, the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s
objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In
particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption.

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it
can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the
business of the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at
the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the _mandataire judiciaire or the public_

445


-----

prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that
the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would
certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent.

At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party
having voted against the draft plan and considering that

(i) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or

(ii) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation
of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not
been met:

(a) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class
that was not an equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a
payment in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial
liquidation or, in the event of a sale of the debtor’s assets as part of a courtordered disposal plan, were applied;

(b) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan,
such class(es) would not have received a payment or retained an interest in
the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation or, in the
event of a sale of the debtor’s assets as part of a court-ordered disposal plan,
were applied,

may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the
public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of
the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an
expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption
of the plan.

This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to
them, by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor.

In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure
(whether by approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no
statute that allows French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of
10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute
if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed and, in
judicial reorganization proceedings, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see section
“Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”
below)).

_Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations,_
social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under
conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private
economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into
subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors
examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission
_des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards_
indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

446


-----

Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’
claims, the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of
affected parties called upon to vote on the proposed plan.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings - Accelerated Safeguard_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of
accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) enabling it to implement a
restructuring plan in an expedited fashion through a class-based consultation.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following
conditions:

(i) its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux
_comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable);_

(ii) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

(iii) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its
business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough parties that will
be impaired by such plan to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month
period which may be extended up to four months upon request from the debtor and the
court-appointed administrator; and

(iv) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied
for commencement of conciliation proceedings.

The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings
to its financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by
such creditors alone.

If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditors’ classes (see above) to
be formed, the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated
safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions
relating to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same
majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt
cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable
deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the
creditors outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of
affected parties, party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the
statutory auditor or the chartered-accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for
the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make
such a filing (see section “Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial
_Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings” below)._

447


-----

**_Court-Administered Proceedings - Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)
proceedings may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of judicial
liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to
petition for judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming
insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above). _De jure managers_
(including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a
petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the
court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more
appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most
appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation
proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more
appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public
prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into
judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The
court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the
preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any
unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire)
is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period,
which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings),
and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a
draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial
sale of the business), the partial or total disposal of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The
court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission
_d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor_
(mission d’administration).

Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard
proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and
the adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows:

(i) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes
of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the courtappointed administrator on its own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being
requested by the debtor);

(ii) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan
shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days
before the date of the vote;

448


-----

(iii) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure
or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and
void.

(iv) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide
to apply the cross-class cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in
addition to the debtor or the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and

(v) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure
(whether by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cramdown) fails the approval of the plan may occur through the individual consultation rules
(see above).

In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial
reorganization proceedings:

(i) in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level
equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may request the
appointment a court officer (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders meeting
and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by
the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in
favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the
equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization
plan;

(ii) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the
meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least
150 employees, (b) the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious
harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification
of the debtor company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid
harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the
business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator
or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of
the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision
commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to
approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of
the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may
either:

(a) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders
meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having
refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or

(b) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the
reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the
shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly
or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the
voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or
a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings, any
consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right
to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their shares be
purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by
the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties,
be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

449


-----

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the
new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the
duration of the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will
recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can
order the total or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession).

At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or
at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the
liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation
period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a
liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no
observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with
respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to
represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the
liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the
creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the
debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both
of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors:

(i) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed
administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor
during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the
court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a
going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “disposal plan” (plan de cession)), any third
party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all
or part of the debtor’s business.

As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick
assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining
to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the
real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern
market value. The court will tend to favor a credible disposal plan that ensures the
continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the
payment of creditors.

Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a disposal plan on
creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the
payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of
exception:

(a) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to
creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as
collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan;

(b) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial
lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within
the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the
parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and

450


-----

(c) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case
for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not
mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security
interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice
prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless
an agreement is reached with the relevant parties.

Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the
business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the
key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings.
Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their
going-concern market value; or

(ii) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may
decide to:

(a) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or _adjudication amiable_ for real
estate assets only);

(b) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which
spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of
the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the
bidder); or

(c) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private
competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing
without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure
_des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is_
questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court orders a disposal plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems
to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either:

(i) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors
(extinction du passif); or

(ii) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of
assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

(i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate
compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or

(ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by
appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the_
amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation_**
**_proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is determined in the court
judgment commencing the proceedings. Failing this, the date of insolvency is deemed to be the date of
such court judgment. The court may in any case reconsider the same at a later stage and set an earlier
date for the occurrence of insolvency, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of the
court judgment commencing the proceedings. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date
may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important
because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the
insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable
by the court.

Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the
hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the
detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal
consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal
obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that
are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of
cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as
bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security
granted for debts previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an
equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of a professional receivables
(Dailly assignement) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of
insolvency), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the
attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer
of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a
debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or
rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and
notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to
Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due,
transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third
parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening
period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor
was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration
and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant
to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the sixmonth period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions,
which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not
it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”. There is no hardening period prior to
safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**_Creditor Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors
may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of credit facilities granted to the debtor, if the
granting of such credit was wrongful and in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) material interference with the
management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are
disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in

452


-----

respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the
court.

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or_**
**_Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the
acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does
not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing
contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions
_of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor_
_solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the_
French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, no. 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended
to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can
unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not
be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other
parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in
default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual
obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings,
absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of
judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s
obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption
of a disposal plan (plan de cession) as described above. In such case, the acceleration of the obligations
will only occur on the date of the court decision ordering the disposal plan, as described above, or on
the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

(i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one
year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year
(however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded);

(ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially cover the set-off of
related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge
_commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor based_
on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine
_fiduciaire) required by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier_
requesting payment directly from the debtor;

(iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of
the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of
the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the
debtor; security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which
is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge;

(iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred
for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of
services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and
when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the
commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims
secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly
brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the _mandataire_
_judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or_
the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

453


-----

(v) creditors (or beneficiaries of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not initiate
or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the
debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior
to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action
is:

(a) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in
order to file a proof of claim, as described below);

(b) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed to the creditor; or

(c) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such
assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by
way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or_
intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within
the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would
not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in
accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (subject
to secondary proceedings which may be commenced in such Member State).
Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France
and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they
were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located
(unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); and

(vi) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention
right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in
particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities
registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in
particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in
existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held
unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception,
the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result
from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a
master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other
specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and
insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code
and

(vii) in the context of reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only, absent consent
to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to
an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a
safeguard plan or of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court.

In accelerated safeguard, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the
scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the
proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the
commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative
within two months of the publication of the court decision in the official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des

454


-----

_Annonces Civiles et Commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled_
outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged
debts, with respect to which the two-month or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from
their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are,
except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the
proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French
law.

In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of
a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors’ representative under the same
conditions.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator
and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor
has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the
debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor.
Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory
judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the
deadlines described above.

In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its
creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or
chartered certified accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular
process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the
amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four
months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs
of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims
of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court orders a disposal plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the
repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial
liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s
debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit
from a Conciliation Lien or a Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors
and public creditors (i.e., taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only,
certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to
post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority is not relevant to all creditors, for
example creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such
asset will be treated separately.

**_Limitations on SSN Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each SSN Guarantors are subject to:

(i) certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French
Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L.
244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and

455


-----

(ii) French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit
from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare
any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee,
require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were
not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts
guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case
law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the SSN Guarantors and the amounts recoverable
thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes
to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the SSN Issuers to the relevant SSN Guarantor, or any of
its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a
payment is requested to be made by such SSN Guarantor under its SSN Guarantee. Any payment
made by such SSN Guarantor under its SSN Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor
shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such SSN Guarantor
or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this
limitation, a SSN Guarantor’s obligation under the SSN Guarantees could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a SSN Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its SSN Guarantee. The amount secured by any SSN Collateral which is granted by any such
SSN Guarantor (or any other guarantor which is incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the
amount which it is so able to guarantee.

In addition, if a SSN Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return
that is less than the economic benefit such SSN Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into
on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable
arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

**_Rights in the Collateral - Perfection._**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the
security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims
of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of
these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent may have
any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the
securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed
by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers)
in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established
after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by
each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered
in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de
_mouvement de titres) of each Issuer and each SSN Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available_
for security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account,
receivables or bank accounts), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security
interest if it is not publicly registered.

456


-----

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Security Interests_**

Security interests governed by French law may only be enforced by a creditor up to the secured
amount that is due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over
securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally
be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in
a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged
securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the
pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial
foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the
value of the foreclosed securities and related cash proceeds and incomes (fruits et produits). Such
value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually
agreed or court appointed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral
exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash
amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities and related cash proceeds
and incomes (fruits et produits) as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true
regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a
subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities and related cash proceeds and incomes (fruits et produits) is less
than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced
by an amount equal to the value of such securities and related cash proceeds and incomes (fruits et
_produits), and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect._

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in
accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is
possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities
since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by
an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the
methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be direct parties to the
Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured
claim, there will be provided for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent
(the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the SNN Guarantors (as principal
obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (the “Principal
**Obligations”).**

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the
Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the
holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed
by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under
the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security
Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on parallel
debt mechanisms (Cass. com., September 13, 2011, no. 10-25533, “Belvédère”) relating to a bond
documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of
certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting

457


-----

from a parallel debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal
holders of a parallel debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy
_(ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not_
exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the parallel debt mechanism. Although this
court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French
courts of parallel debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure
will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue
addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold
French security interests securing a parallel debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is
scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general
recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt
claim. There is no certainty that the parallel debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability
under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security
Agent as parallel debt creditor under the parallel debt construction are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the Notes may not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks
associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the
Parallel Debt.

**_Trustee_**

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under each of the Indentures that become
particularly important following default or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in
the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

A concept of “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the French
Tax Code and the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) has held, in the _Belvédère_ decision
referred to above in respect of the parallel debt concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust
governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard
proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above,
France has not ratified The Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on
their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

**_Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by_**
**_French courts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second
or lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is
a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the
shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests
which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres
_financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account_
in which the shares of such a company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the
securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a
second or lower ranking pledge thereon. To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly
recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account
and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in
respect of the same tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial

458


-----

securities account, and consequently, no assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking
pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge
over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be
held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the
recovery under the Notes or Note Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event. French
_Ordonnance n°2021-1192 dated 15 September 2021 provides however that the relevant provisions of_
French law will be amended from 1[st] January 2022 to expressely recognize the possibility to grant
successive pledges over the same securities account.

**_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Pledges Over Receivables/Bank_**
**_Accounts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second
or lower ranking pledges over bank accounts or receivables.

The pledges over receivables/bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien
searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over
receivables/bank accounts. As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over
the receivables/bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank
accounts from granting a second ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts, this
structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such
second ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. French _Ordonnance_ n°2021-1192 dated 15
September 2021 provides however that the relevant provisions of French law will be amended from 1[st]
January 2022 to expressely recognize the possibility to grant successive pledges over the same
receivables.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific, “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance
both in and outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a
decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an
agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party
or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters
into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect)
can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan
(commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the
creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced
in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such
legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if:

(i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so,;

(ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor
was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and

(iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the
transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors
(existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act
was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the
counterparty is necessary).

459


-----

If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral,
or the granting of a SSN Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any
defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in
the Collateral or the granting of such SSN Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third
parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant
act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the
Notes, the SSN Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration
that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or
the SSN Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from
subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held
liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuers or the SSN Guarantors as a result
of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as
the Intercreditor Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30 and L. 628-7 of the French Commercial Code
pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, court-appointed
administrator, while constituting the classes shall comply with the provisions of subordination
agreements between creditors that were entered into prior to the commencement of the safeguard,
accelerated safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, provided that such subordination
agreements have been brought to his attention within the required deadline.

As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this offering
memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not
give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be dated as of
October     , 2021, the Issuers have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers
have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuers.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions
by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover
page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes
may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales of the Notes by the Initial
Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are
qualified broker-dealers under applicable law.

We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in
connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who
purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges
in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuers will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial
Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The
Issuers have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the
Issuers that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase
Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement,
without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to persons outside
the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph
have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described
under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted and agreed that it
has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available
any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

    - a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;

    - a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or

    - not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted and agreed that it
has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available

461


-----

any Notes to any retail investor in the UK. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

    - a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;

    - a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

    - not a qualified investor as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation.

In the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have, severally and not jointly, represented,
warranted and agreed that they:

    - have only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or
cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by them in connection with the
issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does
not apply to the Issuers; and

    - have complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by them in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, France and the United
Kingdom, by the Issuers or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the
Issuers or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes
may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or
from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any
such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to purchase the Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be
unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering
Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Important Information About This Offering Memorandum”
and “Notice to Investors”.

The Notes and the SSN Guarantees are a new issue of securities for which there currently is
no market. The Issuers intend to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and to admit the Notes for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof; however, the Issuers cannot assure
you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the Notes
as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in
the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the
Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits
imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuers
cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

462


-----

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about
the date specified on the Issue Date, which will be     business days (as such term is used for
purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the PIK
Notes (this settlement cycle is referred to as “T +      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next      succeeding business days
will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their respective
behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the
purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also
over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the
open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and
purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These
activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that
may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may
end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading
markets for, the Notes.

These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may
begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and,
if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Managers. If
these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date
and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the
over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided, and may in
the future provide, commercial lending, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory
services to the Issuers, the SSN Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have
received, and in the future may receive, customary fees and expenses. In addition, in the ordinary
course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad
array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
Issuers or the Issuers’ affiliates. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with
us and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments
and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and
instruments. Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers will be mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will be made available to the SSN Issuer and certain
of its subsidiaries on or about the Issue Date.

Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are
broker-dealers registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. To the extent
that any Initial Purchaser intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so
through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by FINRA regulations. In addition, until
40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by
a dealer, whether or not participating in the Offering, may violate the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A of the
U.S. Securities Act and in connection with any applicable state securities laws.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other_
_transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the SSN Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, or securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered
or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
Accordingly, the Notes and the SSN Guarantees offered hereby are being offered and sold only to
persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers”, commonly referred to as “QIBs”, (as
defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (and only to
investors who, if in a Member State of the EEA are not retail investors) and if in the UK, are not retail
investors. A “retail investor” in relation to a Member State of the EEA means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation. A “retail investor” in relation to the UK means a person who is one (or more) of
the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions
of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes under the U.S. Securities Act, and
therefore the Notes and the SSN Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United States except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, the Issuers are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers
for re-offer and resale only:

    - in the United States, to QIBs, as defined in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

    - outside the United States, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them
in Regulation S.

You, by your acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and
agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand that the Notes and the SSN Guarantees are being offered for resale in
a transaction not involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning
of the U.S. Securities Act, that the Notes have not been and will not be registered under
the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, including sales pursuant
to Rule 144A and, unless so registered may not be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise
transferred, except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in
any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions
for transfer set forth in paragraphs (6) and (7) below.

(2) You are neither of the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144A), nor acting on its
behalf, and that you are either:

464


-----

(a) a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A, and are aware that any sale of Notes
to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and such acquisition of Notes will
be for your own account or for the account of another person that you
reasonably believes is a QIB; or

(b) purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S;

(c) if you are in a Member State of the EAA, are not a retail investor (as defined
above in relation to the EEA); or

(d) if you are in the UK, are not a retail investor (as defined above in relation to the
UK).

(3) You acknowledge that neither the Issuers nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing the Issuers or the Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to you
with respect to the offer or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in
this Offering Memorandum, such Offering Memorandum having been delivered to you
and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision with respect to the
Notes. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing
the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have had access to such financial
and other information concerning the Issuers and the Notes as you have deemed
necessary in connection with your decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuers and the Initial
Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment,
and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws, subject to any
requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or
their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other
exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are
purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by the acceptance
thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to
the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the case of the Notes
issued in reliance on Rule 144A, one year after the later of the date of the original issue,
the original issue date of any additional Notes and the last date on which the Issuer or
any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereof) or, in the
case of the Notes issued in reliance on Regulation S, 40 days after the later of the
original issue date (or, if later, the issue date of any additional Notes) and the last date
on which the Notes were first offered to persons other than “distributors” (as defined in
Rule 902 of Regulation S), only (i) to the Issuers or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant
to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities
Act, an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or in
any transaction not subject thereto, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for
its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is
being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur
outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S or (v) pursuant to any other
available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act,
subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of

465


-----

your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within
your or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and
any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to our and the Trustee’s
rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer, (A) pursuant to clause (v) above to require
the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory
to each of them and (B) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of
transfer is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing
restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination
Date.

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the
following effect:

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

Each of the Issuers and the SSN Guarantors is an entity organized under the laws of France
with its registered office and principal place of business located in France (together, the “French
**Entities”).**

The majority of the directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither
residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets
of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may
not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce
against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or
state securities laws within the United States. Actions in the United States under the U.S. federal
securities laws could be affected under certain circumstances by (i) the French law No. 68-678 of July
26, 1968, as modified by the French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (relating to communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to
foreign authorities or persons) and by (ii) the French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 (relating to the
protection of business confidentiality) which may both preclude or restrict the obtaining of evidence in
France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action.

**France**

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement
of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or
not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal judiciare) that has exclusive jurisdiction
over such matter. The civil court with territorial jurisdiction is determined in accordance with Articles 42
and 43 of the French Code of Civil Procedure.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained, at the request of the party in
whose favor the judgment was rendered, following proper proceedings (i.e., non ex parte) if the French
civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing
French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

    - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the
dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international
forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did
not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

    - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

    - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only a U.S. judgment that is enforceable
in the jurisdiction of the U.S. court which rendered it can benefit from an exequatur under French law,

471


-----

that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has
become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time
enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S.
judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit
from the _res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be_
declared enforceable in France after all remedies have been exhausted. However, the decision granting
the exequatur is subject to appeal, the appeal Court decision also being rendered on the ground of the
above-mentioned criteria.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be affected
under certain circumstances by (i) French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law
No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic,
commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) and by (ii) the
French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 (relating to the protection of business confidentiality) which
may both prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a
judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have
to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French
procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (Law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing,
data files and individual liberties, as modified by the French law No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 (relating
to the protection of personal data)) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining
information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action
in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign
law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to
govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French
international public policy (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts) or in case of
overriding mandatory rules. Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or
state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of
obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country
with French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued
by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted
by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has
interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not
be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according
to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an
action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute
and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to
benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct
by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters (recast) (the “Brussels I Regulation (Recast)”), the privileges granted
to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against
a person domiciled in a Member State where the legal actions fall within the scope of Brussels I
Regulation (Recast). Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Brussels I Regulation (Recast), the privilege
granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France,
regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the

472


-----

EU. Moreover, three decisions of the civil chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation)
dated September 26, 2012, March 25, 2015 and October 7, 2015 and a decision of the commercial
chamber of the French Supreme Court permit that contractual provisions submitting one party to the
exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party an additional option to choose another
jurisdiction (one-sided jurisdiction clauses) may only be effective if they set out an objective basis for
the alternative jurisdictions that one party could choose. Accordingly, any one-sided jurisdiction clauses
which do not set out an objective basis (as a reference to a ground of jurisdiction or to legal rules) in
any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) confirmed in 2018 its earlier decisions
rendered in 2015 and 2012.

However, these decisions were made on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of
December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters or on the basis of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments
in civil and commercial matters signed in Lugano on October 30, 2007 and that such decisions have
yet to be confirmed in the context of Brussels I Regulation (Recast).

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

#### 1. THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESS

###### Burger King France S.A.S. is a French simplified joint-stock company (SAS) that has its registered office at 34 Rue Mozart, 92110 Clichy. It is registered in the Paris trade register under No. 797 882 867.

 The Burger King France group develops and optimizes a fast-food restaurant concept that is based predominantly on hamburgers and employs various techniques, knowledge and know-how that are appropriate for this type of restaurant. 

 The condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the "interim financial statements") for the six months ended June 30, 2021, present the financial position of Burger King France S.A.S and its subsidiaries (the "Group") and the company's interests in joint ventures. They are presented in euros, with figures rounded off to the nearest thousand.

 The Group's financial year runs from January 1 to December 31. 


-----

#### 2. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF THE PERIOD AND POST-BALANCE
###### SHEET EVENTS

 2.1. Significant events of the period

 The first half of 2021 was marked by the following significant events:

 Covid-19 health crisis

 The health crisis arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, which began to significantly impact the Burger King France Group's business in March 2020, continued throughout the first half of 2021. 

 Burger King Group France had to deal with various restrictive measures, such as a ban on indoor sales until May 19, 2021, the closure of major shopping centers, and national curfews for part of the first half of the year.

 Business was also affected by traffic restrictions that prevented customers from going to our restaurants, the closure of children's play areas, the lack of foreign tourists and the temporary closure of some restaurants in airports and train stations.

 Despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on its restaurants, the Group has ensured that it has sufficient liquidity to cover its short and medium-term obligations, for itself and for each of its subsidiaries. The ability of the Group and its subsidiaries to continue as going concerns is therefore not at risk. 

 It should be noted that on March 14, 2020 the French government ordered the closure of restaurants until at least April 15, 2020. Furthermore, on March 16, 2020 the government announced lockdown measures that required everyone residing in France to remain at home until at least March 31, 2020, except for reasons of absolute necessity. This lockdown period was subsequently extended.

 Given the uncertainty of the health crisis, when the restaurant closures were announced in March 2020, the Group immediately decided to draw down all of its available credit lines, and most significantly the €60 million RCF line (see Note 10.2). 

 The Group also immediately worked with its creditors to obtain a government-guaranteed "PGE" loan for €80 million at the end of the first half of the year (see Note 10.2).

 After securing this loan, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million on the RCF line and thus reduce its use to €20 million (see Note 10.2).

 Business development


-----

###### After opening 21 restaurants in 2020 (including 20 under the Burger King® brand) and converting 9 restaurants previously operated under the Quick® brand to the Burger King® brand, the Group continued to expand in the first half of 2021 with:
 • The opening of 17 new restaurants, including 15 operated under the Burger King® brand
 • The conversion to the Burger King® brand of 15 restaurants formerly operating under the Quick® brand. A significant portion of the investments for this development was assumed by the lessors or supported by the Group's franchisees, thus limiting the Group's remaining net investment.

 System-wide sales

 At June 30, 2021, the Group's system-wide sales for the first half totaled €618 million, of which continuing operations accounted for €517 million (an increase of €168 million year-on-year) and discontinued operations for €101 million (an increase of €26 million year-on-year). The increase in the Group's system-wide sales is mainly attributable to:
 • The Covid-19 health crisis's constraints on restaurant business in the first half of 2020, which resulted in the temporary closure of all restaurants between March 16 and the end of April 2020, and then the gradual reopening of restaurants, subject to restrictive measures, between the end of April and June 30, 2020
 • The resumption of near-normal business activity on May 19, 2021, as the remaining Covid-19 measures were eased during the first months of 2021
 • The opening of 28 new Burger King® restaurants over the 12 months up to June 30, 2021 (of which 15 in H1 2021 and 13 in H2 2020), and
 • The development or expansion of new sales channels (home delivery, click & collect and pick-up parking). However, this increase was partially offset by:
 • The banning of in-restaurant sales until May 19, 2021
 • The extension of the closure of shopping centers from larger than 20,000m² to larger than 10,000m², which required the closure of restaurants in these shopping centers that did not have drive-through access
 • Nation-wide curfews
 • Other restrictive measures, such as a 50% limit on indoor dining as of May 19, 2021, and the closure of our children's areas
 • The lack of tourists
 • Temporary closure of some restaurants in airports and railway stations
 • The permanent closure or sale of five Quick® restaurants.

 2.2. Post-balance sheet events

 On July 30, 2021, Burger King France announced that it had signed an agreement with H.I.G. Capital private- equity funds to sell 107 Quick® restaurants, through the sale of 100% of the share capital of its subsidiary Quick Restaurants S.A. This disposal will strengthen the Group's financial structure and enable it to pursue its development. The approximately €240 million obtained from this disposal will be used to repay all of the €80 million "PGE" government-guaranteed loan granted in June 2020, and to reduce the Group's total net debt.


-----

###### This disposal is expected to close before the end of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of the usual requirements for such a transaction, such as antitrust clearance.

#### 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION

###### 3.1. Declaration of conformity

 The interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" and should be read in conjunction with the Group's latest annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the "latest annual financial statements"). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared under IFRS. However, they include selected notes explaining significant events and transactions that serve to understand changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the most recent annual financial statements. All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-andsupplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adoptinginternational-accounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric

###### These interim financial statements were prepared under the Chair's responsibility as of July 30, 2021.

 3.2. Changes in the accounting framework

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2021

 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2021 are:

 • Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9
 • Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Reform of benchmark interest rates (Phase 2).

 These new standards had no material impact on the Group's interim consolidated financial statements.

 The extension of the IFRS 16 amendment approved by the EU on August 31, 2021 was not taken into account in the June 30, accounts and the Group does not expect this to have a material impact on the December 31, 2021 accounts. 

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2022

 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2022:

 • Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts: Contract performance costs
 • Amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 9, Illustrative Examples of IFRS 16 and IAS 41 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2018 - 2020;
 • Amendments to IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment: Revenue earned before the intended use


-----

###### • Amendments to IFRS 3 – References to the Conceptual Framework

 At the time of this publication, the Group does not expect these new standards to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

 3.3. Use of estimates and judgments

 In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements.

 Management's significant judgments in applying the Group's accounting policies and the main sources of estimation uncertainty are those described in the most recent annual financial statements.

 3.4. Methods used to translate foreign currency transactions

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the operating currency of all Group entities. All amounts are rounded to the nearest one thousand euros, unless otherwise indicated. 

 Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement.

 3.5. Basis of assessment

 The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivatives which are measured at fair value.

#### 4. CONSOLIDATION SCOPE

###### 4.1. Business combinations

 The table below shows the calculation of goodwill from the Group's acquisition of companies.

Groll SAS 01/01/2021 100% 1602  - 603 999

(1) measured pro rata the net identifiable assets.

###### In compliance with the Group's accounting principles this €2 million in goodwill is allocated to the group of CGUs (the Group CGU) which represents the single operating segment.

 The following table shows the cash flows associated with these acquisitions.

_In 000 EUR_ **June 2021**

Cash consideration (1 691)
Cash and cash equivalents of the acquired entities 1 016

**Acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash** **(675)**

###### A total of €(6,653) thousand for "Acquisitions of subsidiaries, net of cash" was recorded in the cash flow statement. The difference of (5,978) thousand euros is explained by: - The purchase of minority interests in Flagship, for (3,272) thousand euros, i.e. 49.29% - The purchase of minority interests in SL2R for (2,746) thousand euros, or 44.92% - The sale of 10% of the shares held in YHVH Restauration, for 61 thousand euros - The adjustment of the purchase price of Dorli Burger shares, for (21) thousand euros.

 In 2020, a cash advance of €1,413 thousand euros was made for the purpose of Groll SAS shares.

 Acquisition expenses are recorded in "Other non-current operating expenses". No significant costs were recognized in 2021. 

 The contribution of these companies to sales and franchise revenues and to the net profit of the year, from their date of acquisition to June 30, 2021, is immaterial.

###### 4.2. Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities held for sale

 In order to focus on the development of the Burger King brand in France, since 2019 the Group has been reorganizing Quick's business activities into a separate group of companies to facilitate their sale. 

 During the first year, the restrictive measures imposed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus prevented the formal launching of the process to sell Quick business activities. However, throughout this period, the Group took the necessary steps to prepare for this sale, which included setting up a dedicated management structure and proceeding with the legal reorganization of the businesses to be sold.

 Given this reorganization and the steps already taken, the Group considered that the sale of this business was highly probable within the next twelve months and met the IFRS 5 classification criteria at the end of 2019 and of 2020. 

 As explained in the subsequent events section (see Note 2.2), efforts to sell the Quick Group were pursued in July 2021 and resulted in a purchase offer on July 29, 2021.

 Given the final administrative formalities to be completed, the disposal of the business is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021, for a price of approximately €240 million, which exceeds the net asset value of the business to be sold (€238.7 million).

4.2.1. **ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE**

###### The group of companies to be sold consists of the following assets and liabilities at June 30, 2020

_In 000 EUR_ June 2021 Dec. 2020

Goodwill 47 584 47 584
Intangible assets 113 045 113 053
Property, plant and equipment 137 997 124 289
Inventories 64 91
Trade and other receivables 14 029 12 058
Cash and cash equivalents 17 491 2 031
Assets held for sale 330 210 299 106

Lease liabilities 64 029 59 903
Trade and other payables 27 484 13 414

Liabilities held for sale 91 513 73 317

###### The above assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value. The increase in property, plant and equipment is attributable to the increase in rights of use resulting from the renewal of some leases in 2021. 


-----

###### The changes in trade and other payables are mainly due to the unwinding of inter-company relationships between the entities to be sold and those that comprise the continuing operations. There is no significant inter-company position between these two sub-groups at June 30, 2021.

4.2.2. **NET INCOME OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

###### The table below shows operating income from discontinued operations, before and after tax.

_In 000 EUR_ June 2021 June 2020

Income tax (1 257) (2 022)
**Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax** **7 719** **4 262**

###### In 2021, the income tax on the discontinued operations is attributable to a tax adjustment under Belgian tax law. 


-----

4.2.3. CASH FLOW FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

###### Cash flows from discontinued operations are as follows: 

_In 000 EUR_ June 2021 June 2020


6 730
(2 082)


Cash generated/(used) by operating activities
Cash generated/(used) by investment activities


22 140

(496)


Cash generated/(used) by financial activities (6 183) (5 647)

Change in cash and cash equivalents 15 462 (999)

###### The significant change in cash between December 2020 and June 2021 is attributable to the decision to make the sub-group of entities to be sold financially independent. For this purpose, one of the restructuring transactions was to provide the Quick entities with sufficient resources to cover their payments to external third parties, and to other Group entities through the direct offsetting of inter-company payables and receivables.

#### 5. SEGMENT INFORMATION

###### The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") is its Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

 The Group's business activity, which constitutes a single operating segment, is the development and operation of restaurants in France under franchise agreements or which it owns. 

 Note 6.1A provides a breakdown of revenue by type of product and service, with a distinction between merchandise revenue by company-owned restaurants and income from franchise agreements.  No individual customer is of significant size.

**Sales and franchise revenues** **221 407** **100%** **137 506** **100%**

6.1.1. **CONSUMER SALES**

###### Sales to consumers in the first half of 2021 totaled €89.7 million, which is €16.9 million more than in the first half of 2020 (€72.8 million).

 This increase is mostly attributable to the Covid crisis and the factors that are responsible for the increase in system-wide sales. System-wide sales are the sales to consumers of the Group-owned restaurants and the restaurants operated by our Burger King and Quick franchise partners. 

 In addition to the above factors, eight restaurants that were previously operated directly by the Group were franchised over the past 12 months. The impact of this was partially offset by the Group's taking over of two restaurants previously operated under a franchise.


-----

6.1.2. **ROYALTIES AND OTHER CHARGES TO FRANCHISEES**

###### At June 30, 2021, there were 337 franchised restaurants, compared to 291 a year earlier.

 Franchisees revenue for the first half of 2021 totaled €92.2 million, vs. €55.1 million in the first half of 2020, for an increase of €37.1 million. This increase over the previous year is mainly attributable to the increase in retail sales, as explained above. In addition to the above: 
 • The transfer to franchisees of eight restaurants the Group operated directly was partially offset by the Group's takeover of two franchised restaurants.
 • The support provided to our franchisees during the Covid-19 crisis in the first half of 2020 – which involved temporary adjustments to royalty payments under formal contract amendments, the suspension of guaranteed minimum royalties during lockdown periods, and variable royalty schedules to facilitate the resumption of normal business activity – had a much greater impact on sales than the support provided in the first half of 2021.

 • The permanent closure or sale of five Quick® restaurants.

###### Sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees totaled 63 thousand euros in the first half of 2021, vs. 1.8 million euros in the first half of 2020. This sharp drop between the two periods is mainly due to the decrease in equipment sales by the Logirest

Other revenue 36 420 6 454

**Total** **39 478** **7 848**

###### "Other revenue" in the first half consisted mainly of revenue from property development contracts (for €32.9 million) with external lessors for the development of the Burger King® restaurant network and the creation of new restaurants, for which revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, and to a lesser extent of sales to franchise partners and other non-Group partners.

 Most of the costs relating to these "Other sales" are included in "Total cost of sales" under "Cost of supplies and merchandise" (see Note 6.2)

 The change in other sales between H1 2021 and H1 2020 is mainly attributable to the number of Burger King® restaurants completed or under construction under property development contracts.

 Deferred income from network and franchise entry fees is included in "Other non-current liabilities" ( see Note 6.7) and in "Other current liabilities" (see Note 6.5.4). It is broken down in the following table:

-----

###### and create new restaurants, which are recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis.

 The sales corresponding to these "Cost of supplies and merchandise" are included in "Sales and franchise income" under "Sales to consumers" (see Note 6.1.1) and "Other sales" (see Note 6.1.4).

 The change in the "Cost of supplies and merchandise" between H1 2021 and H1 2020 is mainly due to the number of Burger King® restaurants completed or under construction under property development contracts (27.4 million euros in H1 2021 vs. 2.2 million euros in H1 2020).

Total other non-current income and expenses (1 544) (3 073)

###### Quick n'King 2020 conversion project

 The expenses presented on this line are mainly restaurant closure and conversion costs.

 • Restaurant closure costs are primarily comprised of the disposal of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of restaurants that are closed or sold. In the first half of 2021, the Group closed one restaurant (vs. one in H1 2020).
 • Conversion expenses consist mainly of the amortization of rights of use recognized during the period of the conversion work, personnel expenses and the cost of scrapping Quick's PPE and intangible assets. In the first half of 2021, the Group converted 15 restaurants (versus 3 in H1 2020).

###### Deferred income consists of the short-term portion of entry fees spread over the term of the franchise agreement. 

6.5.5. **CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL**

###### The change in the working capital requirement breaks down as follows:

_In 000 EUR_ **June 2021** **June 2020**

Effect of change in inventories 315 19
Effect of change in trade receivables and other current assets 7 961 (3 250)
Effect of change in trade payables and other liabilities 1 464 7 762
**Total** **9 740** **4 531**

###### The improvement in the impact of the change in trade receivables of €8.0 million observed over the period is mainly attributable to:

 • Reversals of impairment losses recognized in 2020 following the payment of invoices for March 2020, which was deferred to 2021,
 • The payment of invoices issued to third party lessors in 2020. This change is partially offset by the increase in trade receivables resulting from the recovery of business.

 The deterioration of the positive impact of the change in trade payables and other current liabilities, from €7.8 million at the end of June 2020 to €1.5 million at the end of June 2021, is mainly attributable to the suspension of the payment of some Q2 2020 rents at the end of June 2020 under agreements negotiated with our main lessors during the Covid-19 crisis. The suspended payments were, for the most part, settled during the second half of 2020.

#### 7. PERSONNEL EXPENSES

###### The table below shows personnel expenses recognized in ordinary operating income.

_In 000 EUR_ **June 2021** **June 2020**

Head office staff salaries and social-security charges (12 900) (10 780)
Restaurant staff salaries and social-security charges (28 711) (31 384)
Training expenses (391) (180)
Other personnel expenses (7 397) (8 147)
**Total personnel expenses** **(49 399)** **(50 490)**

###### The personnel expenses of restaurant staff are recorded under "cost of sales", while those of head office staff are recorded under "general and administrative expenses".  These personnel expenses include subsidies for short-time work, which breaks down as follows:

 • Head office: €1.6 million at June 30, 2021 vs. €2.6 million at June 30, 2020
 • Restaurants: €2.0 million at June 30, 2021 vs. €4.7 million at June 30, 2020.

 Personnel expenses at June 30, 2021 were comparable to those at June 30, 2020, as the beginning of 2021 was also impacted by restrictive health measures.

 Other personnel expenses are mainly travel and sundry restaurant staff expenses.

#### 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PPE

###### 8.1. Goodwill

 The goodwill allocated at the Group level is mainly attributable to:

###### 8.4. Impairment losses

8.4.1. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF RESTAURANT CGUS**

###### The Group individually tested 38 restaurants that had been in business for at least 12 months at June 30, 2021, showed an indication of impairment (i.e. a significant decline in sales at the end of June 2021 compared to projected sales), and were mainly located in shopping centers. 

 These tests resulted in no any additional impairment losses.

 The recoverable amount of these CGUs was assessed on the basis of their value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions, which are identical to those used for the assessment at December 31, 2020: 

**In %** **June 2021** **Dec. 2020**
Discount rate 7.00% 7.00%
Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00%
The sales growth rate over the five years of the MTP* 1.50% 1.50%

- This growth rate is not applied until 2022 (when management considers that business will have recovered from the
Covid-19 crisis).

###### Although the CGUs tested were not impaired, management discovered that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

 The Group has individually re-tested the CGUs by changing the key valuation assumptions as follows:
 • Increasing the discount rate by 0.50 percentage points, from 7.00% to 7.50%
 • Decreasing the perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value, from 2% to 1.50%
 • Decreasing the sales growth rate over the 5-year business plan from 1.50% to 0.50% These changes had no material impact on the impairment of restaurant CGUs.

8.4.2. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE**

###### The impairment testing at June 30, 2021 did not require a review of the impairment recognized at December 31, 2020. The recoverable amount of the Group as a whole was therefore not assessed at June 30, 2021. The excess recoverable amount recognized at December 31, 2020 (approximately €593 million) was sufficient. 

 At December 31, 2020, Management had however discovered that a reasonably possible change in the DCF assumptions could cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying amount. The table below shows the assumption percentages at which the recoverable amount will equal the carrying amount.

**Rate at which the recoverable**
**amount will equal the carrying**

**In %** **Dec. 2020**

###### 8.5. Off-balance sheet commitments on assets under construction

 Off-balance sheet commitments granted on assets under construction totaled €4.9 million at June 30, 2021, vs. €7.7 million at December 31, 2020.

 Bank loans

 In June 2020, the Group obtained a government-guaranteed "PGE" loan to meet its cash requirements during the Covid-19 crisis. Of this €80 million loan, €60 million was allocated to France BKR and €20 million to Burger King France. The loan was arranged with a pool of three banks and is backed by a 90% government guarantee.  Although no interest was paid in 2020, a guarantee fee of 0.5% was. 

 In June 2021, the repayment of the government-backed PGE loan was deferred by one year and its maturity was extended for a further year. It will therefore fall due on June 18, 2023.  On June 18, 2021, the guarantee fee was increased from 0.5% to 1.0% and the pool banks will charge interest on their advances at an average rate of Euribor + 0.24% (0% floor).

 Although this loan is due on June 30, 2023, it is classified as a current liability since it may immediately fall due if significant assets are disposed of. Since the planned disposal of the Quick business (see Post-balance sheet events and Note 4.2) would meet this criterion, this loan has been classified as a current liability to ensure consistent accounting treatment.

 - Floating-rate tranche

###### Burger King France's €625 million bond issue of April 21, 2017, which was completed on 19 December 2017, is composed of the following two tranches:

 • A fixed-rate €315 million tranche, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on May 1, 2024 and paying 6% interest (semi-annual)

 • A floating-rate tranche of €310 million, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on May 1, 2023 and paying Euribor +5.25% (quarterly). This tranche was issued in two phases: initially on April 21, 2017 for €250 million, with proceeds of 99.5% and the balance recognized as an issuance discount, and subsequently on 19 December 2017 for €60 million, with proceeds of 101.75% and the balance recognized as an issuance premium.

 Burger King France may prepay all or part of these bonds.

 The €16.9 million in bond issuance costs are spread over the term of the bond. They were €7.4 million at June 30, 2021, vs. €8.8 million at December 31, 2020.

 This change is explained by the spreading out of bond issuance costs in 2021.

###### The change in variable debt after hedging corresponds to a €150 million interest rate cap that expired in May 2021.


-----

###### The revolving credit facility (RCF)

 In April 2017, Burger King France set up a €60 million 5-year RCF with a pool of seven banks. The interest rate from 1 January to June 30, 2021 is Euribor +3.0% (with a 0% floor). 

 As soon as the announcement was made that restaurants would close in March 2020, the Group decided to draw down all of its €60 million RCF line. 

 At the end of June 2020, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million of the RCF line, thus reducing the used portion to €20 million. At June 30, 2021, €20 million of this line of credit had been used. 

 If over 35% of the RCF is used, the Group's quarterly leverage ratio (EBITDA / net debt) must not exceed 7.5.

 On June 30, 2021, the covenant did not apply since less than 35% of the RCF was used.

**Cash liabilities** **-** **(51)**

**Net cash** **149 080** **166 099** **(17 019)**

###### The change in net cash is mainly explained by the transfer of cash from the Group's continuing operations to the discontinued operations.


-----

10.2.3. **COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE MINORITY INTERESTS**

###### The Group has granted Picpain a put option on its interest in Agaquick. The exercise price of this option was calculated using a contractually predetermined formula. The option may be exercised in 2027. 

 Since the non-controlling interests are still entitled to their share of Agaquick's earnings, the Group has opted for a "mixed" accounting treatment of this commitment. 1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement.

 The Group also has an option to purchase all of the shares that Picpain holds in Agaquick, which it may exercise pursuant to the shareholders' agreement in 2039, or in the event of a change in the ownership structure of Picpain's Agaquick shares, or in the event of a legal dispute for which Picpain is held liable.

###### Note 1: the net book value of current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be reasonably approximate to their fair value. 

 Note 2: As allowed under IFRS, the fair value of the lease liability and its level in the fair-value hierarchy is not provided.

 The fair value of other financial instruments was determined as follows:

 • High-yield bonds and floating-rate loans: their fair value is considered to be near their carrying amount, as the impact of a change in the Group's credit spread is considered immaterial
 • Other fixed-rate financial debts and minority buy-out commitment debts: the fair value of debt is determined for each loan by discounting future cash flows at the closing market rate.
 • Standard valuation models were used to estimate the fair value of derivatives.

###### 10.4. Risk management

10.4.1. **GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY**

###### The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate risk. 

 The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its floating-rate debt. 

 Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies.

 The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health. 

10.4.2. **INTEREST RATE RISK**

###### As of May 2021, the Group stopped using caps to hedge its floating-rate bonds. 

 In 2020, the Group used caps to hedge its floating-rate bond debt. These derivatives are qualified as cash flow hedging instruments.

 The table below shows the key characteristics of the derivative instruments used in 2020:

###### Despite the fact that the hedging instruments matured in the first half of 2021, the Group believes that the interest rate risk has not increased, as interest rates are currently negative.

10.4.3. **CURRENCY RISK**

###### The Group's exposure to currency risk is very limited as most of its business is conducted in Europe.

 There were no currency hedging commitments at June 30, 2021 or at December 31, 2020.

 Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk the latter had no material impact on income (as in 2020).

-----

10.4.4. **CREDIT RISK**

###### Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group. 

 Deposits and guarantees

 The credit risk on deposits and guarantees is considered to be limited.

 Cash and cash equivalents

 With regard to cash and cash equivalents, the credit risk is considered to be limited insofar as:

 • they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day-to-day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles.

 • they are invested exclusively in money market instruments.

 Trade receivables

 Trade receivables are the amounts owed by franchisees.

 They may be impaired on the basis of expected credit losses. Indicators of expected losses include, for example, significant financial difficulties of a franchisee or a breach of the franchise agreement (e.g. payment is past due more than x days). These receivables deemed to be at risk are fully impaired if there are indicators of expected credit loss. At June 30, 2021, this impairment totaled €5.5 million, vs. €6.9 million at December 31, 2020. In 2020, the risk of non-recovery was assessed for €2.7 million of the business lease fees for March 2020, the payment dates for which were deferred throughout 2021. In the first half of 2021, franchisees were charged 1/12th of their March 2020 fee each month, with no defaults observed. The provision for this was accordingly decreased to €1.3 million at June 30, 2021.

 A statistics-based provision is made for receivables that are not impaired on the basis of expected credit losses. This statistical provision is based on the history of credit losses actually incurred over the past ten years. At June 30, 2021, this provision was €64 thousand, vs. €64 thousand at December 31, 2020.

 Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables.

10.4.5. **LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE**

###### The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity.

 The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short- term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities.

 Current debt includes the €80 million government-guaranteed "PGE" loan (see Note 10.2). However, the Group plans to repay it when the Quick business is disposed of (see Note 4.2). The Group therefore believes


-----

###### that it has sufficient resources to cover the €211 million in current liabilities, which include the 80 million PGE loan that will immediately fall due if the Quick business is sold.

must be < 7.5 if over 35% of credit line is used

###### At June 30, 2020, the outstanding amount of the RCF credit line was 20 million euros. 

 Since this amount is less than 35% of the credit line, the Group is not required to comply with the following ratio: Consolidated net debt / Consolidated EBITDA < 7.5.

###### 10.5. Off-balance sheet commitments given as collateral for loans

#### 11. INCOME TAX

###### Breakdown of income tax expense

_In 000 EUR_ **June 2021** **June 2020**

Current tax (7 919) 1 006
Deferred tax 8 453 (1 723)
**Income tax** **534** **(717)**

###### Income tax expense is recognized at the amount determined on the basis of the profit before tax for the interim period multiplied by management's best estimate of the weighted average annual tax rate expected for the full year. This rate is adjusted for the tax effect of certain items that are fully recognized in the interim period. Accordingly, the effective tax rate in the interim financial statements may differ from management's estimate of the effective tax rate in the annual financial statements. 

 For the six-month period ending June 30, 2021, the Group's effective tax rate for its continuing operations is 11.53%. This effective tax rate was calculated using the 2021 budgeted operating income after restatement of the IFRS 16 annual financial charges, depreciation and amortization.

##### Statutory Auditors’ Review report on the interim consolidated financial statements

Period from January 1 to June 30, 2021

To the President,

In our quality of statutory auditors of Burger King France S.A.S. and in answer to your request,
we have reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements, for
the period from January 1 to June 30, 2021, ("the Interim Consolidated Financial
**Statements”) as they are attached to this report.**

We highlight that the first set of interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared
as at June 30, consequently we have not audited nor reviewed the corresponding figures
relating to the period from January 1 to June 30, 2020.

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period
have been prepared and reviewed under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the
exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous
consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to
greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and
remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the
performance of the audits.

These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the President. Our
responsibility is to express a conclusion on these Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
based on our review.

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and
the professional doctrine of the French national auditing body (Compagnie nationale des
_commissaires aux comptes) related to this engagement. A review consists primarily of making_
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with

professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are not prepared in conformity with
IAS 34 - International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union related
to financial statements presented for an interim period.

This report is governed by French law. The Courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction in
relation to any claim, dispute or difference concerning the engagement letter or this report, and
any matter arising from them. Every part irrevocably waives any right it may have to object to an
action being brought in any of those Courts, to claim that the action has been brought in an
inconvenient forum or to claim that those Courts do not have jurisdiction.

#### 2. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2019 AND POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS

###### 2.1. Significant events of 2019

 2020 was marked by the following significant events.

 Covid-19 health crisis

 The year 2020 was marked by the Covid-19 health crisis and by the consequences of the French government's measures to stop the pandemic from spreading, which included:

 - the closure of restaurants on 14 March 2020 until at least 15 April 2020.
 - the lockdown requirement, announced on 16 March 2020, requiring everyone residing in France remain at home unless absolutely necessary, until at least 31 March 2020. This lockdown period was subsequently extended.

 As soon as the Burger King France Group learned of the government's initial measures, it closed all Burger King and Quick restaurants. Initially, all restaurants were unable to provide takeaway and/or home delivery service. It quickly became apparent that it would take some time until the Group's restaurants would be able to ensure that their employees and customers were protected from the coronavirus.

 With the exception of a few restaurants for which drive and home delivery sales resumed at the end of April 2020, to enable us to test our pandemic safety measures, the vast majority remained closed for all business until May 6, 2020. As this time and until the end of June, we gradually reopened our restaurants for drive and home delivery service, subject to strict health safety requirements. At the start of June, we were able to resume sales in our restaurants, while complying with social distancing rules. Takeaway and "Click n' Collect" sales were also developed.

 In the third quarter of 2020, we opened all of our restaurants with full service, with the exception of those in airports, train stations and other locations highly dependent on tourism. We observed a strong recovery in business, despite the impact of the mandatory closures of some locations.

 From 30 October 2020, until 15 December 2020, the French government imposed a second nationwide lockdown, which was followed by a 9pm curfew until the end of the year. Unlike during the first lockdown, we were allowed to maintain drive, home delivery, take-away and Click n' Collect service. Only dining areas had to be closed. With the experience gained during the first lockdown, we were able to keep all of our restaurants open (except for those in city centers, shopping malls and "tourist" areas), albeit under deteriorated business conditions.

 Given the uncertainty of the health crisis, when the restaurant closures were announced in March, the Group immediately decided to draw down all of its available credit lines, and most significantly the €60 million RCF line (see Note 10.2).

###### The Group also immediately worked with its creditors to obtain a government-guaranteed "PGE" loan for €80 million at the end of the first half of the year (see Note 10.2).

 After securing this loan, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million on the RCF line and thus reduce its use to €20 million (see Note 10.2).

 To support its franchisees during this period, the Group also agreed to temporary concessions on royalty payments in formal amendments to franchise agreements. This included the waiver of guaranteed minimum royalties during lockdown periods, and the implementation of variable royalty schedules to support the resumption of business activity as of 6 May 2020. These temporary measures resulted in a decrease in royalties and other revenue from franchisees (see Note 6.1.2). 

 During all phases of lockdown and depressed business activity, the Group implemented cost containment measures to reduce the impact of restaurant closures and the sharp drop in or complete lack of in-restaurant sales. These measures included, but were not limited to, the following:
 • Short-time work schedules for restaurant and support staff (see Note 7.2)
 • Suspension or termination of service contracts whenever possible
 • Negotiations with our main partners, insurers, suppliers, and in particular lessors, the impact of which may be seen in our 2020 accounts.

 These measures reduced cash consumption during the first lockdown, partially offset operating losses, and reduced fixed costs in subsequent periods.

 Despite the significant impact of the Covid-19 crisis on its restaurants, the Group has ensured that it has sufficient liquidity to cover its short and medium-term obligations, for itself and for each of its subsidiaries. The ability of the Group and its subsidiaries to continue as going concerns is therefore not at risk. 

 Business development

 After opening 25 restaurants in 2019 (including 22 under the Burger King® brand) and converting 29 restaurants previously operated under the Quick® brand to the Burger King® brand, the Group continued to expand in 2020 with: The opening of 21 new restaurants, including 20 operated under the Burger King® brand The conversion to the Burger King® brand of 9 restaurants formerly operating under the Quick® brand. A significant portion of the investments for this development was assumed by the lessors or supported by the Group's franchisees, thus limiting the Group's remaining net investment.

 System-wide sales

 The Group's system-wide sales totaled €1.08 billion at 31 December 2020, of which €889 million was from continuing operations (€245 million less than the previous year) and €193 million from discontinued operations (for a year-on-year decrease €34 million). The decrease in the Group's system-wide sales is mainly attributable to:
 • The Covid-19 crisis and its impact on restaurant operations
 • The permanent closure or sale of five Quick restaurants However, this decline was partially offset by the opening of 21 restaurants (of which 20 under the Burger King® brand) and the conversion of 9 Quick® restaurants to Burger King®.

###### 2.2. Post-balance sheet events

 The beginning of 2021 was marked by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and the French government's new health measures, which included a 6pm curfew, the closure of large shopping centers, and local lockdown restrictions on weekends. 

 Despite these measures, the vast majority of the Group's restaurants continued to operate, albeit under less favorable conditions.


-----

#### 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION

###### 3.1. Declaration of conformity

 The consolidated financial statements of the Burger King France Group for 2020 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the IASB as adopted mandatorily in the European Union at 31 December 2020, and with SIC and IFRIC interpretations thereof.  All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-andsupplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adoptinginternational-accounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric

###### 3.2. Changes in the accounting framework

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2020

 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2020 are:

 • Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of "significant"

 • Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Benchmark Reform (Phase 1)

 • Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business

 • Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards

 • Amendment to IFRS 16 - Leases: Covid-19 related rent concessions granted to lessees, applicable as of 1 June 2020.

 Note: the consequences of the IFRS IC's decision published in December 2019 on the terms of lease within the scope of IFRS 16 have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2020, by retrospectively amending the 2019 consolidated financial statements (see Note 3.6).

 Apart from the changes to IFRS 16 (the effects of which are explained in Note 3.6), the other standards had no impact on the Group's accounts. 

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2021

 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2021:

 - Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 - Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Reform of benchmark interest rates (Phase 2).

 At the time of this publication, the Group does not expect these new standards to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.


-----

###### 3.3. Use of estimates and judgments

 In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements.

 The Group's management makes these estimates and assessments on an ongoing basis, based on past experience and various factors it considers to be reasonable.

 Unexpected changes in events and circumstances, and particularly in the economic environment of the Group's business activity, may cause its financial results to differ from these estimates. 

 The most significant estimates and judgments that the management of Burger King France Group has made in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant impact on its financial statements mainly have to do with:
 • Impairment tests on fixed assets and goodwill (Note 8.4)
 • The measurement of rights of use and lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16 (Notes 8.3.2)

 3.4. Methods used to translate foreign currency transactions

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's functional currency. Amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand euros, unless otherwise stated. 

 Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement.

 3.5. Basis of assessment

 The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivatives which are measured at fair value.

 3.6. Impacts of the application of the IFRS IC decision issued on 16 December 2019"

3.6.1. PRINCIPLE

###### On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC issued a decision clarifying the determination of the terms for leases within the scope of IFRS 16 - Leases, and in particular:
 - the determination of the enforceable period of a lease that is automatically renewable or which has an indefinite term, and which may be terminated by a party to the lease with due notice. One of the issues raised was the concept of "penalty", which serves to determine the enforceable period. - the link between the depreciation period for fixtures and fittings that cannot be separated from the leased asset, and the term of the lease under IFRS 16.


-----

###### The IFRS IC has: 
 - concluded that an economic (rather than a strictly legal) approach should be used to determine a lease's enforceable period - clarified the link between the IFRS 16 lease term and the depreciation period for fixtures and fittings that cannot be separated from the leased asset.

 In determining the IFRS 16 terms of French "3/6/9" leases, which moreover are automatically renewable, the Group has also taken into consideration the conclusions of the ANC (the French accounting standards authority), issued on July 3, 2020 and which supersede those of 16 February 2018. The Group has conducted analyses to determine the effects of this and made the necessary changes to its financial and accounting information systems in the second half of 2020.

 The main impact of the ANC's decision was to extend the IFRS 16 term of certain leases and increase the rights of use and commitments for these leases correspondingly. The impacts of this change in accounting policy were recognized retrospectively as of the IFRS 16 transition date, i.e. 1 January 2019. The consolidated financial statements for 2019 have also been restated in accordance with this decision.

 Our analyses focused in particular on leases of underlying assets (restaurants) with inseparable fixtures and fittings and a residual net book value at the end of the IFRS 16 term that could result in a significant penalty (within the meaning of the IFRS IC decision) for the Group. For such leases, it was sometimes necessary to extend the IFRS 16 lease term.

3.6.2. **IMPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

###### The Group has opted to observe the simplified retrospective method as of 1 January 2019. The 2018 financial statements have thus not been restated.  The total impact of the application of IFRS 16 and the IFRS IC's decision on the balance sheet is €417.7 million at January 1, 2019 (vs. €374.5 million in the 2019 consolidated financial statements).

 The effects of the transition are summarized in the table below.

###### The comparative 2019 income statement, consolidated statement of financial position and cash flow statement were restated to account for the application of the IFRS IC's decision of 16 December 2019.

 The IFRS 16 accounting principles observed for the consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2019 are described in Note 8.3.2.

#### 4. CONSOLIDATION SCOPE

###### 4.1. Accounting principles observed for the scope of consolidation


###### Consolidation of subsidiaries


###### A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. The Group controls a company when it is exposed to, or is entitled to, variable returns from its relationship with the company and may have an impact on these returns through its control over the company. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date that such control is initially obtained and until it ceases.


###### Equity method of accounting for joint ventures


###### A joint venture is a form of partnership that gives the Group joint control over a company and rights to the net assets of the joint venture, but no rights to its assets or obligations in respect of its liabilities. Burger King France uses the equity method to account for its joint ventures.


###### 4.2. Business combinations


###### Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities are generally recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date.


###### Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any interest previously held in the acquiree) plus the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognized (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Non- controlling interests are measured when control is gained, either pro rata to the identifiable net assets or at fair value, depending on the option selected. 


###### When the difference thus determined is negative, and after the various components are remeasured, it can be immediately taken to income, in "other non-recurring income and expenses".


###### Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment loss. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement and are irreversible.


-----

###### The table below shows the calculation of goodwill from the Group's acquisition of companies.

Dorli Burger 01/ 07/ 2020 100% 237   - 37 200

(1) measured pro rate the net identifiable assets.

###### In accordance with the Group's accounting principles, this €1 million in goodwill is allocated to the Group CGU.

 The following table shows the cash flows associated with these acquisitions.

_In 000 EUR_ **Dec. 2020**

Cash consideration (1 946)
Cash and cash equivalents of the companies acquired 935

**Acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash** **(1 011)**

###### A total of €(1,011) thousand for "Acquisitions of subsidiaries, net of cash" was recorded in the cash flow statement.

 Acquisition expenses are recorded in "Other non-current operating expenses". No significant costs were recognized in 2020. 

 The contribution of these companies to sales and franchise income and to annual income, from their date of acquisition to 31 December 2020, is immaterial.


-----

###### 4.3. Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities held for sale


###### A non-current asset or a group of associated assets and liabilities is considered to be held for sale in the following cases, in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”: 

 • the asset or group is available for immediate sale in its present condition
 • its sale is highly likely, which is the case when management has undertaken efforts to sell the asset or
 group and to find a buyer at a reasonable price and has committed to sell it within one year. Non-current assets, groups of assets or businesses held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value (i.e. the estimated selling price), net of disposal costs. They are presented on a separate line on the balance sheet and are no longer depreciated or amortized. Joint ventures are no longer accounted for using the equity method.

 A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's operations which has business activities and cash flows that are clearly distinct from those of the rest of the Group, and which:

 • represents a major and distinct line of business or geographic area
 • is part of a coordinated plan to divest a major and distinct line of business or geographic area, or
 • is a subsidiary acquired exclusively to be resold.

 The classification takes place on the date of disposal or earlier if the activity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.

 When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had met the criteria of a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period.


###### In order to focus on the development of the Burger King brand in France, since 2019 the Group has been reorganizing Quick's business activities into a separate group of companies to facilitate their sale. 

 During the first year, the restrictive measures imposed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus prevented the formal launching of the process to sell Quick business activities. However, throughout this period, the Group took the necessary steps to prepare for this sale, which included setting up a dedicated management structure and proceeding with the legal reorganization of the businesses to be sold.

 In view of this reorganization and the steps already taken, the Group considers that the sale of this business is very likely within the next twelve months and that it meets the IFRS 15 classification criteria. 


-----

4.3.1. **ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE**

###### The group of companies to be sold consists of the following assets and liabilities at 31 December 2020

_In 000 EUR_ **Dec. 2020** **Dec. 2019**

Goodwill 47 584 45 193

Intangible assets 113 053 113 018

Property, plant and equipment 124 289 103 277

Inventories 91 124

Trade and other receivables 12 058 7 163

Cash and cash equivalents 2 031 2 700
Assets held for sale 299 106 271 475

Lease liabilities 59 903 54 188

Trade and other payables 13 414 6 912

Liabilities held for sale 73 317 61 100

###### The above assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value. The increase in goodwill is attributable to the reclassification of business acquisitions and contractual compensation paid to franchisees (see Note 8.1).

 The increase in property, plant and equipment is attributable to the increase in rights of use resulting from the renewal of some leases in 2020.

###### The changes in the scope of consolidation in 2020 are described in Note 4.2 "Change in the scope of consolidation". The companies accounted for by the equity method are joint ventures of immaterial importance.

 The Group has fully consolidated its 50% interest in the Agaquick sub-group since it considers that it controls Agaquick.


-----

###### 4.5. Share attributable to non-controlling interests

 Non-controlling interests are initially measured either at their fair value or at the pro rata share of the net identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date. Changes in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

 The non-controlling interests are:
 • The sub-group consisting of Agaquick SAS and its subsidiaries, in which the Group has a 50% stake
 • BK Expansion, 84.44% of which is owned by the Group
 • BK Développement, 73.12% of which is owned by the Group
 • Flagship, 50.71% of which is owned by the Group
 • BK Croissance and BK Exploitation, of which the Group holds 3.21%
 • SL2R and its subsidiary ADFR, 55.08% of which is owned by the Group
 • SN2R and its subsidiary Houdemont, 76.91% of which is owned by the Group.

#### 5. SEGMENT INFORMATION


###### Under IFRS 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity:



###### • that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses
 • whose operational results are regularly monitored by the chief operating decision maker
 • for which separate financial information is available.

 The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") is its Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

 The Group's business activity, which constitutes a single operating segment, is operating restaurants in France under franchise agreements or which it owns. 

 Note 6.1 provides a breakdown of revenue by type of product and service, with a distinction between merchandise sales by company-owned restaurants and income from franchise agreements.  All sales are generated in France. No individual customer is of significant size.


-----

#### 6. OPERATIONS INFORMATION

###### 6.1. Sales and franchise revenues


###### Sales and franchise income consist of:

 • the sales of foodservice products and services through company-operated restaurants within the scope
 of IFRS 15
 • brand royalties and other income paid by franchisees within the scope of IFRS 15
 • sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees
 • entry fees and other sales, which include network access fees and entry fees invoiced to franchisees and
 revenue from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees.


Note **Amount** **%** **Amount** **%**
Sales to consumers 6.1.1 178 299 49% 290 406 59%
Franchisee royalties 6.1.2 149 348 41% 176 726 36%
Sales of merchandise and equipment to 6.1.3 2 866 1% 7 540 2%
franchises

Entry fees and other sales 6.1.4 33 889 9% 15 874 3%
**Sales and franchise revenues** **364 402** **100%** **490 546** **100%**

6.1.1. **CONSUMER SALES**


###### Revenue from sales to consumers includes the revenue from the sale of hamburgers and other food products at the Group's company-owned restaurants and of related catering services. 

 Sales revenue is recognized when the control of the products sold (the "merchandise") is transferred to the customer, i.e. when payment is made at the cash register for sales to consumers in company-operated restaurants.

 Revenue is valued net of returns, rebates, trade discounts and quantity discounts.


###### Sales to consumers amounted to €178.3 million in 2020, vs. €290.4 million in 2019, for a decrease of €112.1 million.

 This decrease is mainly due to the Covid-19 crisis measures, and to a lesser extent to the transfer of eight directly operated restaurants to a franchisee and the closure of one directly operated restaurant. This decrease was partially offset by three new directly operated restaurants, two of which were previously operated under a franchise agreement and one of which was opened.


-----

6.1.2. **ROYALTIES AND OTHER CHARGES TO FRANCHISEES**


###### The various types of franchise agreements are: full franchise, shared franchise, business lease, and business lease with investment. The percentage paid depends on the type of agreement. Royalties and other charges to franchisees (excluding rent) comprise:

 • the royalties received from franchisees for the use of the Burger King® and Quick® brands.

 • National advertising fees received from franchisees as their contribution to the national advertising
 budget

 • Business lease fees received from the leasing of Group-owned businesses.

 Brand royalties 

 Each month, franchisees are invoiced for brand royalties, the amount of which is a contractual percentage of their sales and other income. These royalties are recognized when the franchise revenue is earned, in accordance with the royalty exemption provided for under IFRS 15, with the exception of annual guaranteed minimums which are recognized on a straight-line basis.

 National advertising charges 

 Franchisees are billed monthly for their contribution to the national advertising budget, which is a percentage of the franchise's revenue. It is recorded when this revenue is earned, as it is considered that national advertising activities do not apply to any service that is distinct from the license to use the brand and the know-how.

 Business lease royalties

 As lessor, Burger King France Group has entered into real property leases and business leases (with or without investment) with its franchisees.

 The term of business leases is 9+9 years for Burger King® restaurants, and from 3 to 12 years for Quick restaurants.

 The royalties paid under these leases are a contractual percentage of the franchise revenue and are invoiced in consideration of the use of the business assets, the occupation of the premises and the leasehold interest.

 These business leases are operating leases for the lessor under IFRS 16.

 Lease payments are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 


###### The Group had 325 franchised restaurants at 31 December 2020, vs. 304 at 31 December 2019.
 The total transaction price for services that were not fully provided at the balance sheet date is immaterial.
 Franchise royalties totaled €149.3 million in 2020, which is €27.4 million less than in 2019 (€176.7 million). This decrease is mainly attributable to:
 • the impact of the Covid-19 measures on the sales of our franchisees 


-----

###### • the Group's efforts to support franchisees during the Covid-19 crisis, which included temporary concessions on royalty payments in formal amendments to franchise agreements, the waiver of guaranteed minimum royalties during lockdown periods, and the implementation of variable royalty schedules to support the resumption of business activity.
 • the Group's direct operation of two restaurants previously operated under franchise agreements
 • the permanent closure or sale of four restaurants. This decrease was partially offset by the transfer of eight restaurants previously operated to franchisees and the opening of 19 restaurants under franchise agreements.
 Future minimum guaranteed payments of royalties:

6.1.3. **SALES OF MERCHANDISE AND EQUIPMENT TO FRANCHISES**


###### Merchandise and equipment are sold to franchisees by the Group's subsidiary Logirest France.

 Revenue from the sale of merchandise and equipment is recognized when their control is transferred to the franchisee, which is the invoice date.


###### Sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees totaled €2.9 million in 2020 vs. €7.5 million in 2019. This decrease is mainly due to the Group's outsourcing, late in Q1 2019, of its purchasing and logistics business for its Quick® restaurants. However, subsidiary Logirest still continues to directly operate an equipment sales and logistics business. 


-----

6.1.4. **ENTRY FEES AND OTHER SALES**


###### Network entry and franchise entry fees.

 Network entry and franchise entry fees are charged to franchisees in consideration of the transfer of know-how, the use of the brand, territorial exclusivity and assistance in opening a restaurant.

 They are invoiced at the start of the contract. As with brand royalties, they are considered to be remuneration for the license to use the trademark and know-how, and not remuneration for distinct services. 

 As this is a "variable license" within the meaning of IFRS 15, this income is recognized over the term of the franchise agreement, and on a straight-line basis, since it is considered that the Group's services as a franchisor are provided uniformly over the term of the agreement.

 Fees invoiced at the start of the contract that have not yet been recognized in "Sales and franchise income" are recognized in current and non-current deferred income.

 Other revenue

 Other revenue consist mainly of the from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees.

###### 6.2. Gross and operating profit and margin


###### Cost of sales comprises the cost of supplies and merchandise, the cost of restaurant staff and the cost of other sales to the Group's non-franchised external partners.

 • The cost of supplies and merchandise consists of is the cost of the raw materials and merchandise
 required to make the finished products sold to consumers (see Note 6.1.1), the cost of the raw materials, merchandise and equipment the Group sells to franchisees (see Note 6.1.3), and the incurred costs of materials and services that are necessary to provide the services sold to the Group's external and non- franchised partners (see Note 6.1.4).
 • Restaurant personnel costs include salaries, the employer's social security charges, and the benefits paid
 to Group employees whose work is directly related to the selling of products to consumers (see Note 6.1.1)

 Occupancy and operating costs mainly include the costs of energy, maintenance, security, and taxes (business tax, property tax, etc.). Depreciation corresponds to the depreciation or amortization of restaurant assets and rights of use.

6.5.2. **TRADE RECEIVABLES**


###### Trade and other operating receivables are initially recognized at their fair value, which is generally their nominal value. There are no trade receivables that are pledged or insured. 
 In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group uses the simplified method to measure trade receivables and recognizes expected credit losses over the life of the receivable. Expected credit losses are estimated using an allowance matrix that is based on historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for specific factors relating to the creditor, current general economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions that are obtainable at the balance sheet date without incurring undue cost or effort.

**Net total** **52 977** **41 475** **11 502**

###### The increase in trade receivables in 2020 is mainly due to the deferral of business lease payments granted to franchisees.

6.5.6. **CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL**

###### The change in the working capital requirement breaks down as follows:

_In 000 EUR_ **Dec. 2020** **Dec. 2019**

Effect of change in inventories 270 6 590
Effect of change in trade receivables and other current assets (16 612) 18 653
Effect of change in trade payables and other liabilities 6 631 (25 488)

**Total** **(9 711)** **(245)**

###### The negative impact of the change in trade receivables (€16.6) million in 2020 vs. 2019 is mainly attributable to:
 - The deferral until 2021 of the payment of franchisee brand royalties, advertising expenses and lease payments of March 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 crisis  
 The positive impact of the change in trade payables and other current liabilities (€6.6 million) is mainly due to:
 - The increase in trade payables on leases subsequent to renegotiations with landlords in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. 

 6.6. Non-current financial assets


###### Loans and guarantees pertain mainly to the Group's operating leases as lessee. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost. 
 The Group uses caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives are measured at fair value. The method used to recognize changes in their fair value depends on whether there is a documented hedging relationship as defined in IFRS 9: 

 • in the absence of a hedging relationship, changes in fair value are taken to income
 • if there is a documented relationship for hedging cash flows, the change in the fair value of the effective
 portion of the hedging derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income while that of the ineffective portion is directly taken to the income statement. 


-----

###### However, the time value of the options is recognized separately as a hedging cost. It is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve within equity. It is recycled to the income statement over the term of the hedge.

###### Non-current financial assets consist of the following:

#### 7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

###### 7.1. Workforce

 The workforce includes employees employed under fixed-term and permanent contracts.
 The Group's average full-time equivalent headcount was 3,246 in 2020, vs. 3,448 in 2019.

 7.2. Personnel expenses

 Personnel expenses are recognized as services are provided.
 The table below shows personnel expenses recognized in ordinary operating income.

Training expenses (559) (736)
Other personnel expenses (14 865) (11 866)
**Total personnel expenses** **(101 055)** **(125 610)**

###### The personnel expenses of restaurant staff are recorded under "cost of sales", while those of head office staff are recorded under "general and administrative expenses".
 The decrease in salaries and personnel expenses in 2020 was mainly due to the short-time work implemented when restaurants were closed during the lockdowns and after curfews. The French government's short-time work subsidies totaled €8.3 million.
 Other personnel expenses are mainly travel and sundry restaurant staff expenses.


-----

###### 7.3. Employee benefits

 The Group's employees receive short-term benefits (paid leave, sick leave, etc.), post-employment benefits based on defined contributions (social security plans and ARRCO/AGIRC supplementary pension plans) and on defined benefits (lump-sum retirement payments), as well as other long-term benefits (length-of-service and long-service bonuses).

**Total** **3 387** **3 535**


7.3.1. **LUMP-SUM RETIREMENT PAYMENTS**


###### French law provides for the payment of a lump-sum retirement benefit that is a function of the employees' length of service with the Group and his or her salary at the time of retirement. 
 The Group's obligation in respect of this benefit is valued annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Revaluations of the liability (actuarial gains and losses) are recognized in other comprehensive income. The service cost is recognized as an operating expense, in "general and administrative expenses", while the associated interest expense is recognized as a financial expense.

7.3.2. **OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

###### At 31 December 2020, the Group recognized €174 thousand for length-of-service bonuses and long-service awards (vs. €151 thousand in 2019).

 7.4. Share-based compensation

 The fair value of performance shares granted to employees is recognized in income in "other non-current expenses" over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
 This fair value was determined using an EBITDA-multiple model, the terms of vesting plans, the market data available at the grant date and the assumptions of the Group’s management.
 For its RSU plan, implemented in 2018, the Group recognized an expense of €75 thousand in 2020, vs. €2.7 million in 2019.

 7.5. Compensation of key management personnel (related parties)

 In 2020, key executives received compensation of €3.0 million, compared to €3.1 million in 2019. 
 This compensation includes the salaries of these executives, benefits in kind, contributions to defined contribution post-employment benefit plans and the expense of defined benefit post-employment plan. These executives are also entitled to RSU (see Note 7.4).

#### 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PPE

###### 8.1. Goodwill

 Goodwill is mainly attributable to the following:
 • in December 2015, the acquisition by Burger King France SAS of 100% of the capital of Financière Quick SAS (€171 million), less the proceeds from the disposal of operations in Belgium and Luxembourg in 2016 (€44 million)
 • in 2017, the acquisition of BDBK and PINTO (€76 million)
 • in 2018, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€9 million)
 • in 2019, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€2 million)
 • in 2020, the acquisition of four individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€2 million) and the increase in individually immaterial company business goodwill (€869 thousand) 
 • the classification, since December 31, 2019, of the Quick business goodwill as an asset held for sale. 
 The table below shows the change in goodwill.

###### 8.2. Other intangible assets


###### Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost while those acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 


###### After their initial recognition, intangible assets are not remeasured. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment (see Note 8.4).

 The "Quick®" brand

 The "Quick®" brand, which has been classified under IFRS 5 since 31 December 2019, is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, in consideration of the fact that it is almost 40 years old and its reputation. There is assumed to be no foreseeable limit to the period during which the brand will generate net cash inflows for the Group. 

 Other intangible assets with finite useful lives

 Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist mainly of software and patents, licenses and concessions. The amortization of these assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Number of years

Software 3 to 7
Patents, licenses and concessions 5

8.3.2. **RIGHTS OF USE**

###### LEASES
 The Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases for the first time on 1 January 2019. 
 Lessees are required to recognize all leases (with some exceptions) in a way that is largely similar to the method required for finance leases under IAS 17, i.e. recognizing as an asset the right to use the underlying leased asset, and as a lease liability the obligation to pay lease payments over the lease term. However, the standard provides for exemptions for leases of 12 months or less an leases for low-value assets. The Group has used these two exemptions.  Under IFRS 16, a contract or part of a contract is or contains a lease if it grants the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
 The Group has observed IFRS 16 in accordance with the simplified retrospective method, which recommends recording the cumulative effect of the adoption of IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the balance of reserves at 1 January 2019.  The Group presents the "rights of use" asset in the statement of financial position under property, plant and equipment on the same line as the underlying asset of the same nature that it owns in full, and presents lease liabilities on the "current/non-current lease liabilities" lines of "current/non-current financial liabilities".  The Group recognizes a "right-of-use" asset and a lease liability at the inception of the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, with possible adjustment to account for certain revaluations of the lease liability. 
 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments due but not yet paid at the start date of the contract. The discount rate used corresponds to the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if this cannot be easily determined, the marginal borrowing rate (based on the lending term and not the maturity date). The Group uses the marginal borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is then increased by the interest expense and reduced by the amount of the lease payments. It is remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments subsequent to a change in an index or rate or to a re-estimation of the amount payable under a residual value guarantee, or in the event of a revaluation of the exercise of a purchase option or the extension or non-exercise of a termination option (in which case said payments becomes reasonably certain). 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on rights of use and lease liabilities, considering that tax deductions on lease payments are attributable to the liability and then offset.
 On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC issued its final decision on the assessment of lease terms and depreciation periods for immovable fixtures and fittings, deeming it unnecessary to amend IFRS 16 to clarify the concept of "enforceable period".  With this decision, the Committee seeks to clarify the method used to determine the lease term, since it does not accept the legal approach of determining the period during which a lease is enforceable solely on the basis of the terms of the lease agreement. The Committee thus considers that a lease remains enforceable for as long as the lessee or the lessor would suffer a significant loss if the lease were terminated. Accordingly, even in the absence of an option that enables the lessee to extend a lease at its discretion, the reasonably certain term of the lease must be assessed to determine the corresponding lease liability and the value of the right of use. In the


-----

###### Committee's view, the concept of "loss" should be considered broadly and not limited to contractual or monetary penalties.   With regard to the depreciation period for immovable fittings and fixtures, the Committee notes that: 
 - The term of a lease should be taken into account when determining the depreciation period of the fittings and fixtures
 - The existence of fixtures or fittings that are not fully depreciated and which would have to be abandoned and removed if the lease is terminated is one example of a loss to be considered when determining the lease's enforceable period. 
 In determining the IFRS 16 terms of French "3/6/9" leases, which moreover are automatically renewable, the Group has also taken into consideration the conclusions of the ANC (the French accounting standards authority), issued on July 3, 2020 and which supersede those of 16 February 2018.
 LEASE PREMIUMS
 A lease premium is inseparable from the lease itself since the lessee could not have entered into the lease agreement without incurring the cost of the lease premium and would not have incurred that cost if it had not been able to enter into the lease agreement. Therefore, the lease premium is a direct cost initially incurred by the Group as lessee that is included in the initial measurement of the right of use. 
 It was considered that the right of use is composed of the following two significant and distinct elements, which need to be amortized separately as their future economic benefits are consumed at different rates:

 - the lease premium

 - the other leasehold interests that constitute the right of use.

 For the lease premium, an analysis of the relevant restaurants showed that in the vast majority of cases the restaurant's location and "premium" characteristics ensured that the lease premium's value at the end of the lease would be at least equivalent to its current value. Accordingly, this component was not amortized.
 The other components of the right of use are amortized over the useful life of the right of use, which is the lease term.

###### 8.4. Impairment of intangible assets


###### Whenever warranted by a significant internal or external event or circumstance, the Group performs impairment tests on its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and assets under construction are also tested annually for impairment.
 The Group performed asset impairment tests at the following two levels:

 • On each Cash Generating Unit (CGU), which is defined as the smallest group of assets whose cash flows
 are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets. For the Group, each restaurant corresponds to a CGU, whether directly operated or franchised. The net book value of CGUs includes all tangible and intangible assets, except for the brand and goodwill.

 • At the level of the group of CGUs which comprise the Group as a whole, including goodwill, the brand
 and all other tangible and intangible assets, since it is at this level that the Group can monitor the synergy gains of business combinations.


###### This impairment test consists of comparing the recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) with its carrying amount, including rights of use.
 The recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) is the higher of its value in use or its fair value less the cost of disposal. 
 Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of assets. Cash flow projections are based on the Group's five-year business plan restated for the new IFRS 16 standard (lease cancellation) and are extrapolated to infinity at a long-term growth rate. 
 Cash flows are discounted at the WACC based on market assumptions. This rate is calculated using the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and a size premium. It does not include the Group's debt and tax structure. 
 When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value of the asset or group of assets tested, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In the case of a group of assets, the impairment is initially charged to goodwill.
 If the recoverable amount of an asset other than goodwill rises back above its net book value at a later date the impairment loss recognized on this asset may be reversed. This reversal cannot exceed the impairment loss initially recorded less any depreciation or amortization that would otherwise have been recognized. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed.

8.4.1. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF RESTAURANT CGUs**

###### The Group individually tested 309 restaurants that had been in operation for at least 12 months at 31 December 2020. 
 These tests resulted in the following impairment losses for five restaurants in 2020 (vs. 5 restaurants in 2019), which were recorded in other non-current operating expenses:

**Dec. 2019** **Dec. 2018**

**Net book** **Recove-** **Impair-** **Net book** **Recover-** **Impair-**

In 000 EUR

**value** **rable value** **ment** **value** **able value** **ment**

Property, plant and equipment 8 083 4 551 (3 532) 5 507 3 090 (2 416)
**Total restaurant CGU & impairment** **9 688** **4 551** **(5 137)** **6 000** **3 372** **(2 628)**

###### The recoverable amount of these CGUs was assessed on the basis of their value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions: 

**In %** **Dec. 2020** **Dec. 2019**

Discount rate 7.00% 8.10%

Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00%

Sales growth rate over the five years of the business plan * 1.50% 1.50%

- This growth rate is not applied until 2022 (when management considers that business will have recovered from the Covid19 crisis).

###### The following factors were taken into account to determine the discount rate:
 • the risk-free rate, which is the historical average of the yields of eurozone long-term government bonds;
 • a market risk premium of 7.9% at 31 December 2020, which is based on the historical average of equity market returns observed in the eurozone;
 • the size premium, which is the excess return that is necessary to compensate for the risk associated with the company's size relative to other companies in its market. The size premium used at 31 December 2020 is 1.9% (vs. 2.8% at 31 December 2019).
 For the CGUs that are not impaired, management has determined that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
 The Group has individually re-tested the non-impaired CGUs by changing the key valuation assumptions as follows:
 • Increasing the discount rate from 7% to 7.50%
 • Decreasing the perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value, from 2% to 1.50%
 • Decreasing the sales growth rate over the 5-year business plan from 1.50% to 0.50% These changes had no material impact on the impairment of restaurant CGUs individually or in aggregate.


-----

8.4.2. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE**

###### The recoverable amount of the Group as a whole was assessed on the basis of its value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions: 

**In %** **Dec. 2020** **Dec. 2019**

Discount rate 7.00% 8.10%
Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00%

Sales growth rate over the five years of the business plan * 1.50% 1.50%

- This growth rate is not applied until 2022 (when management considers that business will have recovered from the Covid19 crisis).

###### The Group's estimated recoverable amount at 31 December 2020 exceeds its carrying amount by approximately €593 million.
 Management has determined that a reasonably possible change in the DCF assumptions could cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying amount. The table below shows the assumption percentages at which the recoverable amount will equal the carrying amount. Rate at which the recoverable value will equal the net book value.

**Rate at which the recoverable**
**value will equal the net book**
**value**

**In %** **Dec. 2020** **Dec. 2019**

Discount rate 11.76% 13.60%

Sales growth rate used to determine the terminal value (6.19%) (15.30%)

###### 8.5. Off-balance sheet commitments on assets under construction 

 Off-balance sheet commitments granted on assets under construction totaled €7.7 million at 31 December 2020, vs. €4.0 million at 31 December 2019.

#### 9. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS


###### A provision is recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation at the balance sheet date which is due to a past event that is likely to result in an outflow of resources, the amount of which can be reliably estimated.


###### The provision is the best estimate of the amount that is required to settle the current obligation as of the balance sheet date.

###### Employee benefits are described in Note 7.3.
 In 2020, the changes concern disputes with employees and tax authorities.
 The Group is also involved in several legal proceedings with another of France Quick's former international master franchisee, for which the Group has made no provision as it does not consider this risk to be material.
 The change in provisions for commercial, legal and employee dispute risks in 2019 is mainly explained by the reversal of the provision recognized in 2016 for a dispute with a former France Quick international master franchisee.

 In an arbitration decision issued in the second quarter of 2019, the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris found France Quick's decision to terminate its franchise and brand agreements on the grounds of an irremediable breach to be wrongful and ordered France Quick to compensate this former franchisee for its expenses and investments. The provision recognized over the previous years was therefore reversed and the associated expense was recorded under "Other non-recurring income and expenses", and the attachment was released.

#### 10. FINANCIAL MATTERS AND INSTRUMENTS

###### 10.1. Net financial income/expense


###### The cost of gross financial debt consists mainly of interest paid on bonds, credit-line fees (unused RCF), fees on PGE government-guaranteed loans, and interest on other bank debts. 
 The cost of net financial debt is the cost of gross financial debt plus income from investments in cash equivalents. 
 Other financial income and expenses consist mainly of:



###### • Interest on lease liabilities
 • Mandatory refinancing costs
 • Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments (caps and swaps) 
 • Pro-rated cap premiums
 • Various bank charges
 • Interest on post-employment plan liabilities.
 Interest is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
 The table below breaks down the Group's net financial income.

###### 10.2. Financial liabilities, liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests, and lease liabilities

 Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. 
 Non-current financial liabilities consist mainly of bond liabilities, which are recorded net of refinancing costs due in more than year, and bank debt due in more than one year. Current financial liabilities consist of bank debt that is due over the next twelve months, the portion of bond refinancing costs due within one year, bank overdrafts, the PGE government-guaranteed loan, and accrued interest on loans.
 Financial liabilities, liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests, and lease liabilities are shown in the table below:

###### All debts were contracted in euros.
 Bank loans

 In June 2020, the Group obtained a government-guaranteed "PGE" loan to meet its cash requirements during the Covid-19 crisis. Of this €80 million loan, €60 million was allocated to France Quick and €20 million to Burger King France. The loan was arranged with a pool of three banks and is backed by a 90% government guarantee.  Although no interest was due in 2020, there is a guarantee fee of 0.5%.  The term of the loan is 12 months. It may be extended annually for up to five years.  
 Although the Group may automatically extend the term of this loan beyond the initial 12 months, it is classified as a current liability since it may immediately fall due if significant assets are disposed of. Since the planned disposal of the Quick business (see Note 4.3) would meet this criterion, for reasons of consistency this loan has been classified as current debt, even though the Group plans to have the loan automatically extended pending the completion of this disposal.

 • A fixed-rate €315 million tranche, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on 1 May 2024 and paying 6% interest (semi-annual)
 • A floating-rate tranche of €310 million, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on 1 May 2023 and paying Euribor +5.25% (quarterly). This tranche was issued in two phases: initially on 21 April 2017 for €250 million, with proceeds of 99.5% and the balance recognized as an issuance discount, and subsequently on 19 December 2017 for €60 million, with proceeds of 101.75% and the balance recognized as an issuance premium. 
 Burger King France may call some or all of these bonds.
 The €16.9 million in bond issuance costs are spread over the term of the bond. They were €8.8 million at 31 December 2020, vs. €11.4 million at 31 December 2019.
 This change is explained by the spreading out of bond issuance costs in 2020.

###### The change in variable debt after hedging corresponds to a €50 million interest rate cap that expired in May 2020.

###### The revolving credit facility (RCF)

 In April 2017, Burger King France set up a €60 million 5-year RCF with a pool of seven banks. The current margin is Euribor +2.5%, with a 0% floor. 
 As soon as the announcement was made that restaurants would close in March 2020, the Group decided to draw down all of its €60 million RCF line. 
 At the end of June, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million of the RCF line, thus reducing the used portion to €20 million. At December 31, 2020, €20 million of this line of credit had been used. 
 If over 35% of the RCF is used, the Group's quarterly leverage ratio (EBITDA / net debt) must not exceed 7.5.
 Although this ratio was exceeded at December 31, 2020, the covenant did not apply since less than 35% of the RCF was used. 

10.2.2. **CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS**


###### Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are exposed to an insignificant risk of loss.
 In the cash flow statement, this item is composed of cash and cash equivalents, less bank overdrafts.

###### The change in net cash is mainly explained by the granting of the government-guaranteed PGE loan.


-----

10.2.3. **COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE MINORITY INTERESTS**

###### Liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests are recorded at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the put option granted to the minority shareholder relative to the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests. The difference between the liability thus recorded and the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 
 After its initial recognition, the liability is carried at amortized cost and subsequent changes are recognized in equity.
 In the consolidated income statement, a share of the net income of the Agaquick sub-group is allocated to the non-controlling interests that are still entitled to a share of the subsidiary's earnings.
 The Group has granted Picpain a put option on its interest in Agaquick. The exercise price of this option was calculated using a contractually predetermined formula. The option may be exercised in 2027. 
 Since the non-controlling interests are still entitled to their share of Agaquick's earnings, the Group has opted for a "mixed" accounting treatment of this commitment. 1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement.
 The Group also has an option to purchase all of the shares that Picpain holds in Agaquick, which it may exercise pursuant to the shareholders' agreement in 2039, or in the event of a change in the ownership structure of Picpain's Agaquick shares, or in the event of a legal dispute for which Picpain is held liable.

###### Note 1: the net book value of current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be reasonably approximate to their fair value. 

 Note 2: As allowed under IFRS, the fair value of the lease liability and its level in the fair-value hierarchy is not provided.

 The fair value of other financial instruments was determined as follows:

 • High-yield bonds and variable-rate loans: their fair value is considered to be near their carrying amount, as the impact of a change in the Group's credit spread is considered immaterial
 • Other fixed-rate financial debts and minority buy-out commitment debts: the fair value of each debt is determined by discounting future cash flows at the closing market rate, which is adjusted to account for the Group's credit risk.
 • Standard valuation models were used to estimate the fair value of derivatives.

###### 10.4. Risk management

10.4.1. **GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY**

###### The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate and currency risks. 
 The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its floating-rate debt. To manage this risk the Group uses caps or swaps with first-class counterparties.
 Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies.
 The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health. 

10.4.2. **INTEREST RATE RISK**

###### The Group used caps and swaps in 2020 to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives are qualified as cash flow hedging instruments.
 Hedging is considered to be effective if the Euribor fixing on the hedged loan is strictly equivalent to the fixing of the hedging instrument.
 In 2019, the Group also used caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives, which were designated as cash flow hedging instruments, are shown in the table below.

10.4.3. **CURRENCY RISK**

###### The Group's exposure to currency risk is very limited as most of its business is conducted in Europe. 
 There were no currency hedging commitments at 31 December 2019 or 31 December 2020.
 Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk the latter had no material impact on income (as in 2019).

10.4.4. **CREDIT RISK**

###### Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group. 
 Deposits and guarantees
 The credit risk on deposits and guarantees is considered to be limited.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 With regard to cash and cash equivalents, the credit risk is considered to be limited insofar as:

 • they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day- to-day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles.

 • they are invested exclusively in money market instruments.
 Trade receivables
 Trade receivables are the amounts owed by franchisees. 
 They may be impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. Indicators of incurred losses include, for example, significant financial difficulties of a franchisee or a breach of the franchise agreement (e.g. payment is past due more than x days). These receivables deemed to be at risk are fully impaired if there are indicators of incurred credit loss. The provision for such losses totaled €6.9 million at 31 December 2020, vs. €3.3 million at 31 December 2019. The main change between 2019 and 2020 is attributable to an assessment of the risk of non-recovery of €2.7 million of the business lease fees for March 2020, the payment dates for which were deferred throughout 2021.
 A statistics-based provision is made for receivables that are not impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. This statistical provision is based on the history of credit losses actually incurred over the past ten years. At 31 December 2020, this provision was €64 thousand, vs. €78 thousand at 31 December 2019.
 Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables.

10.4.5. **LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE**

###### The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity.


-----

###### The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short-term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities.

 Current debt includes the €80 million government-guaranteed "PGE" loan (see Note 10.2). However, the Group plans to allow this loan to be automatically extended beyond its initial 12-month term and to repay it when the Quick business is disposed of (see Note 4.3). The Group therefore believes that it has sufficient resources to cover the €214 million in current liabilities, which include the 80 million PGE loan that will immediately fall due if the Quick business is sold.

###### Financial covenants

 The Group is subject to the following financial covenant at the balance sheet date.


-----

###### As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding amount of the RCF line was 20 million euros.  Although the Consolidated net debt / Consolidated EBITDA ratio was exceeded at December 31, 2020, since less than 35% of the credit line was used, the Group is not required to comply with this ratio.

 10.5. Off-balance sheet commitments given as collateral for loans

 The Group has made the following off-balance sheet commitments to provide collateral for the €625 million in bonds issued in 2017: - Pledging of bank accounts - Pledging of intra-group receivables - Pledging of Burger King France's receivables on Bertrand Holding under the cash management agreement - Pledging of shares held in Financières Quick, BKQ Services, France Quick, Burger King Construction, Burger King Restauration.

 In 2019, the following off-balance sheet commitments were provided to provide collateral for new credit lines:  - Letter of intent to Crédit Mutuel on behalf of Agaquick - Pledging of a France Quick business to BNP.

#### 11. INCOME TAX

###### 11.1. Income tax expense


###### Corporate income tax includes current and deferred taxes and the impact of changes in tax rates. Income taxes are recognized in income (except when recorded in other comprehensive income), directly in equity or during business combinations.

 After examining the applicable legislation, the Group considers that the CVAE "business added-value tax" is an income tax as defined under IAS 12.2 ("Income Tax Payable on Taxable Profits").

-----

- The tax charge reconciliation (or "tax proof") for 2019 was restated to comply with the IFRIC standard of December
2019 (see Note 3.6).

###### (1) The other tax effects on permanent differences mainly pertain to non-deductible financial expenses, the RSU plan expenses, and the reversal of negative goodwill through income.

 11.2. Deferred tax assets and liabilities

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, on the basis of the tax rates (and tax regulations) that were adopted or substantially adopted at the balance sheet date.

 Deferred tax assets are recognized if the temporary difference is likely to reverse in the foreseeable future and there is likely to be a taxable profit to which the temporary difference may be applied.

###### The other changes are attributable to deferred taxes on regulated provisions, and to the effect of rate changes. 

 Deferred tax assets were not recognized since it is not certain that the Group will have future taxable profits against which these tax assets can be applied. At 31 December 2020, the amount of these unrecognized deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards totaled €87.4 million, vs. €84.6 million at 31 December 2019. Tax losses for which no deferred tax has been recognized can be carried forward indefinitely.

#### 12. EQUIT Y


###### Share capital


###### Preference shares are classified as equity because they pay discretionary dividends, are subject to no redemption obligation in cash or a financial asset, and do not require settlement in a variable number of the Group's equity instruments.  Discretionary dividend distributions are charged directly to equity when approved by a general assembly of shareholders.


###### Share capital totaled €39,161,544 at 31 December 2020, vs. €39,161,541.78 at 31 December 2019, for an increase of €2.22. This increase was effected by issuing 222 new ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 each. This decision was approved by the Chairman on 1 October 2020.

 Although this decision modified the distribution of share capital, it did not affect its amount. At 31 December 2020, Burger King France's share capital consisted of:
 • 587,700 ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 (vs. 587 478 shares with a value of €0.01 at 31 December 2019)
 • 566,700 Class A preference shares with a par value of €0.01 (vs. 566,700 shares with a par value of €0.01 at 31 December 2019)
 • 783 Class B preference shares with a par value of €50 thousand (vs. 783 shares with a par value of €50 thousand at 31 December 2019).

 Share premium

 The share premium totaled €163.3 million at 31 December 2020, as in 2019.

##### Statutory auditors’ report  on the consolidated financial statements

For the year ended December 31, 2020

To the annual general meeting of Burger King France S.A.S.,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Burger King France S.A.S. (the
“Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and of the results
of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

**_Audit Framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory _Auditors’_
_Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the
french Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de
déontologie) for statutory auditors’ rules applicable to us, for the period from January 1, 2020 to
the date of our report.

**Emphasis of Matter**

We draw attention to the following matter described in Note 3.6 to the consolidated financial
statements relating to the “Impacts of the application of IFRS IC decision issued on December
16, 2019”. This note highlights the impacts of the application of this decision clarifying the
determination of lease terms within the scope of IFRS 16 standard. The impacts related to this
change in accounting policy has been restated retrospectively on the first-time application of
IFRS 16, January 1, 2019. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Justification of Assessments**

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period
have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the
exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had
numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and
have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel
restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal
organization and the performance of the audits.

It is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles
L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the
justification of our assessments, we inform you of the matters that, in our professional judgment,
were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current
period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

As stated in Note 8.4 to the consolidated financial statements, “Impairment of intangible
assets”,  goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are subject to impairment tests. We have
analyzed the methods of implementation of the impairment tests, as well as the cash flow
forecasts and assumptions used to perform impairment tests, and we have assessed the
appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 8.4.

As stated in Note 3.6 to the consolidated financial statements, “Impacts of the application of
IFRS IC decision issued on December 16, 2019”, the Company applied the IFRS IC decision
issued on December 16, 2019 and took into account the position statement published by the
French accouting standards body (Autorité des Normes Comptables - ANC) on July 3, 2020, to
retrospectively determine, as of 1 January 2019, the IFRS 16 lease terms of “3/6/9”- type
French commercial leases.
The consolidated financial statements of 2019 have been restated consequently to this decision.

We have obtained an understanding of the procedures implemented by the Company to identify
the leases in the scope of this decision.
We have assessed the relevance of the criteria considered by the management to determine
the residual lease term and, for a sample of contracts, reconciled the data collected to
determine the residual lease term with underlying agreements, recalculated the amounts of the
right-of-use assets and the lease commitments as re-measured and recognized by the
Company as at January 1, 2019, and assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note
3.6 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Specific Verifications**

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group information given in the
management report of the President.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the**
**Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to
liquidate the Company or to cease operations.


The consolidated financial statements were approved by the President.

**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our
statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of
management of the affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France,
the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

 - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

 - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.

 - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated
financial statements.

 - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a
material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not
provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

 - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses
whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner
that achieves fair presentation.

 - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion
expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

#### 2. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2019 AND POST-BALANCE SHEET
###### EVENTS

 2.1. Significant events of 2019

 2019 was marked by the following significant events.

 Contributions to the scope of discontinued operations

 In order to prepare for the disposal of discontinued operations, in 2019 the Group continued its legal and real estate reorganization begun in 2018, by contributing, transfering or selling goodwill, construction leases, commercial leases and all related PPE investments to the above-mentioned discontinued scope of operations, which concerns 54 restaurants (See Note 4.3). 

 Business development

 After opening 25 restaurants in 2018 (including 24 under the Burger King® brand) and converting 63 restaurants previously operated under the Quick® brand to the Burger King® brand, the Group continued to expand in 2019 with:
 • The opening of 25 new restaurants, including 22 operated under the Burger King® brand
 • The conversion to the Burger King® brand of 29 restaurants formerly operating under the Quick® brand. A significant portion of the investments for this development was assumed by the lessors or supported by the Group's franchisees, thus limiting the Group's remaining net investment.

 System-wide sales

 The Group's system-wide sales totaled €1.36 billion at 31 December 2019, of which €1.13 billion was from continuing operations (€121 million more than the previous year) and €227 million from discontinued operations (for a year- on-year increase €24 million). The increase in the Group's system-wide sales is mainly attributable to:
 • The opening of 25 new restaurants and the positive impact of the conversion of 29 Quick® restaurants to the Burger King® brand
 • The full-year effect of the restaurant openings and conversions to the Burger King® brand of Quick® restaurants completed in 2018
 • The good performance of Quick® restaurants on a like-for-like basis in 2019.

 Acquisitions

 During the year, the Group acquired interests in seven new companies that operate nine Burger King® restaurants (See Notes 4.2 and 4.4).

 Outsourcing of the purchasing and logistics of Quick® restaurants

 During 2019, the Group outsourced the purchasing and logistics activities of its chain of Quick restaurants in mainland France. These activities were previously carried out directly by the Group via its dedicated subsidiary "Logirest".


-----

###### This outsourcing results in a decrease in sales and franchise revenues (see Note 6.1) and a decrease in the cost of supplies and merchandise (see Note 6.2).  

 2.2. Post-balance sheet events

 After 2020 got off to a start that was broadly in line with its business plan, the Group saw its system-wide sales drop in early March as a result of the Covid-19 health crisis.

 Following the measures decided by the French government to prevent the spread of the Covid virus, and in particular the executive orders of March 14 and 15, 2020 and the decree and order of March 16, 2020, all of the Group's restaurants are currently closed.

 In terms of financial management, the Group, which had available cash of 105 million euros at the end of February 2020 and an unused credit line of 60 million euros, has decided to draw 100% of this credit line and to apply for the government's support measures, which include deferred payment of social security and tax charges.

 In order to cope with the lack of sales as of 15 March over a period of several weeks, the Group undertook various cost-reduction and investment measures, including in particular the implementation of short-time work schedules for employees.  

 Giving this unprecedented context and the absence of clear information on the pandemic's expected magnitude and duration, the Group is not in a position to provide specific information on the consequences these events may have on its earnings and cash position.

#### 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION

###### 3.1. Declaration of conformity

 The consolidated financial statements of the Burger King France Group for 2019 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the IASB as adopted mandatorily in the European Union at 31 December 2019, and with SIC and IFRIC interpretations thereof.  All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-andsupplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adopting-internationalaccounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric ure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adopting-internationalaccounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric

###### 3.2. Changes in the accounting framework

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2019

 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2019 are:

 • IFRS 16 – Leases: see Note 3.6 and 8.3.2

 • Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

 • IFRIC Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

 • Amendments to IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures

 • Amendments to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

 • IFRS annual improvements – 2015-2017 cycle.

 Apart from IFRS 16 (the effects of which are explained in Notes 3.6 and 8.3.2), the other standards had no impact on the Group's accounts. In particular, the Group has no significant tax uncertainties within the scope of IFRIC 23.

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2020

 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2020:

 - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Materiality - Amendment of references in the standards to the conceptual framework - Amendments to IFRS 3 – Definition of a business.

 At the time of this publication, the Group does not expect these new standards to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.


-----

###### 3.3. Use of estimates and judgments

 In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements.

 The Group's management makes these estimates and assessments on an ongoing basis, based on past experience and various factors it considers to be reasonable.

 Unexpected changes in events and circumstances, and particularly in the economic environment of the Group's business activity, may cause its financial results to differ from these estimates. 

 The most significant estimates and judgments that the management of Burger King France Group has made in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant impact on its financial statements mainly have to do with:
 • Impairment tests on fixed assets and goodwill (Note 8.4)
 • The measurement of rights of use and lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16 (Notes 3.6 and 8.3.2)
 • The recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 11.2).

 3.4. Methods used to translate foreign currency transactions

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's functional currency. Amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand euros, unless otherwise stated. 

 Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement.

 3.5. Basis of assessment

 The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivatives which are measured at fair value.

 3.6. Effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 16

3.6.1. **FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IFRS 16**

###### The Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases for the first time on 1 January 2019. 

 On 13 January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 - Leases, which was adopted by the European Union on 31 October 2017. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations. It eliminates, for lessees, the different accounting treatments that previously applied to operating and finance leases.

 Lessees are required to recognize all leases (with some exceptions) in a way that is largely similar to the method required for finance leases under IAS 17, i.e. recognizing as an asset the right to use the underlying leased asset, and as a lease liability the obligation to pay lease payments over the lease term.


-----

###### However, the standard provides for exemptions for leases of 12 months or less an leases for low-value assets. The Group has used these two exemptions. 

 The Group has observed IFRS 16 in accordance with the simplified retrospective method, which recommends recording the cumulative effect of the adoption of IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the balance of reserves at 1 January 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is therefore presented, as previously, in accordance with the principles of IAS 17 and its interpretations. The resulting changes to accounting policies are explained in detail below.

 The Group presents the "rights of use" asset in the statement of financial position under property, plant and equipment on the same line as the underlying asset of the same nature that it owns in full, and presents lease liabilities on the "current/non-current lease liabilities" lines of "current/non-current financial liabilities". 

3.6.2. **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

###### Under IFRS 16, a contract or part of a contract is or contains a lease if it grants the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 

 The Group recognizes a "right-of-use" asset and a lease liability at the inception of the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, with possible adjustment to account for certain revaluations of the lease liability. 

 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments due but not yet paid at the start date of the contract. The discount rate used corresponds to the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if this cannot be easily determined, the marginal borrowing rate (based on the lending term and not the maturity date). The Group uses the marginal borrowing rate as the discount rate.

 The lease liability is then increased by the interest expense and reduced by the amount of the lease payments. It is remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments subsequent to a change in an index or rate or to a re- estimation of the amount payable under a residual value guarantee, or in the event of a revaluation of the exercise of a purchase option or the extension or non-exercise of a termination option (in which case said payments becomes reasonably certain). 

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on rights of use and lease liabilities, considering that tax deductions on lease payments are attributable to the liability and then offset.

 On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC issued its final decision on the assessment of lease terms and depreciation periods for immovable fixtures and fittings, deeming it unnecessary to amend IFRS 16 to clarify the concept of "enforceable period".  With this decision, the Committee seeks to clarify the method used to determine the lease term, since it does not accept the legal approach of determining the period during which a lease is enforceable solely on the basis of the terms of the lease agreement. The Committee thus considers that a lease remains enforceable for as long as the lessee or the lessor would suffer a significant loss if the lease were terminated. Accordingly, even in the absence of an option that enables the lessee to extend a lease at its discretion, the reasonably certain term of the lease must be assessed to determine the corresponding lease liability and the value of the right of use. In the Committee's view, the concept of "loss" should be considered broadly and not limited to contractual or monetary penalties.  


-----

###### With regard to the depreciation period for immovable fittings and fixtures, the Committee notes that: - The term of a lease should be taken into account when determining the depreciation period of the fittings and fixtures - The existence of fixtures or fittings that are not fully depreciated and which would have to be abandoned and removed if the lease is terminated is one example of a loss to be considered when determining the lease's enforceable period.

 The application of this decision should not have a significant impact on the Group.

 LEASE PREMIUMS

 A lease premium is inseparable from the lease itself since the lessee could not have entered into the lease agreement without incurring the cost of the lease premium and would not have incurred that cost if it had not been able to enter into the lease agreement. Therefore, the lease premium is a direct cost initially incurred by the Group as lessee that is included in the initial measurement of the right of use. 

 It was considered that the right of use is composed of the following two significant and distinct elements, which need to be amortized separately as their future economic benefits are consumed at different rates:

 - the lease premium

 - the other leasehold interests that constitute the right of use.

 For the lease premium, an analysis of the relevant restaurants showed that in the vast majority of cases the restaurant's location and "premium" characteristics ensured that the lease premium's value at the end of the lease would be at least equivalent to its current value. Accordingly, this component was not amortized.

 The other components of the right of use are amortized over the useful life of the right of use, which is the lease term. 

3.6.3. **TRANSITIONAL ACCOUNTING TREATMENT**

###### At the date of the transition, i.e. 1 January 2019, the lease liability for leases classified as operating leases under IAS 17 was measured at the value of the remaining lease payments discounted at the marginal euro borrowing rate of the French subsidiaries and based on the remaining lease terms and not on the initial lease terms. 

 Right-of-use assets are valued at the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid and outstanding lease payments on the balance sheet and any benefits granted by the lessors.


-----

###### For reasons of simplification, the Group has observed the following methods and options:

 • The option not to recognize a "right-of-use" asset or a lease liability for leases with a residual term of less than 12 months

 • The option of not recognizing a "right-of-use" asset or a lease liability for leased assets worth less than five thousand euros

 • A term of six months is used for automatically renewed leases

 • The initial direct costs of the valuation of the "right-of-use" asset at the date of the standard's first application (excluding lease premiums that were already capitalized at 1 January 2019) were not included, except for the entry fees paid to lessors when leases were signed

 • The Group uses its past experience to determine the term of leases that include extension or termination options

 • Discount rates were calculated using the residual term at 1 January 2019

 • A single discount rate was used for portfolios of leases with similar characteristics.

 The Group's main leases are for premises (commercial leases and construction leases), vehicles and IT equipment. 

 The terms of real property leases and construction leases were determined as follows:
 • For 12-year leases with waiver of the right to terminate after each three-year period (the vast majority of leases), the term used is based on the non-cancellable 12-year term.
 • For 12-year leases with a 12-year renewal commitment, the term used is based on the renewed term of 24 years
 • For 3, 6 and 9 year leases without waiver of the three-year termination option, the term used is based on the 9-year term, provided there is no intention to terminate the lease.
 • For 40-year construction leases, the term is based on the 40-year non-cancellable term.

 These payments on these leases are fixed and may or may not be indexed.

 For IT equipment and vehicles, lease terms are generally from two to four years. These payments on these leases are fixed and may or may not be indexed.

 The Group leases, as lessee, a number of premises that previously qualified as finance leases under IAS 17. For these leases, the carrying amounts of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at 1 January 2019 were determined to be those of the underlying leased asset and the lease liability, which were calculated in accordance with IAS 17 just before that date.

###### 3.7. Restatements of the comparative period 

 The comparative income statement of 2018 has been restated following the classification of Quick's business activities, which are to be disposed of as discontinued operations (see Note 4.3).

 The Group has also undertaken a project to improve the relevance and readability of its consolidated financial statements, which resulted in the following reclassifications:

 • On the Statement of Financial Position: o "Tax receivables excluding corporate income tax", "Financial receivables and other current assets" and "Other financial receivables" at 31 December 2018 were grouped together under "Other current assets". o "Other tax liabilities", "Payroll and social security liabilities" and "Other current liabilities" at 31 December 2018 were combined under "Other current liabilities". o Derivatives recorded under "Other non-current liabilities" at 31 December 2018 were reclassified to "Non-current financial liabilities". o "Other tax receivables" and "Other tax payables" at 31 December 2018 were restated to reflect the liquidation of VAT between assets and liabilities. o Prepaid expenses and deferred income on entrance fees at 31 December 2018 were restated to correct the allocation between current and non-current.
 • On the Income Statement: o The network entry fees and franchise entry fees were reclassified from "Other operating income and expenses" to "Sales and franchise income". o The billing of certain services to partners outside the Group were reclassified from "Other head- office income and expenses" to "Sales and franchise income".
 • In the cash flow statement, interest received was reclassified from "from financing" to "from investment".

 Certain item headings were also clarified and more information was added to the notes to the financial statements.

#### 4. CONSOLIDATION SCOPE

###### 4.1. Accounting principles observed for the scope of consolidation


###### Consolidation of subsidiaries


###### A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. The Group controls a company when it is exposed to, or is entitled to, variable returns from its relationship with the company and may have an impact on these returns through its control over the company. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date that such control is initially obtained and until it ceases.


###### Equity method of accounting for joint ventures


###### A joint venture is a form of partnership that gives the Group joint control over a company and rights to the net assets of the joint venture, but no rights to its assets or obligations in respect of its liabilities. Burger King France uses the equity method to account for its joint ventures.


###### 4.2. Business combinations


###### Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities are generally recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date.


###### Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any interest previously held in the acquiree) plus the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognized (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Non- controlling interests are measured when control is gained, either pro rata to the identifiable net assets or at fair value, depending on the option selected.


###### When the difference thus determined is negative, and after the various components are remeasured, it can be immediately taken to income, in "other non-recurring income and expenses".


###### Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment loss. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement and are irreversible.

###### The cash flows arising from these acquisitions are shown below.

_In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019

Cash consideration (2 592)
Cash and cash equivalents 4 372
Acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash 1 780

###### A total of €1,730 thousand was recognized in the Cash Flow Statement for "Acquisitions of subsidiaries, net of cash". The difference of €50 thousand is attributable to the adjustment of the acquisition price of the subsidiaries acquired in 2018, which required the adjustment of goodwill.

 Acquisition expenses are recorded in "Other non-current operating expenses". No significant costs were recognized in 2019. 

 From the date of their acquisition to 31 December 2019, these companies contributed €17.1 million to sales and franchise income and €0.8 million to profit.

 If these acquisitions had been made on 1 January 2019, the Group's consolidated sales and franchise income would have been €496.4 million and its annual profit €8.9 million. 


-----

###### 4.3. Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities held for sale


###### A non-current asset or a group of associated assets and liabilities is considered to be held for sale in the following cases, in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”:

 • the asset or group is available for immediate sale in its present condition
 • its sale is highly likely, which is the case when management has undertaken efforts to sell the asset or
 group and to find a buyer at a reasonable price and has committed to sell it within one year. Non-current assets, groups of assets or businesses held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value (i.e. the estimated selling price), net of disposal costs. They are presented on a separate line on the balance sheet and are no longer depreciated or amortized. Joint ventures are no longer accounted for using the equity method.

 A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's operations which has business activities and cash flows that are clearly distinct from those of the rest of the Group, and which:

 • represents a major and distinct line of business or geographic area
 • is part of a coordinated plan to divest a major and distinct line of business or geographic area, or
 • is a subsidiary acquired exclusively to be resold.

 The classification takes place on the date of disposal or earlier if the activity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.

 When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had met the criteria of a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period.


###### In order to focus on the development of the Burger King brand in France, in 2019, the Group reorganized Quick's business activities into a distinct group of companies to facilitate their sale. 

 In view of this reorganization and the steps already taken, the Group considers that the sale of this business is very likely within the next twelve months.

###### The changes in the scope of consolidation in 2019 are described in Note 4.2 "Change in the scope of consolidation".  The companies accounted for by the equity method are joint ventures of immaterial importance. The Group has fully consolidated its 50% interest in the Agaquick sub-group since it considers that it controls Agaquick. 


-----

###### 4.5. Non-controlling interests

 Non-controlling interests are initially measured either at their fair value or at the pro rata share of the net identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date. Changes in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

 The non-controlling interests are:
 • The sub-group consisting of Agaquick SAS and its subsidiaries, in which the Group has a 50% stake
 • BK Expansion, 84.44% of which is owned by the Group
 • BK Développement, 73.12% of which is owned by the Group
 • Flagship, 50.71% of which is owned by the Group
 • BK Croissance and BK Exploitation, of which the Group holds 3.21%
 • SL2R and its subsidiary ADFR, 55.08% of which is owned by the Group
 • SN2R and its subsidiary Houdemont, 76.91% of which is owned by the Group.

 As at 31 December 2018, only the investment in the Agaquick sub-group was material for the Group at 31 December 2019. The following table presents the key financial figures of this wholly owned sub-group before intra-group eliminations.

#### 5. SEGMENT INFORMATION


###### Under IFRS 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity:



###### • that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses
 • whose operational results are regularly monitored by the chief operating decision maker
 • for which separate financial information is available.

 The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") is its Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

 The Group's business activity, which constitutes a single operating segment, is operating restaurants in France under franchise agreements or which it owns.  Until 31 December 2018, sales, ordinary operating income and EBITDA were broken down between franchised restaurants, company-owned restaurants and "other activities", which consisted of head-office support services and logistics services provided to all restaurants. However, separate data for these activities are no longer provided since they do not constitute distinct operating segments. The CODM thus allocates resources and monitors the Group's performance on the basis of more general information that is presented in accordance with:
 • the Group's management structure, which has no separate departments for company-owned and franchised restaurants, and with the pooling of support services; and
 • the internal and external reporting systems, which mainly present financial information in aggregate form.

 Note 6.1 provides a breakdown of revenue by type of product and service, with a distinction between merchandise sales by company-owned restaurants and income from franchise agreements.  All revenue is realized in France. No individual customer is of significant size.


-----

#### 6. OPERATIONS

###### 6.1. Sales and franchise revenues


###### Sales and franchise revenues consist of:

 • the sales of foodservice products and services through company-operated restaurants within the scope of
 IFRS 15
 • brand royalties and other income paid by franchisees within the scope of IFRS 15
 • sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees
 • entry fees and other sales, which include network access fees and entry fees invoiced to franchisees and
 revenue from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees.

Note Amount % Amount %

Sales to consumers 6.1.1 290 406 59% 319 567 61%

Entry fees and other sales 6.1.4 15 874 3% 20 523 4%

Sales and franchise revenues 490 546 100% 528 059 100%

###### * Sales and franchise revenues were restated in preparation for the planned sale of Quick's activities classified as discontinued operations (IFRS 5) as explained in Note 4.3.

6.1.1. **CONSUMER SALES**


###### Revenue from sales to consumers includes the revenue from the sale of hamburgers and other food products at the Group's company-owned restaurants and of related catering services.

 Sales revenue is recognized when the control of the products sold (the "merchandise") is transferred to the customer, i.e. when payment is made at the cash register for sales to consumers in company-operated restaurants.

 Revenue is valued net of returns, rebates, trade discounts and quantity discounts.


###### Sales to consumers amounted to €290.4 million in 2019, compared to €319.6 million in 2018, for a decrease of €29.2 million. This decrease is mainly attributable to the reduction in the number of restaurants the Group operates directly as a result of their closure or sale, or their operation under new franchise agreements (27 restaurants). This decrease was partially offset by new restaurants the Group operates directly (11 restaurants).


-----

6.1.2. **ROYALTIES AND OTHER CHARGES TO FRANCHISEES**


###### The various types of franchise agreements are: full franchise, shared franchise, business lease, and business lease with investment. The percentage paid depends on the type of agreement. Royalties and other charges to franchisees (excluding rent) comprise:

 • the royalties received from franchisees for the use of the Burger King® and Quick® brands.

 • the franchisees' contribution to the national advertising budget

 • Business lease fees received from the leasing of Group-owned businesses.

 Brand royalties

 Brand royalties are billed monthly to franchisees and are a contractual percentage of their revenue. These royalties are recognized when the franchise revenue is earned, in accordance with the royalty exemption provided for under IFRS 15, with the exception of annual guaranteed minimums which are recognized on a straight-line basis.

 National advertising charges 

 Franchisees are billed monthly for their contribution to the national advertising budget, which is a percentage of the franchise's revenue. It is recorded when this revenue is earned, as it is considered that national advertising activities do not apply to any service that is distinct from the license to use the brand and the know-how.

 Business lease royalties

 As lessor, Burger King France Group has entered into real property leases and business leases (with or without investment) with its franchisees.

 The term of business leases is 9+9 years for Burger King® restaurants, and from 3 to 12 years for Quick restaurants.

 The royalties paid under these leases are a contractual percentage of the franchise revenue and are invoiced in consideration of the use of the business assets, the occupation of the premises and the leasehold interest.

 These business leases are operating leases for the lessor under IFRS 16.

 Lease payments are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.


###### The Group had 304 franchised restaurants at 31 December 2019, vs. 279 at 31 December 2018.

 The total transaction price for services that were not fully provided at the balance sheet date is immaterial.


-----

###### Franchise royalties totaled €176.7 million in 2019, which is €41.7 million more than in 2018 (€135.0 million). This increase is mainly due to (i) the transfer of 22 restaurants from Group-operated to franchised, and (ii) the opening of 22 restaurants operated by franchisees. This increase of 44 restaurants was partially offset by (iii) the Group's takeover of 9 restaurants and (iv) the definitive closure or disposal of 7 restaurants operated under franchise agreements.

 The table below shows future minimum lease payment receivables under non-cancellable operating leases, broken down by residual lease term:

- The total amount of minimum payment receivables was restated in view of the planned sale of Quick activities classified as
discontinued operations (IFRS 5) as explained in Note 4.3.

6.1.3. **SALES OF MERCHANDISE AND EQUIPMENT TO FRANCHISES**


###### Merchandise and equipment are sold to Quick franchisees by the Group's subsidiary Logirest France.

 Revenue from the sale of merchandise and equipment is recognized when their control is transferred to the franchisee, which is the invoice date.


###### Sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees totaled €7.5 million in 2019 vs. €53.0 million in 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to the Group's outsourcing of its purchasing and logistics activities for Quick® restaurants (see Significant events of 2019).


-----

6.1.4. **ENTRY FEES AND OTHER SALES**


###### Network entry and franchise entry fees.

 Network entry and franchise entry fees are charged to franchisees in consideration of the transfer of know-how, the use of the brand, territorial exclusivity and assistance in opening a restaurant.

 They are invoiced at the start of the contract. As with brand royalties, they are considered to be remuneration for the license to use the trademark and know-how, and not remuneration for distinct services.

 As this is a "variable license" within the meaning of IFRS 15, this income is recognized over the term of the franchise agreement, and on a straight-line basis, since it is considered that the Group's services as a franchisor are provided uniformly over the term of the agreement.

 Fees invoiced at the start of the contract that have not yet been recognized in "Sales and franchise income" are recognized in current and non-current deferred income.

 Other revenue

 Other revenue consist mainly of the from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees.


Other sales 10 768 8 288

Total 15 874 20 523

###### Deferred income from network and franchise entry fees is included in "Other non-current liabilities" (see Note 6.8) and "Other current liabilities" (see Note 6.5.5). It is broken down in the following table:

###### 6.2. Gross and operating profit and margin


###### Cost of sales is the cost of supplies and merchandise and of restaurant personnel.

 • The cost of supplies and merchandise is the cost of the raw materials and merchandise required to make
 the finished products sold to consumers (see Note 6.1.1) and the cost of the raw materials, merchandise and equipment the Group sells to franchisees (see Note 6.1.3).
 • Restaurant personnel costs include salaries, the employer's social security charges, and the benefits paid
 to Group employees whose work is directly related to the selling of products to consumers (see Note 6.1.1)

 Occupancy and operating costs mainly include the costs of energy, maintenance, security, leases (until 31 December 2018), and taxes (business tax, property tax, etc.). Depreciation corresponds to the depreciation or amortization of restaurant assets and rights of use as of 1 January 2019.

- The profit from operations has been restated to take into account the planned sale of Quick activities classified as discontinued
operations (IFRS 5) as explained in Note 4.3.

###### The change in operating and occupancy costs expenses and in depreciation and amortization compared to 2018 is mainly attributable to the application of the new IFRS 16 standard, the impacts of which on the 2019 operating margin are presented in Note 3.6.4.2.


-----

###### 6.3. Ordinary operating income


###### Ordinary operating income is composed of the following items:

 • The operating profit (see Note 6.2)
 • Selling expenses, which are the advertising and marketing expenses the Group incurs for the restaurants
 it operates and for those operating under a franchise agreement, for which national advertising fees are charged (see Note 6.1.2)
 • Burger King brand royalties paid to Burger King Corporation
 • Restaurant opening costs include all of the costs incurred prior to the opening of a restaurant and which
 are necessary for its opening, such as personnel expenses while staff is being trained, staff recruitment costs, lease payments, the cost of advertising the restaurant opening, and the initial purchase of minor non-depreciable items that are needed to operate the restaurant.
 • Other ordinary operating income and expenses, which are mainly:
 o Capital gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets required to set up franchised operations or

###### 6.5. Working capital requirement

6.5.1. **INVENTORIES**


###### Inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or net realizable value.


###### The Group's inventories consist of supplies, equipment and food products.

 They are recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price plus customs duties, other non-recoverable taxes, and the costs of transportation and handling incurred in bringing inventory items to their storage site.


###### Equipment inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method.


###### The food products inventory is valued using the FIFO method (First in, First Out) given the rapid turnover of this inventory and the rules that apply to its management.

###### The decrease in inventories of supplies and merchandise at Logirest is attributable to the outsourcing of Logirest's activities in 2019 (see Significant events of the year).


-----

6.5.2. **TRADE RECEIVABLES**


###### Trade and other operating receivables are initially recognized at their fair value, which is generally their nominal value. There are no trade receivables that are pledged or insured.

 In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group uses the simplified method to measure trade receivables and recognizes expected credit losses over the life of the receivable. Expected credit losses are estimated using an allowance matrix that is based on historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for specific factors relating to the creditor, current general economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions that are obtainable at the balance sheet date without incurring undue cost or effort.


_In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Change

Trade receivables 45 257 51 594 (6 337)

Total 27 384 53 558 (26 174 )

- Tax assets and other current assets were restated subsequent to the reclassifications explained in Note 3.7.

###### Tax receivables (other than on income tax) are mainly on deductible VAT.

 Prepaid expenses consist mainly of the short-term portion of network entry fees, which are spread over the term of the master franchise agreement. 


-----

###### The frozen cash is the France Quick cash attached at the request of a former international master franchisee with whom France Quick had a legal dispute. The change recognized in 2019 reflects the end of this dispute (see Note 9).

6.5.4. **TRADE PAYABLES**


###### Trade payables are initially recognized at their fair value, which is generally their nominal value.


6.5.5. **OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES**

Total 52 831 58 302 (5 471 )

- Other current liabilities have been restated following the reclassifications explained in Note 3.7.

###### Deferred income includes rent received in advance on certain subleases or leases to franchisees and the short-term portion of entry fees spread over the term of the franchise agreement.

6.5.6. **CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL**

###### The change in the working capital requirement breaks down as follows:

_In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018


Effect of change in inventories 6 590 4 415
Effect of change in trade receivables and other current assets 18 653 5 339
Effect of change in trade payables and other liabilities (25 488) (30 022)

Total (245 ) (20 268 )

###### The positive impact of the change in inventories of €2.2 million recognized in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year is mainly attributable to the outsourcing of the Quick purchasing and logistics business in 2019 as described in the "Significant events of the year" section.

 The positive impact of the change in trade receivables of €13.3 million in 2019 vs. 2018 is mainly attributable to:
 - The release of funds in a France Quick bank account which had been attached at the request of one of its former master franchisees.


-----

###### - The discontinuation of the recognition of trade receivables on sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees following the Group's outsourcing of the Quick purchasing and logistics activity in 2019, as described in the "Significant events of the year " section. - The recovery of VAT receivables recorded at the end of the previous financial year following the legal and real property reorganization undertaken to prepare for the disposal of discontinued operations (see the "Significant events of the year" section)

 The improvement in the impact of the change in trade payables and other current liabilities of €4.5 million is due to:
 - The decrease in trade payables of the Quick purchasing and logistics business in 2019 following its outsourcing, as described in the "Significant events of the year" section - The decrease in trade payables and social security liabilities for restaurants operated directly by the Group, mainly as a result of the franchising of 21 restaurants in 2019 (see Note 6.1.1).

 6.6. Non-current financial assets


###### Loans and guarantees pertain mainly to the Group's operating leases as lessee. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.

 The Group uses caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives are measured at fair value. The method used to recognize changes in their fair value depends on whether there is a documented hedging relationship as defined in IFRS 9:

 • in the absence of a hedging relationship, changes in fair value are taken to income
 • if there is a documented relationship for hedging cash flows, the change in the fair value of the effective
 portion of the hedging derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income while that of the ineffective portion is directly taken to the income statement.

 However, the time value of the options is recognized separately as a hedging cost. It is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve within equity. It is recycled to the income statement over the term of the hedge.


###### Non-current financial assets consist of the following:

#### 7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

###### 7.1. Workforce

 The workforce includes employees employed under fixed-term and permanent contracts.

 The Group's average full-time equivalent headcount was 3,448 in 2019, vs. 4,620 in 2018.

 7.2. Personnel expenses


###### Personnel expenses are recognized as services are provided.

 Until 31 December 2018, the CICE employment tax credit was recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses and was allocated between the various departments. The 2018 Finance Act abolished the CICE tax credit as of 1 January 2019. At that date, the CICE was replaced by a permanent reduction in employer social security charges.


###### The table below shows personnel expenses recognized in ordinary operating income.

_In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018

Head office staff salaries and social-security charges (26 897) (28 037)

Total personnel expenses (125 610 ) (137 164 )

###### The personnel expenses of restaurant staff are recorded under "cost of sales", while those of head office staff are recorded under "general and administrative expenses".

 Other personnel expenses are mainly travel and sundry restaurant staff expenses.

 From January 1 to 31 December 2018, all of the income from the CICE tax credit was invested in the opening and conversion of Burger King® restaurants in accordance with the QuickN'King 2020 plan.


-----

###### 7.3. Employee benefits

 The Group's employees receive short-term benefits (paid leave, sick leave, etc.), post-employment benefits based on defined contributions (social security plans and ARRCO/AGIRC supplementary pension plans) and on defined benefits (lump-sum retirement payments), as well as other long-term benefits (length-of-service and long-service bonuses).

Other long-term employee benefits 151 59

Total 3 535 3 098

7.3.1. **LUMP-SUM RETIREMENT PAYMENTS**


###### French law provides for the payment of a lump-sum retirement benefit that is a function of the employees' length of service with the Group and his or her salary at the time of retirement.

 The Group's obligation in respect of this benefit is valued annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Revaluations of the liability (actuarial gains and losses) are recognized in other comprehensive income. The service cost is recognized as an operating expense, in "general and administrative expenses", while the associated interest expense is recognized as a financial expense.


###### Main assumptions used for the calculation of defined benefit plans

7.3.2. **OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

###### At 31 December 2019, the Group recognized €151 thousand for length-of-service bonuses and long-service awards (vs. €59 thousand in 2018).

 7.4. Share-based compensation


###### The fair value of performance shares granted to employees is recognized in income in "other non-current expenses" over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity.

 This fair value was determined using an EBITDA-multiple model, the terms of vesting plans, the market data available at the grant date and the assumptions of the Group’s management.


###### For its RSU plan, implemented in 2018, the Group recognized an expense of €2.7 million in 2019, vs. €0.9 million in 2018.

 7.5. Compensation of key management personnel (related parties)

 In 2019, key executives received compensation of €3.1 million, compared to €3.4 million in 2018. 

 This compensation includes the salaries of these executives, benefits in kind, contributions to defined contribution post-employment benefit plans and the expense of defined benefit post-employment plan. These executives are also entitled to RSU (see Note 7.4).


-----

#### 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PPE

###### 8.1. Goodwill

 Goodwill is mainly attributable to the following:
 • in December 2015, the acquisition by Burger King France SAS of 100% of the capital of Financière Quick SAS (€171 million), less the proceeds from the disposal of operations in Belgium and Luxembourg in 2016 (€44 million)
 • in 2017, the acquisition of BDBK and PINTO (€76 million)
 • in 2018, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€9 million)
 • in 2019, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€2 million) and the classification of Quick operations in assets held for sale.

 The table below shows the change in goodwill.

###### The acquisitions of goodwill are the acquisitions made during the year (see Note 4.2), the change in 2018 goodwill is due to a price adjustment (€50 thousand) and to contractual compensation paid to franchisees.

-----

###### 8.2. Other intangible assets


###### Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost while those acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition.


###### After their initial recognition, intangible assets are not remeasured. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment (see Note 8.4). Note 8.4).

 The "Quick®" brand

 The "Quick®" brand, which was classified under IFRS 5 at 31 December 2019, is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, in consideration of the fact that it is almost 40 years old and its reputation. There is assumed to be no foreseeable limit to the period during which the brand will generate net cash inflows for the Group. 

 Other intangible assets with finite useful lives

 Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist mainly of software and patents, licenses and concessions. The amortization of these assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Number of years

Software 3 to 7
Patents, licenses and concessions 5

###### Leasehold rights (prior to 2019)

 Until 31 December 2018, intangible assets included the following leasehold interests:

 • Leasehold interests acquired through business combinations, which are the commercial and construction
 leasehold interests that Financière Quick acquired when it acquired Quick Restaurants, and which are initially recognized at their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 - "Business Combinations".

 • Leasehold interests acquired separately, i.e. those acquired after Financière Quick's acquisition of Quick
 Restaurants.

 All leasehold interests follow the same depreciation rules:

 • Construction leasehold interests are amortized over the term of the lease (from 30 to 35 years).

 • Commercial leasehold interests are not amortized. In France, the lessee of a commercial lease is entitled
 to an almost unlimited number of lease renewals. If the owner wishes to terminate the lease, the lessee is entitled to an eviction indemnity equal to the value of the business at the date of termination. Accordingly, the useful life of the leasehold interest is indefinite as there is no foreseeable limit to the period during which the leasehold interest is expected to generate net cash inflows. As of 1 January 2019, leasehold interests are recorded under rights of use (see Note 8.3.2).

###### 8.4. Impairment of intangible assets


###### Whenever warranted by a significant internal or external event or circumstance, the Group performs impairment tests on its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and assets under construction are also tested annually for impairment.

 The Group performed asset impairment tests at the following two levels:

 • On each Cash Generating Unit (CGU), which is defined as the smallest group of assets whose cash flows
 are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets. For the Group, each restaurant corresponds to a CGU, whether directly operated or franchised. The net book value of CGUs includes all tangible and intangible assets, except for the brand and goodwill.

 • At the level of the group of CGUs which comprise the Group as a whole, including goodwill, the brand and
 all other tangible and intangible assets, since it is at this level that the Group can monitor the synergy gains of business combinations.


###### This impairment test consists of comparing the recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) with its carrying amount, including rights of use.


###### The recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) is the higher of its value in use or its fair value less the cost of disposal. 

 Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of assets. Cash flow projections are based on the Group's five-year business plan restated for the new IFRS 16 standard (lease cancellation) and are extrapolated to infinity at a long-term growth rate.


###### Cash flows are discounted at the WACC based on market assumptions. This rate is calculated using the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and a size premium. It does not include the Group's debt and tax structure.


###### When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value of the asset or group of assets tested, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In the case of a group of assets, the impairment is initially charged to goodwill.


###### If the recoverable amount of an asset other than goodwill rises back above its net book value at a later date the impairment loss recognized on this asset may be reversed. This reversal cannot exceed the impairment loss initially recorded less any depreciation or amortization that would otherwise have been recognized. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed.


-----

8.4.1. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF RESTAURANT CGUS**

###### The Group individually tested 278 restaurants that had been in operation for at least 12 months at 31 December 2019. 

 These tests resulted in the following impairment losses for five restaurants in 2019 (vs.19 restaurants in 2018), which were recorded in other non-current operating expenses:

Total restaurant CGU & impairment 6 000 3 372 (2 628 ) 14 659 4 794 (9 865 )

###### The recoverable amount of these CGUs was assessed on the basis of their value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions: 

In % Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018
Discount rate 8.10% 8.10%
Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00%

###### The following factors were taken into account to determine the discount rate:
 • the risk-free rate, which is the historical average of the yields of eurozone long-term government bonds;
 • a market risk premium of 7.5% at 31 December 2019 (vs. 7% at 31 December 2018), which is based on the historical average of equity market returns observed in the eurozone;
 • the size premium, which is the excess return that is necessary to compensate for the risk associated with the company's size relative to other companies in its market. The size premium used at 31 December 2019 is 2.8% (vs. 3.7% at 31 December 2018).

 For the CGUs that are not impaired, management has determined that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The table below shows the assumption percentages at which the recoverable amount will equal the carrying amount.

**Rate at which the recoverable value**

**will equal the net book value**
In % Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018

Discount rate 8,10% 8,10%
Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2,00% 2,00%
Revenue growth during the business plan period 1,70% 2,50%
Profit margin during the business plan period 12,00% 11,00%

8.4.2. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE QUICK BRAND**

###### An independent assessment by an external firm of the value in use of the Quick brand on the basis of financial statements at 31 December 2018, revealed no need to recognize impairment on the brand, the net book value of which is €113 million. There is no indication of impairment in 2019.

8.4.3. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE**

###### The recoverable amount of the Group as a whole was assessed on the basis of its value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions: 

In % Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018
Discount rate 8.10% 8.10%
Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00%

###### The Group's estimated recoverable amount at 31 December 2019 exceeds its carrying amount by approximately €904 million.

 Management has determined that a reasonably possible change in the DCF assumptions could cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying amount. The table below shows the assumption percentages at which the recoverable amount will equal the carrying amount.

**Rate at which the recoverable value will**

**equal the net book valu**
In % Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018
Discount rate 13.60% 16.90%
Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value (8.20%) (18.20%)

###### For the recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount in 2019, sales would have to fall by 15.30%, or the profit margin would have to be 5.40%.

 8.5. Off-balance sheet commitments on assets under construction 

 Off-balance sheet commitments on assets under construction totaled €4.0 million at 31 December 2019, vs. €6.6 million at 31 December 2018.

#### 9. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS


###### A provision is recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation at the balance sheet date which is due to a past event that is likely to result in an outflow of resources, the amount of which can be reliably estimated.


###### The provision is the best estimate of the amount that is required to settle the current obligation as of the balance sheet date.

###### Employee benefits are described in Note 7.3.

 The change in provisions for commercial, legal and employee dispute risks in 2019 is mainly explained by the reversal of the provision recognized in 2016 for a dispute with a former France Quick international master franchisee.

 In an arbitration decision issued in the second quarter of 2019, the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris found France Quick's decision to terminate its franchise and brand agreements on the grounds of an irremediable


-----

###### breach to be wrongful and ordered France Quick to compensate this former franchisee for its expenses and investments. The provision recognized over the previous years was therefore reversed and the associated expense was recorded under "Other non-recurring income and expenses" (see Note 6.4), and the attachment was released (see Note 6.5.3).

 The other changes concern disputes with employees and tax authorities but not involving income tax.

 The Group is also involved in several legal proceedings with another of France Quick's former international master franchisee, for which the Group has made no provision as it does not consider this risk to be material.

 The change in provisions in 2018 was mainly attributable to disputes with employees and tax authorities but not involving income tax.


-----

#### 10. FINANCIAL MATTERS AND INSTRUMENTS

###### 10.1. Net financial income/expense


###### The gross cost of debt consists mainly of interest on bonds, charges on the RCF (non-use commission) and interest on other bank debt.

 The net cost of debt is the gross cost of debt plus income from cash investments. Until 31 December 2018, it also included interest on finance lease liabilities.

 Other financial income and expenses consist mainly of:

 • Interest on lease liabilities
 • Mandatory refinancing costs
 • Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments (caps and swaps)
 • Various bank charges
 • Interest on post-employment plan liabilities.


###### Interest is calculated using the effective interest rate method.


###### The table below breaks down the Group's net financial income.

_In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018

Interest on bond debt (35 402) (35 401)

Other financial expenses (22 432 ) (4 528 )

Net financial income/expense (58 562 ) (40 529 )


-----

###### The change in net financial income is mainly attributable to the recognition of interest on lease liabilities under the new IFRS 16 standard. (see Note 3.6.4.2). 

 The interest expense on finance leases of €0.2 million was recorded in 2018 as "Interest on bank debt".

 Interest on post-employment plan liabilities was recorded under "Sundry bank charges and other" and totaled €49 thousand in 2019, vs. €40 thousand in 2018.

 10.2. Financial liabilities, liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests, and lease liabilities


###### Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.

 Non-current financial liabilities consist mainly of bond liabilities, which are recorded net of refinancing costs due in more than year, and bank debt due in more than one year. Current financial liabilities consist of bank debt that is due over the next twelve months, the portion of bond refinancing costs due within one year, bank overdrafts and accrued interest on loans.

 Lease liabilities are recognized as indicated in Note 3.6.


###### Financial liabilities, liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests, and lease liabilities are shown in the table below:

Total 658 023 643 273

- In the 2018 statement of financial position, derivatives were recorded under "other non-current liabilities".

###### All debts were contracted in euros.

 Bank loans

 In 2019, the Group set up new bilateral credit lines on Agaquick, Burger King Restauration and France Quick, for €4.5 million, €3 million and €10.6 million respectively The purpose of these credit lines is to finance restaurant conversion and opening investments.

###### Bond issues

 The table below shows the key characteristics of the Group's bond issues:

_In 000 EUR_ Carrying amount Nominal Maturity Repayment Rate
date

High-yield bond 315 000 100 and multiple of 1 01//05/2024 in fine 6%
Fixed-rate tranche above this amount

High-yield bond 310 000 100 and multiple of 1 01//05/2023 in fine Euribor +5.25%
Floating-rate tranche above this amount

###### Burger King France's €625 million bond issue of 21 April 2017, which was completed on 19 December 2017, is composed of the following two tranches:

 • A fixed-rate €315 million tranche, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on 1 May 2024 and paying 6% interest (semi-annual)

 • A floating-rate tranche of €310 million, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on 1 May 2023 and paying Euribor +5.25% (quarterly). This tranche was issued in two phases: initially on 21 April 2017 for €250 million, with proceeds of 99.5% and the balance recognized as an issuance discount, and subsequently on 19 December 2017 for €60 million, with proceeds of 101.75% and the balance recognized as an issuance premium.

 Burger King France may call some or all of these bonds.

 The €16.9 million in bond issuance costs are spread over the term of the bond. They were €11.4 million at 31 December 2019, vs. €13.8 million at 31 December 2018.

 This change is explained by the spreading out of bond issuance costs in 2019.

###### The revolving credit facility (RCF)

 In April 2017, Burger King France set up a €60 million 5-year RCF with a pool of seven banks. The current margin is Euribor +2.5%, with a 0% floor. 


-----

###### As of 31 December 2019, this RCF has never been used.  If over 35% of the RCF is used, the Group's quarterly leverage ratio (EBITDA / net debt) must not exceed 7.5. This ratio has never been exceeded since this RCF was set up. 

10.2.2. **CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS**


###### Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short- term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are exposed to an insignificant risk of loss.

 In the cash flow statement, this item is composed of cash and cash equivalents, less bank overdrafts.


_In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Change

Cash 104 132 61 106 43 026
Deposit accounts - 44 (44)
Cash assets 104 132 61 150 42 982

Bank overdrafts (1 701) (617) (1 084)
Cash liabilities (1 701 ) (617 ) (1 084 )

###### The change in net cash is mainly explained by cash flow from operating activities and the relatively small amount of net capital expenditures.


-----

10.2.3. **COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE MINORITY INTERESTS**


###### Liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests are recorded at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the put option granted to the minority shareholder relative to the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests. The difference between the liability thus recorded and the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity.

 After its initial recognition, the liability is carried at amortised cost and subsequent changes are recognized in equity.

 In the consolidated income statement, a share of the net income of the Agaquick sub-group is allocated to the non-controlling interests that are still entitled to a share of the subsidiary's earnings.


###### The Group has granted Picpain a put option on its interest in Agaquick. The exercise price of this option was calculated using a contractually predetermined formula. The option may be exercised in 2027. 

 Since the non-controlling interests are still entitled to their share of Agaquick's earnings, the Group has opted for a "mixed" accounting treatment of this commitment. 1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement.

 The Group also has an option to purchase all of the shares that Picpain holds in Agaquick, which it may exercise pursuant to the shareholders' agreement in 2039, or in the event of a change in the ownership structure of Picpain's Agaquick shares, or in the event of a legal dispute for which Picpain is held liable.

Total (601 935 ) (106 ) 180 (601 861 ) (636 499 ) 74 (19 939 ) (656 364 )

###### Note 1: the net book value of current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be reasonably approximate to their fair value. 

 Note 2: the difference between the net book value and the fair value of loans and guarantees is considered immaterial.

 Note 3: As allowed under IFRS, the fair value of the lease liability and its level in the fair-value hierarchy is not provided.

 The fair value of other financial instruments was determined as follows:

 • High-yield bonds and variable-rate loans: their fair value is considered to be near their carrying amount, as the impact of a change in the Group's credit spread is considered immaterial
 • Other fixed-rate financial debts and minority buy-out commitment debts: the fair value of each debt is determined by discounting future cash flows at the closing market rate, which is adjusted to account for the Group's credit risk.
 • Standard valuation models were used to estimate the fair value of derivatives.

###### 10.4. Risk management

10.4.1. **GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY**

###### The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate and currency risks.

 The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its floating-rate debt. To manage this risk the Group uses caps or swaps with first-class counterparties.

 Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies.

 The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health. 

10.4.2. **INTEREST RATE RISK**

###### The Group uses caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives are qualified as cash flow hedging instruments. 

 Hedging is considered to be effective if the Euribor fixing on the hedged loan is strictly equivalent to the fixing of the hedging instrument.

10.4.3. **CURRENCY RISK**

###### The Group's exposure to currency risk is very limited as most of its business is conducted in Europe.

 The Group uses derivatives to hedge the currency risk on these foreign currency purchases. Hedging is carried out using either forward exchange contracts or currency options. Each hedging transaction must be approved in advance by the Group's senior management. 

 There were no currency hedging commitments at 31 December 2018 or 31 December 2019.

 Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk at 31 December 2019, the US dollar's volatility over the year did not have a material impact on income (as in 2018).

10.4.4. **CREDIT RISK**

###### Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group.

 Deposits and guarantees

 The credit risk on deposits and guarantees is considered to be limited.

 Cash and cash equivalents

 With regard to cash and cash equivalents, the credit risk is considered to be limited insofar as:

 • they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day-to- day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles.

 • they are invested exclusively in money market instruments.

 Trade receivables

 Trade receivables are the amounts owed by franchisees.

 They may be impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. Indicators of incurred losses include, for example, significant financial difficulties of a franchisee or a breach of the franchise agreement (e.g. payment is past due more than x days). These receivables deemed to be at risk are fully impaired if there are indicators of incurred credit loss. The provision for such losses totaled €3.3 million at 31 December 2019, vs. €4.1 million at 31 December 2018.

 A statistics-based provision is made for receivables that are not impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. This statistical provision is based on the history of credit losses actually incurred over the pas ten years. At 31 December 2019, this provision was €78 thousand, vs. €69 thousand at 31 December 2018.

 Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables.


-----

10.4.5. **LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE**

###### The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity.

 The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short-term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities.

 The table below shows the maturity profile of financial liabilities at 31 December 2019:

#### 11. INCOME TAX

###### 11.1. Income tax expense


###### Income tax includes current and deferred taxes and the impact of changes in tax rates. Income taxes are recognized in income (except when recorded in other comprehensive income), directly in equity or during business combinations.

 After examining the applicable legislation, the Group considers that the CVAE "business added-value tax" is an income tax as defined under IAS 12.2 ("Income Tax Payable on Taxable Profits").

 The CICE tax credit is treated as an operating subsidy and recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses.

- The 2018 income statement has been restated in view of the planned sale of Quick's operations, which were classified
as discontinued operations under IFRS 5, as explained in Note 4.3.

      - Other differences 352 (466)

     - Difference between company and consolidated tax rates 159      

-----

###### (1) The other tax effects on permanent differences mainly pertain to non-deductible financial expenses, the RSU plan expenses, and the reversal of negative goodwill through income.

 11.2. Deferred tax assets and liabilities

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, on the basis of the tax rates (and tax regulations) that were adopted or substantially adopted at the balance sheet date.

 Deferred tax assets are recognized if the temporary difference is likely to reverse in the foreseeable future and there is likely to be a taxable profit to which the temporary difference may be applied.

 Deferred tax liabilities on interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not recognized unless the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference cannot be controlled and the temporary difference is likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.


###### The table below shows deferred taxes by type and before any offsetting.

TOTAL DEFERRED TAXES (4 286 ) (4 298 )

###### Deferred tax assets were not recognized since it is unlikely that the Group will have future taxable profits against which these tax assets can be applied. At 31 December 2019, the amount of these unrecognized deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards totaled €84.6 million, vs. €91.2 million at 31 December 2018. Tax losses for which no deferred tax has been recognized can be carried forward indefinitely.


-----

#### 12. EQUITY


###### Share capital


###### Preference shares are classified as equity because they pay discretionary dividends, are subject to no redemption obligation in cash or a financial asset, and do not require settlement in a variable number of the Group's equity instruments.  Discretionary dividend distributions are charged directly to equity when approved by a general assembly of shareholders.


###### Share capital totaled €39,162 thousand at 31 December 2019, vs. €40,012 thousand at 31 December 2018, for a decrease of €850 thousand. This capital reduction, which did not serve to absorb a loss, was effected by purchasing and cancelling 17 Class B preference shares. This decision was approved by the Chairman on 10 December 2019.

 Although this decision modified the distribution of share capital, it did not affect its amount. At 31 December 2019, Burger King France's share capital consisted of:
 • 587,478 ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 (vs. 5,836 shares with a value of €1 at 31 December 2018)
 • 566,700 Class A preference shares with a par value of €0.01 (vs. 5,667 shares with a par value of €1 at 31 December 2018)
 • 783 Class B preference shares with a par value of €50 thousand (vs. 8 shares with a par value of €5 million at 31 December 2018).

 Share premium

 The share premium totaled €163.3 million at 31 December 2019, as in 2018.

 Dividends

 Burger King France paid a dividend of €7.19 million in 2019, vs. no dividend in 2018.

##### Statutory auditors’ report  on the consolidated financial statements

For the year ended December 31, 2019

To the annual general meeting of Burger King France S.A.S.,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Burger King France S.A.S. for
the year ended December 31, 2019.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019 and of the results
of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

**_Audit Framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the _Statutory_ _Auditors’_
_Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements applicable
to us, for the period from January 1, 2019 to the date of issue of our report, and in particular
we have not provided any services that are prohibited by the French Code of Ethics (code de
_déontologie) for statutory auditors._

**Emphasis of Matter**

We draw attention to the following matter described in Notes 3.6 to the consolidated financial
statements relating to the “Effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 16” and 3.2 “Changes in the
accounting framework” which highlight the impacts of the first adoption as of January 1, 2019of
IFRS 16 – Leases – and the interpretation of IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax
Treatments –. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Justification of Assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial
Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the
matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

As stated in Note 8.4 to the consolidated financial statements, “Impairment of intangible
assets”,  goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are subject to impairment tests. We have
analyzed the methods of implementation of the impairment tests, as well as the cash flow
forecasts and assumptions used by the management to perform impairment tests, and we have
assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 8.4.

The Group applied the new standard IFRS 16 – Leases – on January 1, 2019, following the
procedure described in Note 3.6 “Effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 16” to the
consolidated financial statements. We have obtained an understanding of the procedures
implemented by the Group to identify the leases within the scope of IFRS 16 standard. For a
sample of contracts, we have also reconciled the data considered by the management to
determine the assets and liabilities related to the leases with specific data from underlying
agreements, assessed the criteria taken into account by the management to determine the
residual lease term with underlying agreements, assessed the appropriateness of the

methodology used to determine the discount rate at the date of the first-time application,
recalculated the amounts of the right-of-use assets and the lease commitments as re-measured
and recognized by the Company as at January 1, 2019, and assessed the appropriateness of
the information related to the impacts of the application of IFRS 16 standard in Note 3.6 to the
consolidated financial statements.

The Group applied IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations –
following the procedure described in Note 4.3 “Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities
held for sales” to the consolidated financial statements. We have assessed the correct application
of the standard, the related impacts and disclosures.

**Specific Verifications**

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group information given in the
management report of the President.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the**
**Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to
liquidate the Company or to cease operations.


The consolidated financial statements were approved by the President.


**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our
statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of
management of the affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France,
the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

 - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

 - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.

 - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated
financial statements.

 - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a
material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not
provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

 - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses
whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner
that achieves fair presentation.

 - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion
expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

 The Group develops and perfects a fast-food restaurant concept that is based predominantly on hamburgers and employs various techniques, knowledge and know-how that are appropriate for this type of restaurant.

 The Group is composed of the following three strategic divisions[1]: - Franchise, which consists of the restaurants operated by franchisees - Company-owned, which consists in the restaurants the Group operates - Other business activities, which consist mainly of logistics, marketing, advertising and head- office management activities.

 The consolidated financial statements present the accounting situation of Burger King France S.A.S and its subsidiaries (together the "Group") and the interest held in a joint venture. They are presented in euros, with figures rounded off to the nearest thousand.

 The Group's financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December.

 The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 were approved by the Chairman on 13 March 2019 and will be proposed for approval at the forthcoming annual shareholders meeting.

#### 2. A SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ACCOUNTING METHODS

###### 2.1. General accounting policies

 The consolidated financial statements of the Burger King France Group for 2018 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted mandatorily in the European Union at 31 December 2018, and with SIC and IFRIC interpretations thereof.

1 In accordance with IFRS 8 "Operating Segments", the information provided by operating segment is derived from the internal
organization of Burger King Group's business activities. It reflects the perspective of the Group’s management and is based on
internal reports that are used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance.

###### 2018 consolidated financial statements – GROUPE BURGER KING FRANCE

###### All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at https//www.euronext.com.//ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ecno-1606- 2002/amending-and-supplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutinyrps_en#individual- rps-acts-adopting-international-accounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric.

###### In preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group has observed the same accounting standards, interpretations and policies observed for the year ended 31 December 2017, or, where applicable, the new standards which came into effect on 1 January 2018.

 2.2. Changes in the accounting framework

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2018

 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2018 are:

 - IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (see Note 2.7 below)

 - IFRS 9 – Financial instruments (see Note 2.7 below)

 - The amendments to IFRS 2 “Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions”

 - IFRIC 22 “Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration”

 - Amendments to IAS 28 "Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures"

 - IFRS annual improvements– 2014 - 2016 cycle.

 Apart from IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 (the impacts of which are explained in note 2.7), the other standards had no impact on the Group's accounts.

 Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2019

 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2019:

 - IFRS 16 – Leases

 This new standard will replace IAS 17 and the associated IFRIC and SIC interpretations on 1 January 2019 and will eliminate, for lessees, the distinction between "operating leases" and "finance leases".

 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING


-----

###### Lessees will be required to account for all leases with a term of more than one year in accordance with the method currently used for finance leases under IAS 17, and thus recognize leasehold interests and obligations respectively as assets and liabilities. The impact of the application of this standard on the financial statements is being determined. The cumulative catch-up method will be used during the transitional period. The Group has undertaken an inventory of its leases and their main clauses. The main impacts expected have to do with the restatement of finance leases.

 The magnitude of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 can be assessed on the basis of the amount of operating lease commitments (see note 27). However, given the changes in standards and the Group's assumptions, lease commitments may not be fully representative of the lease liability that will be recognized under IFRS 16.

 - Amendments to IFRS 9 "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation" - IFRIC Interpretation 23 on “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”.

 Lastly, the following IASB standards and interpretations were not yet adopted by the European Union as of 31/12/2018 but are likely to apply to the Group:
 - Amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement - IFRS annual improvements – 2015-2017 cycle - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Materiality

 2.3. Use of estimates and judgments

 In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements.

 The Group's management makes these estimates and assessments on an ongoing basis, based on past experience and various factors it considers to be reasonable.

 Unexpected changes in events and circumstances, particularly within the Group's business environment, may cause actual results to differ from these estimates.

 The most material estimates made by the Group's management concern intangible assets (mainly the brand and leasehold interests), provisions and asset impairment tests.

 Information on the critical judgments made with regard to IAS 17 “Leases” is provided in note 8.7.

 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING


-----

###### 2.4. Consolidation methods

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Burger King France SAS and its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

 The Group's main subsidiaries and joint ventures are listed in Note 4 "Scope of consolidation".

 Consolidation of subsidiaries

 A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. The Group controls a company when it is exposed to, or is entitled to, variable returns from its relationship with the company and may have an impact on these returns through its control over the company. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date that such control is initially obtained and until it ceases.

 Equity method of accounting for joint ventures

 A joint venture is a form of partnership that gives the Group joint control over a company and rights to the net assets of the joint venture, but no rights to its assets or obligations in respect of its liabilities.

 Burger King France accounts its joint ventures using the equity method.

 2.5. Foreign currency translation methods

 The Group's presents its accounts in euros, which is its functional currency.

 Foreign currency transactions

 Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement.

 2.6. Measurement bases

 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, with the exception of certain types of assets and liabilities for which IFRS standards are observed.

 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING

###### 2.7. Effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9

 As of 1 January 2018, the Group has observed IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments".

 IFRS 15 "REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS"

 This new standard deals with the recognition of revenue and replaces existing requirements and in particular those of IAS 11 and IAS 18. Burger King France will observe the cumulative catch-up method during the transition to this new standard. Information relating to the 2017 financial year is presented in accordance with the former IAS 18 standard.

 Transition adjustments totaling - €3,216 thousand were recognized in equity on 1 January 2018.

 To determine this standard's impact on its financial statements, the Group has reviewed the most significant customer contracts in its various business segments. It has thus determined that the application of the new standard impacts the timing of the recognition of revenue from franchise entry fees, which entitle franchisees to use the Group's intellectual property. Accordingly, revenue and expenses related to franchise entry fees are now recognized over the term of the agreement.

 This has resulted in the recognition of €1,472 thousand in "Other income" on the income statement.

 The table below shows the impacts on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018, which includes a €3,216 thousand adjustment on opening equity.

###### 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING


-----

###### The accounting rules and methods the Group has observed in applying IFRS 15 are described in Note 3.7 "Income recognition".

 IFRS 9 – Financial instruments

 IFRS 9 has been observed as of 1 January 2018 using the limited retrospective method, with no adjustment of comparative amounts. This new standard replaces IAS 39, which was observed until 31 December 2017.

 On this date, the first application of IFRS 9 resulted in the reclassification of cap hedging items from consolidated reserves to cash flow hedging reserves. This reclassification amounted to €854 thousand.

 The other provisions of IFRS 9 had no impact on the amount of consolidated equity at 1 January 2018. The Group's analyses and conclusions are presented below for each phase the reclassification.

 Phase I - Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities

 The Group has reviewed its financial assets in accordance with the new IFRS 9 classification, which is based on the company's business model and the contractual characteristics of the financial assets. The Group's financial assets consist mainly of loans, receivables and deposits and have therefore not been affected by the change and continue to be measured using the amortized cost method.

 All financial assets are always presented on the line "Financial assets" and are described in Note 18 of these notes: "Financial receivables and other non-current assets".

 Phase 2 - Financial asset impairment

 The Group's analysis focused mainly on the impairment of trade receivables, as the Group has no significant non-group loans and no significant financial receivables. The Group has opted to use the simplified method to measure the impairment of its trade receivables. A review of the historical loss experience of these receivables did not reveal any material amount and no adjustment for this was made to the Group's opening equity.

 Phase 3 - Hedge Accounting

 The Group's analysis did not reveal any renegotiation of financing that required restatement. The changes to the method used to account for the Group's hedging instruments reduced shareholders' equity by €854 thousand. This impact is explained by the change in the accounting treatment of the time value of options, with interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The reclassification of financial instruments pursuant to the IFRS 9 categories had no overall impact on the measurement bases of financial assets and liabilities.

 The accounting rules and methods the Group has observed in applying IFRS 15 are described in Notes 3.18 "Financial assets", 3.19 "Financial liabilities" and 3.20 "Derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions".

#### 3. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

###### 2018 was marked by the following significant events.

 System-wide sales

 At 31 December 2018, system-wide sales totaled €1,216 million. This is €109 million more than at 31 December 2017 and represents 9.9% growth. The growth is attributable to: - the positive impact of the ongoing conversion of restaurants to the Burger King® brand in France, - the good performance of Quick on a comparable restaurant basis.

 Profitability

 Thanks to an €109 million increase in system-wide sales compared to 31 December 2017, the Group increased: - its profitability, with EBITDA of €111.5 million, representing 27.6% annual growth - the ratio of EBITDA over Sales and Franchise income to 17.7%, vs.14.7% at 31 December 2017. This good performance was mainly due to the ongoing development of the Burger King® brand in France throughout 2018.

 Business development

 To consolidate its network, the Group had invested €93 million at 31 December 2018, mainly in restaurant openings and conversions.

 Financing and acquisition

 In 2018, the Group paid the €15.9 million balance of its 2017 acquisition of BDBK.

 On February 26, 2018, Burger King Restauration (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Burger King France) acquired majority stakes in three new companies: Flagship Restauration (50.71%), BK Expansion (84.44%) and BK Développement (73.12%). These companies operate four restaurants under the Burger King® brand.

 During the year, the Group also: - set up new bilateral credit lines, mainly for Agaquick and BK expansion, for respectively €4,500 thousand and €950 thousand. These credit lines will serve to finance conversion investments. - repaid in advance Burger King France's 2016 CICE pre-financing debt of €4,133 thousand to BPI France and factored without recourse its 2016, 2017 and 2018 CICE receivable to a bank for approximately €13,700 thousand. - factored without recourse BDBK's 2017 CICE receivable to a factor for approximately €1,100 thousand.

###### Litigation

 Following a new decision by the enforcement judge of the Bobigny Tribunal de Grande Instance concerning the dispute with our former Turkish franchisee, the amount of €5.5 million was frozen in France Quick's bank accounts on March 5, 2018 as a protective measure. France Quick has contested this. The procedure to contest this attachment of assets is still ongoing as of the date of publication of our consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018 and no conclusions may be drawn as to the merits of the judge's decision. All long-term provisions are detailed in Note 8.13.

#### 5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL

###### Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities that meet the IFRS recognition criteria are generally recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date.

 Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any interest previously held in the acquiree) plus the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognized (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Non-controlling interests are measured when control is gained, either pro rata to the identifiable net assets or at fair value, depending on the option selected.

 When the difference thus determined is negative, and after the various components are remeasured, it can be immediately taken to income.

 Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment loss. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement and are irreversible.

 An increase in the interest held in a subsidiary or a decrease that does not result in a loss of control is not a business combination but a transaction with non-controlling interests that is recognized directly in equity.

#### 6. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCOUNTED OPERATIONS

###### A non-current asset or a group of associated assets and liabilities is considered to be held for sale in the following cases, in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”:
  the asset or group is available for immediate sale in its present condition  its sale is highly likely, which is the case when management has undertaken efforts to sell the asset or group and to find a buyer at a reasonable price and has committed to sell it within one year.

 Non-current assets, groups of assets or businesses held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value (i.e. the estimated selling price), net of disposal costs. They are presented on a separate line on the balance sheet and are no longer depreciated or amortized.

 Only complete discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement.

 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING

###### The Group disposed of no business activity during the year.

#### 7. NOTES TO THE INCOME STATEMENT

###### 7.1. Operating revenue

 Operating revenue is presented on the income statement line item "Sales and franchise income" and consists mainly of:

 - The sales of company-operated restaurants, which are recognized at their net-of-tax amount at the time of purchase in the restaurant.

 - Income from franchisees:  the royalties received from franchisees for the use of the Burger King® and Quick® brands.  property and business lease income, less payment waivers (calculated as a percentage of sales and charged to franchisees for the occupancy of the premises and the leasehold interests).  Franchisee contributions to national advertising expenditures.  The income of subsidiary Logirest France from the sale of merchandise and equipment to Quick franchisees.

 The various types of franchise agreements are: full franchise, shared franchise, business lease, and business lease with investment. The percentage paid depends on the type of agreement.

###### 7.7. Income tax

 Corporate income tax includes current and deferred taxes and the impact of changes in tax rates. It is recognized on the income statement, except when associated with items that are recognized directly in equity or through other comprehensive income, in which case it is also recognized outside of profit and loss. Current tax consists of the tax payable on the year’s taxable income calculated at the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and of prior-period adjustments.

 After examining the applicable legislation, the Group considers that the CVAE "business added-value tax" is an income tax as defined under IAS 12.2 ("Income Tax Payable on Taxable Profits").

 The CICE tax credit is treated as an operating subsidy and recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses. The CICE tax credit receivable that is "anticipated", i.e. calculated during the year of payment of the remuneration on which it is based and before the payment of tax in 2018, was factored to a credit institution.

###### 8.2. Intangible assets

 Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost while those acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition.

 After their initial recognition, intangible assets are not remeasured. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment (see Note 8.4).

 The "Quick®" brand

 The "Quick®" brand is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, in consideration of the fact that it is almost 40 years old and its reputation. It should be noted that there is no foreseeable limit to the period

###### Following the acquisition of Financière Quick by Burger King France on December 17, 2015, a plan was prepared to convert Quick restaurants in France to the Burger King brand over a four-year period. This conversion plan began in mid-2016 and will be completed by mid-2020. The net value of the Quick brand was maintained at €113 million at 31 December 2018.

 An impairment test of Quick royalties revealed no impairment at 30 December 2018.

 Research and development

 Research expenditures in view of acquiring new scientific or technical knowledge are expensed when incurred.

 Development expenditures in view of applying research findings to a plan or concept in order to make new or significantly improved products and processes are capitalized if all of the recognition requirements of IAS 38 - "Intangible Assets" are met.

 Leasehold interests

  Leasehold interests acquired through business combinations are the commercial and construction leasehold interests that Financière Quick acquired when it acquired Quick Restaurants, and which are initially recognized at their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 - "Business Combinations". They are subject to the same amortization rules as leasehold interests acquired separately.

  Leasehold interests acquired separately are those acquired after Financière Quick's acquisition of Quick Restaurants.

 In France, construction leasehold interests are amortized over the term of the lease (from 30 to 35 years) and are classified as intangible assets with a finite useful life.

 Commercial leasehold interests are not amortized and are classified as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In France, the lessee of a commercial lease is entitled to an almost unlimited number of lease renewals. If the owner wishes to terminate the lease, the lessee is entitled to an eviction indemnity equal to the value of the business at the date of termination. Accordingly, the useful life of the leasehold interest is indefinite as there is no foreseeable limit to the period during which the leasehold interest is expected to generate net cash inflows.

###### The value in use of non-amortized leasehold interests is allocated to the restaurant CGU and is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment.

###### 8.3. Property, plant and equipment

 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. This cost includes the cost of purchasing or making the asset and the expenses that are directly incurred to install and use the asset. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises significant components that have different useful lives, these components are recognized and depreciated separately.

 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an eligible asset are included in the asset's initial cost, in accordance with IAS 23. The Group has identified no assets at 31 December 2018 that require restatement for this.

 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

 The following estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are used:

###### The main changes in fiscal 2018 are explained below:

  Purchases: €105 million, mainly consisting of investments required to open new restaurants or to convert existing Quick® restaurants to the Burger King® brand  Change in scope: €17.6 million, mainly resulting from the acquisition of Flagship, BK Développement and BK Expansion.

  Disposals: -€33.5 million, mainly due to the scrapping of fixed assets during the conversion of restaurants to Burger King or when permanently closing restaurants.

 8.4. Asset impairment

 Whenever warranted by a significant internal or external event or circumstance, the Group performs impairment tests on its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and assets under construction are also tested annually for impairment.

 These impairment tests consist in comparing the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit (CGU), with its carrying amount.

 The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less the cost of disposal.

 A CGU is defined as the smallest group of assets whose cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of an asset or a CGU.

 In accordance with IAS 36, the Group discounts future cash flows using a WACC rate that is based on market assumptions. This rate is calculated using the risk-free interest rate[2], the market risk premium [3] and a size premium[4]. It does not include the Group's debt and tax structure.

 When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value of the asset or group of assets tested, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In the case of a group of assets, the impairment is initially charged to goodwill.

2 the risk-free rate used is based on the historical average of the yields of eurozone long-term government bonds.
3 The market risk premium used is 7%. It is based on a historical average of equity market returns observed in the eurozone.
4 The size premium is the excess return that is necessary to compensate for the risk associated with the company's size relative
to other companies in its market. The size premium used is 3.7%.

###### 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING


-----

###### If the recoverable amount of an asset other than goodwill rises back above its net book value at a later date the impairment loss recognized on this asset may be reversed. This reversal cannot exceed the impairment loss initially recorded less any depreciation or amortization that would otherwise have been recognized. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed.

 The Group performed asset impairment tests at the following three levels:

 • the CGUs identified at the Burger King France Group level as a restaurant, whether operated by the Group or by a franchisee. The recoverable amount of a CGU is its future after-tax cash flows discounted over 5 years plus a terminal value.

 • The brand, using the method described in section 3.13.

 • The Group level, i.e. all of the Group’s fixed assets including goodwill, the brand, all other intangible assets and PPE. The impairment testing of the above assets compares their balance sheet value with their discounted after-tax future cash flows over 5 years plus a terminal value.

 These three types of tests constitute the various steps of the impairment testing process.

 Quick brand impairment test

 The impairment test on the Quick brand was performed using the royalties method and required no recognition of impairment of the brand, the net book value of which is €113 million.

 The main assumptions for this test were the royalties rate, changes thereto, and the discount rate. The Group also performed sensitivity analyses with the following assumptions: - A 20 bp decrease in the perpetual growth rate - A 10 bp increase in the discount rate.

 The results of these sensitivity analyses do not require the recognition of impairment for the brand.

###### 8.5. Deferred taxes

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities must be measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the year when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on the tax rates (and tax regulations) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

 Deferred tax assets are recognized if the temporary difference is likely to reverse in the foreseeable future and there is likely to be a taxable profit to which the temporary difference may be applied.

 Deferred tax liabilities on interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures are recognized unless the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference cannot be controlled and the temporary difference is not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.

 The table shows deferred taxes by type.

 Loans and guarantees are mainly provided for operating leases. They are paid when a new lease is agreed. These financial assets are held with a view to receiving contractual cash flows. When initially recognized, they are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date, which is generally the price of

###### 8.7. Leases

 Leases are classified as finance leases if substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group.

 Leases under which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.

 As a lessee

 Recognition of finance leases

 Finance leases are initially recognized as assets and liabilities at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease if this can be determined. Otherwise the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. The direct costs initially incurred by the lessee are added to the recognition amount of the asset.

 After the initial recognition, the minimum lease payments are allocated between the finance charge and the amortization of the remaining liability. The finance charge must be allocated to each period of the lease so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for

###### each period. Leased assets are also depreciated using a method that is consistent with the method the Group's normally uses to depreciate its assets.

 Types of finance leases

 The Burger King France Group classifies restaurant POS leases and real property leases as finance leases. Restaurant POS leases have an average term of 3 to 5 years and include a renewal or buyback option. The average term of real property leases is 12 years.

###### The change over the period is exclusively attributable to payments made on leases.

 The decrease in the current portion (less than 1 year) is due to the reclassification from short-term to long-term of property lease liabilities for which the exercise of the purchase option has been deferred beyond 2019.

 Recognition of operating leases

 Lease payments under operating leases are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Any amounts received or to be received by the lessee as an incentive for signing the lease agreement are also recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 Types of operating leases

 Operating leases are mainly construction leases and commercial leases.

###### Future minimum lease payments from franchised restaurants are subject to the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) clause in the property or business lease agreement.

 Furthermore, the Group's gross profit margin substantially exceeds the amount of rent it pays.

 The increase in total minimum lease payments in 2018 is attributable to the increase in the number of restaurants.

 Undiscounted payments on operating leases totaled €484 million at 31 December 2018.

 As a lessor

 Recognition of finance leases

 Assets held under finance leases as lessor are presented as receivables for the net investment in the lease. Lease payments are recorded as financial income.

 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING

###### Recognition of operating leases

 Leased assets are presented in the balance sheet according to the nature of the asset. Income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another method is more representative of the time pattern of the decline in the benefit derived from the use of the leased asset. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and are expensed over the term of the lease on the same basis as lease income. The method used to depreciate leased depreciable assets is consistent with the method the lessor normally uses to depreciate similar assets.

 As lessor, Burger King Group France considers business leases, business leases with investments and real property leases to be operating leases.

 The term of business leases is 9+9 years for Burger King® restaurants, and from 3 to 12 years for Quick restaurants. Shared franchise agreements for Quick have a term of nine years.

 The Group's inventories consist of supplies, equipment and food products. They are recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price plus customs duties, other non-recoverable taxes, and the costs of transportation and handling incurred in bringing inventory items to their storage site.

 Equipment inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method.

 The food products inventory is valued using the FIFO method (First in, First Out) given the rapid turnover of this inventory and the rules that apply to its management.

###### Trade and other operating receivables are initially recognized at their fair value, which is generally their nominal value. There are no trade receivables that are pledged or insured.

 In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group uses the simplified method to measure trade receivables and recognizes expected credit losses over the life of the receivable. Expected credit losses are estimated using an allowance matrix that is based on historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for specific factors relating to the creditor, current general economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions that are obtainable at the balance sheet date without incurring undue cost or effort. The expected credit losses measured using the simplified approach totaled €72 thousand for 2018.

###### Share-based payments

 The Group's share-based payments and settlements comply with IFRS 2 "Share-based Payments".

 Pursuant to this standard, share subscription and purchase options and performance shares granted to employees are measured at their fair value, which must be recognized in income over the vesting period with corresponding increases in equity. The latter amounted to €899 thousand in 2018.

 The valuation models used to determine this fair value of options and rights are based on the terms of the vesting plan, the market data available at the grant date and the assumptions of the Group’s management.

 The Group implemented an RSU plan in 2018.

 Non-controlling interests

 The non-controlling interests are: - The sub-group consisting of Agaquick SAS and its subsidiaries[5], in which the Group has a 50% stake - BK Expansion, BK Development and Flagship.

5 The Group has agreed to sell its stake in Agaquick via a put option.
Burger King France considers this put option to be a transaction between shareholders and has observed the
following mixed accounting treatment:
1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the
difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity.
2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income
statement.

###### The change in provisions in 2018 is mainly attributable to employment and tax disputes.

 "Litigation" consists in particular of a provision of €2.5 million for an ongoing dispute with our former franchisee in Turkey, which was provisioned in 2016.

 At the end of November 2015, France Quick terminated its franchise and Quick brand usage contracts with its franchisee when it was brought to its attention that the franchisee had registered a number of trademarks containing the name "Quick" in violation of the contractual provisions. At the end of January 2016, the franchisee filed an arbitration claim against France Quick with the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. The former franchisee: - challenges the grounds for terminating the franchise and brand usage contracts - claims damages.

 The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is expected to render its decision in the first half of 2019.

 The group's legal advisors and management dispute the validity of the franchisee's action and have decided to maintain the €2.5 million provision in their accounts.

 During the arbitration period (the procedure was completed when our consolidated financial statements for 2018 were published, but the decision had not been rendered), the former franchisee had two attachment orders issued on France Quick's accounts. An attachment of €9.4 million was effected for an initial claim in November 2016 and was recorded under "Other financial receivables". A second attachment of €5.5 million was effected in March 2018 for a second claim that was made for a significantly higher amount. France Quick has contested both of these attachments and these two actions are still pending as of the date of publication of our 2018 consolidated financial statements.

 8.14. Employee benefits

 The post-employment benefits granted by the Group in a specific locality depend on legal requirements and the policy observed.

 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING


-----

###### The Group's employees receive short-term benefits (paid leave, sick leave, etc.) and post-employment benefits under defined contribution plans (lump-sum retirement payments and supplementary pension plans). All Group entities expense short-term benefits the year the expense is incurred.

 Defined contribution plans

 Under a defined-contribution plan contributions are regularly paid to an external organization that is responsible for the administration of the plan and the management of its assets. Such plans release the employer from any future obligation, as the external organization assumes responsibility for paying the amounts due to employees under the basic social security pension plan, the ARRCO and AGIRC supplementary pension plans and the employer’s defined-contribution plan. The Group's payments are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

  Lump-sum retirement payments

 In France, lump-sum retirement payments under wage agreements are the only type of defined-benefit post-employment benefit. The Group’s wage agreement provides for the payment of a lump-sum benefit that is a function of the employees' length of service with the Group and his or her salary at the time of retirement.

 With the exception of derivative instruments, all financial liabilities, in particular borrowings, trade payables and other payables, are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Given the normally rapid payment of trade payables, they are generally recognized at their nominal value.

 The effective interest rate is determined for each transaction and is used to calculate the carrying amount of the financial liability by discounting its estimated future cash flows until maturity or until the date nearest to repricing at the market rate. This calculation includes transaction costs and any premiums or discounts. Transaction costs include any cost that is directly related to the acquisition or issuance of a financial liability.

###### Non-current financial liabilities consist mainly of bonds (see "Significant events of the year").

 The increase in bank loans in 2018 is attributable to the entry into the consolidation scope of the debts of the three investment vehicle companies acquired in 2018, which had cumulative long-term debts of €8,800 thousand, and to a new long-term €4,500 thousand-euro credit line for the Agaquick JV to finance restaurant conversion CapEx, less loan repayments over the year.

 The decrease in other financial liabilities of more than one year is due to debt repayment over the year.

 Other non-current financial liabilities

 During the year, the Group entered into a put option with Picpain to buy its stake in Agaquick. The exercise price of this option was calculated using a predetermined formula. In accordance with IAS 32, the purchase commitment for this fully consolidated subsidiary is recognized at the present value of the estimated exercise price. The Group has presented the amount of the "minority put" directly on the consolidated balance sheet.

 The Group has treated this put option as a transaction between shareholders. The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. In future periods, this liability will be recorded at amortized cost and subsequent changes will be recorded in equity.

###### Bonds accounted for most of the Group's debt at 31 December 2018.

 On 21 April 2017, the Burger King France group refinanced its debt on the High Yield bond market by issuing €315,000 thousand in fixed-rate bonds and €250,000 thousand in floating-rate bonds.

 On that same day, the group repaid all of the bank loans that Burger King Restauration had contracted with a banking pool to finance the openings of Burger King restaurants and part of the Financière Quick bond loan arranged in 2014. The balance was repaid in May 2017.

 On 19 December 2017, the Burger King Group refinanced more debt in the High Yield bond market by issuing a €60,000 thousand tranche in addition to its €250,000 thousand floating-rate issue under the same terms, thus increasing its floating-rate issuance to €310,000 thousand.

 8.17. Financial instruments

 Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet under other non-current assets or as current or non-current financial liabilities depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and are measured at their fair value on the date of the transaction.

 The method used to recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether there is a documented hedging relationship as defined in IFRS 9: - in the absence of a hedging relationship, changes in fair value are taken to income - if there is a documented relationship for hedging cash flows, the change in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedging derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income while that of the ineffective portion is directly taken to the income statement.

 Both of these situations apply to the Burger King Group. The Group uses caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate financial liabilities. These derivatives enable the Group to hedge its exposure to rising interest rates and consequently its financial expenses.

 The amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are taken to the income statement symmetrically with the recognition of the hedged items.

###### The following methods are used to determine fair value: - Debt: the fair value of debt is determined for each loan by discounting future cash flows at the closing market rate which is adjusted to account for the Group's credit risk. For floating-rate loans and bank overdrafts, the fair value is approximately equal to the net book value. - High yield bonds: these bonds are valued on the basis of observable market data. - Other long-term financial liabilities: the fair value of other long-term financial liabilities was determined by discounting the future cash flows of each liability at an interest rate that takes into consideration the Group's credit risk at the balance sheet date. - Derivative instruments: the market value of derivatives held at the end of the year was determined using standard valuation models and the available market data.

 The following fair value hierarchy is observed, in accordance with the revised IFRS 7 standard on "Financial Instruments: Disclosures:" - Level 1: fair value based on prices quoted in an active market - Level 2: fair value measured using observable market data (other than the quoted prices included in Level 1) - Level 3: fair value determined using valuation techniques based on unobservable market data.

#### 9. RISK MANAGEMENT

###### 9.1. Capital management policy

 The Group's primary objective in managing its capital is to maintain a good credit risk rating and capital ratios, in order to facilitate its business activities and maximize shareholder value. There was no change in its management objectives, policies and procedures in 2018. The Group's financial indicators are described in Note 14.

 9.2. Risk management policy

 The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate and currency risks.

 The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its variable-rate debt. To manage this risk the Group uses caps or swaps with first-class counterparties.

 Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies.

 The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health.

 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING


-----

###### 9.3. Interest rate risk

 The derivatives used are qualified as hedging instruments and are treated as cash-flow hedges on the caps and swaps.

 Hedging is considered to be effective if the Euribor fixing on the hedged loan is strictly equivalent to the fixing of the hedging instrument.

###### To hedge its exposure to interest rate risk, the Group uses financial instruments that enable it to fix and/or cap the interest rate paid on a significant portion of its debt.

 Interest rate risk is managed centrally using simple instruments, swaps and/or options that are eligible for hedge accounting.

###### 9.4. Credit risk

 Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group.

 The Group considers that the following financial assets have little exposure to credit risk:

 Financial receivables and other non-current assets, in particular guarantees on leases arranged with recognized financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are exposed to very little risk, since:

  they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day-to-day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles.

  they are invested exclusively in money market instruments.

 Monitoring of trade receivables risk:

###### Trade receivables are the amounts owed by franchisees. Credit risk assessment and the decision to impair a trade receivable are made on a case-by-case basis.

 Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables.

 9.5. Currency risk

 The Group's exposure to currency risk is very limited as most of its business is conducted in Europe. The main currency exposure is to the USD, subsequent to the purchase of various merchandise in this currency.

 The Group uses derivatives to hedge the currency risk on these foreign currency purchases. Hedging is carried out using either forward exchange contracts or currency options. Each hedging transaction must be approved in advance by the Group's senior management.

 There were no currency hedging commitments at 31 December 2018, as was the case at the end of 2017.

 Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk at 31 December 2018, the US dollar's volatility over the year did not have a material impact on income.

 9.6. Liquidity risk and outstanding debt

 The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity.

 Management believes that the Group is not subject to liquidity risk at 31 December 2018.

 The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short- term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities.

 The table below shows outstanding debt at 31 December 2018.

##### Statutory auditors’ report  on the consolidated financial statements

For the year ended December 31, 2018

To the annual general meeting of Burger King France S.A.S.,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Burger King France S.A.S. for
the year ended December 31, 2018.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2018 and of the results
of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

**_Audit Framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory _Auditors’_
_Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements applicable
to us, for the period from January 1, 2018 to the date of issue of our report, and in particular
we have not provided any services that are prohibited by the French Code of Ethics (code de
_déontologie) for statutory auditors._

**Emphasis of Matter**

We draw attention to the following matter described in Notes 2.7 to the consolidated financial
statements relating to the effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts
with Customers – and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments –, on January 1, 2018. Our opinion is not
modified in respect of this matter.

**Justification of Assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial
Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the
matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

As stated in Note 8.4 to the consolidated financial statements, “Impairment of intangible
assets”,  goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are subject to impairment tests. We have
analyzed the methods of implementation of the impairment tests as well as the cash flow
forecasts and assumptions used by the management to perform impairment tests, and we have
assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 8.4.

As stated in Note 8.13 to the consolidated financial statements, “Long-term provisions”, a
provision is recorded when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation. Concerning the
ongoing litigation with the former franchisee operating in Tunisia, as described in Note 8.13
“Long-term provisions” to the consolidated financial statements, based on information available
as of today, we have appreciated the amount of the provision by obtaining an understanding of
the process implemented by the Company with the support of its external counsels to estimate
the provision. We have assessed reasonable assurance on the estimate and the information
disclosed in the note 8.13 “Long-term provisions” to the consolidated financial statements.

**Specific Verifications**

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group information given in the
management report of the President.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the**
**Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to
liquidate the Company or to cease operations.


The consolidated financial statements were approved by the President.


**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our
statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of
management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France,
the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures

responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

 - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.

 - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated
financial statements.

 - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a
material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not
provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

 - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses
whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner
that achieves fair presentation.

 - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion
expressed on these consolidated financial statements.
