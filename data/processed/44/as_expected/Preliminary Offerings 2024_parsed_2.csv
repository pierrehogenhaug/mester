These forward-looking statements include matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding the Issuer’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Group’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, competition in areas of the Group’s business, outlook and growth prospects, strategies and the industry in which the Group operates. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. You are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that the Group’s actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if the Group’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause those material differences include: - the impact of competition on the Group’s business; - the impact of macro-economic events by the Group’s strategy to expand internationally; - the impact of unforeseen events such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events; - the Group largely depends on the franchisor of its largest brand and the success of the Burger King brand worldwide; - the impact of changes in consumer preferences and perceptions; - food safety, food traceability, food borne illness and hygiene-related concerns; - the impact of having limited number of third-party suppliers; - the Group’s ability to adopt new ESG policies; - the dependence on our corporate reputation and the value and perception of the Group’s brands; - the lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or decline in the quality of the locations of the Group’s current restaurants; - the impact of changes in raw material costs, fuel, electricity, utilities, distribution and other operating costs; ----- - the Group’s ability to attract and retain franchisees; - the Group’s ability to control franchisees and to implement the Group’s strategic initiatives; - the Group’s ability to implement its strategy through all its portfolio; - the Group’s ability to accurately evaluate the performance of its portfolio and calculate its fees; - the impact of the French franchise regulation on the Group’s relationship with its franchisees; - the Group’s ability to successfully implement its restaurant development and growth strategy; - the impact of integrating or disposing restaurant brands on the Group’s business; - the Group’s ability to expand internationally; - the impact of the seasonal food industry; - the impact of leasing substantial amount of space; - the impact of managing numerous employees; - the Group’s reliance on key executives; - the Group’s exposure to risks related to litigation and negative publicity, including litigation with franchisees; - the Group’s ability to adequately protect its intellectual property; - the impact of IT system failures or interruptions or breaches of the Group’s network security; - the ability to adequately protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees; - the risk of amplified negative publicity due to the increased use of social media; - the Group’s ability to promote its products to its key target market through media advertising subject to specific legislation; - the adoption of new governmental and environmental regulations; - the adequacy of the Group’s insurance coverage against claims; - the impact of compliance failure on regulatory matters; ----- - tax risks; - the impact of tax changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position; - the Group’s ability to deduct all or a portion of the interest on its indebtedness incurred in France; - risks related to the Group’s presentation of financial and other information; - risks related to the Issuer’s and their subsidiaries’ indebtedness; and - risks related to the Notes and the Collateral.

New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Issuer to predict all such risk factors on the Group’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer also presents certain pro forma run-rate adjustments to the Group’s Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma franchise sales and revenues which model the additional EBITDA and franchise sales and revenues the Group would have generated for (i) the year ended December 31, 2023, if all of the restaurants within the Group perimeter that were opened during the twelve months from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 had been operational during an entire twelve-month period and (ii) the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, if all of the restaurants within the Group perimeter that were opened during the twelve months from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024 had been operational during an entire twelve-month period. Such Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate Normalized EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate franchise sales and revenues are not intended to be a projection of future performance and investors should not place undue reliance thereon. Such information is based on audited financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and unaudited financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and certain other management estimates and assumptions which are further described under “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial _Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Operational Data” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_ You are urged to read the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and “Business” for a more_ complete discussion of the factors that could affect the Group’s future performance and the markets in which the Group’s operates. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum may not occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. Neither the Issuer nor any of its subsidiaries assumes any obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in factors affecting these statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Issuer or its subsidiaries or to persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk Factors”. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are France’s leading multi-brand food service franchising platform, renowned for our diverse and strategically curated portfolio of market-leading restaurant brands. Our portfolio encompasses a variety of eight wellpositioned distinct restaurant brands that cater to a wide range of attractive food service market segments, from QSR to casual dining formats, addressing all-day consumption occasions, as illustrated in the graphic below. We own six out of the eight restaurant brands in our portfolio (Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon, Volfoni, Pitaya and Jôyô), while we are the master franchisee in France for the remaining two brands (Burger King and Itsu). Our network spans over 1,000 restaurants across attractive locations throughout France, partnering with 423 franchisees, who together operated 83% of our restaurant network as of December 31, 2023. The remaining 17% of our restaurant network was comprised of directly-operated company restaurants (the “Company",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,"Restaurants”). For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated €1,016.8 million in Pro Forma Run-",9.2.1,,"Rate franchise sales and revenues and €318.8 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate Normalized EBITDA reflecting a 31.4% Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA margin. Our portfolio is diversified across cuisine styles and occasions and is operated mostly under a highly attractive franchise model through an efficient and synergistic platform. Our strength in identifying and responding to consumer preferences for cuisine, price point, format and channel through our various restaurant brand concepts has established us as a dominant player in the French food service industry. We have successfully scaled and grown our presence exponentially from 116 points of sale in 2010 to over 1,000 points of sale in 2023. In line with our continued growth, we have increased our SWS by a 12% CAGR over the 2019 to March 31, 2024 period. Our pace of growth is consistent, with between approximately 80 to 110 new restaurant openings every year over the 2019 to 2023 period and a strong pipeline of additional restaurant openings in the future. In recent years, our growth has been driven by the rapid expansion of our franchisee network through the opening of new franchise restaurants under both existing and newly developed or acquired brand concepts. We have namely experienced continued and steady growth with Burger King France (excluding Quick), the second largest QSR chain in France and for which we are the exclusive French master franchisee, representing approximately 51% of our restaurant network. As a result, we increased our total points of sale from 708 as of 1 ----- December 31, 2019 to 1,059 as of March 31, 2024, a large proportion of which was driven by growth in our franchised restaurants, increasing the total franchised portion of our restaurant network from 71% in 2019 to 83% on March 31. 2024. This growth had a strong corresponding impact on our _Pro Forma SWS, which increased from €1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2.8 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Our Pro Forma Adjusted Normalized EBITDA also increased from approximately €254 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, according to management estimates, to €307.4 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe our brand portfolio approach provides significant scale and synergies across brands, allowing us to capitalize on our market-leading capabilities, as illustrated by the successful roll-out of the Burger King brand in France to improve the performance of Bertrand Casual Foods’ current and future restaurant brands. Our operational model is well-established, historically successful and designed to be replicable across our existing and future restaurant brands. We facilitate a platform driven approach by leveraging our know-how and a synergistic approach to enhance brand operations and performance across all areas and stages of development. We have a historically proven ability to execute rapid roll-out and expansion through our in-house dedicated restaurant network development team, as well as to implement in-house processes for newcomer brands, which involves upgrading operations to meet our group-wide standards, transitioning into the franchised model, diversifying cuisine offerings and redefining brand concepts to resonate with current market preferences that we know well. These strategic initiatives were implemented to improve the financial performance and brand positioning of our existing brands allowing us to grow the proportion of franchised restaurants. This transition into our franchise operational model generates more profitability per restaurant, increasing the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) generated by each brand. For example, as part of Léon’s recent conversion into Léon Fish Brasserie, we redefined its concept and food offering to appeal to a younger and broader customer base, revamped its digital loyalty program to increase customer engagement, and accelerated restaurant openings under the franchise model. Together, these efforts contributed to an increase in ARS, evidenced by a 42% difference between the ARS of €1.2 million generated by Léon restaurants that are not yet converted and €1.7 million generated by the converted Léon Fish Brasserie restaurants, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2023. At the core of our success is our franchise model, which is strategically crafted to be both asset-light and cash generative. We have two principal types of franchise arrangements: Franchise with Lease Management, our franchise model through which we generate additional revenues from real estate lease fees from our franchisees, and Pure Franchise. By focusing the majority of our network on franchising rather than direct restaurant operations, we limit our exposure to the day-to-day fixed costs and investments typically associated with running food service establishments. Instead, these capital expenditure responsibilities are supported by our franchisees, who invest in the assets and infrastructure necessary to operate their locations. This approach allows us to concentrate on providing unparalleled franchisee support, brand stewardship and strategic growth initiatives. Our franchisees benefit from a proven business model that offers the potential for robust returns, while we capitalize on stable and predictable revenue streams through royalty fees, advertising fees and, in the case of Franchise with Lease Management, leasing fees. In turn, our franchisees are contractually required to adhere to the meticulously crafted brand standards for the restaurants they operate, the absence of which can result in termination of our contracts with them. Our model ensures a mutually beneficial partnership that drives collective success across our network of brands. We continue to strategically maintain and operate a limited number of selected directly-owned Company Restaurants, which represented 17% of our restaurant network as of the year ended December 31, 2023. This approach provides us with a platform to pilot new marketing, menu and omni-channel innovations before rolling them out across our franchise network. It also allows us to establish a benchmark of operational success through exemplary models for our franchisees to emulate, showcasing best practices in management, customer service and quality product. While operating a limited number of Company Restaurants will remain a key strategic part of our portfolio for these reasons, we expect the proportion of Company Restaurants in our restaurant network to decrease over time.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.1,"Attractive market in France with steady growth characteristics, under penetrated by brands and franchises","We believe that the French food service market benefits from strong and sustainable growth characteristics, demonstrating resilience through business cycles and the COVID-19 pandemic. With a market size valued at €49.6 billion in 2023, the French food service market has historically experienced a steady growth rate, and we believe that it has significant untapped potential, particularly for restaurant chains and franchise businesses. Notably, the share of meals eaten outside the home in France remains significantly below that of more mature markets (such as the United Kingdom). With the growing shift in consumer preferences in France favoring more frequent outof-home meals, we believe this supports France’s market potential and room for growth. The French consumer food service market historically grew at a CAGR of approximately 2% per year in the pre-COVID era between the years 2016 and 2019, growing from approximately €50.3 billion in 2016 to approximately €52.9 billion in 2019. Following a brief decline in market growth in 2020, whereby the market briefly contracted to approximately €30.8 billion in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the French food service market has since shown a strong recovery path, continuing to grow at an upward trajectory, reaching almost pre-COVID-19 levels. This recovery highlights the market’s resilience and the sector’s ability to adapt to changing market and consumer preferences, projecting a positive future growth trajectory. In the French food service industry, chains have historically been under-represented compared to independent establishments. However, this trend has accelerated in recent years, with the market share of foodservice chains increasing by over 9 percentage points, from 34% in 2019 to 43% in 2023. This evolution is driven by consumers’ growing preferences for the consistency, quality and diverse culinary experiences that chains are uniquely positioned to offer. The momentum behind chain restaurants is a reflection of deeper changes in consumer behavior and expectations, which we believe points towards continued growth and increased market penetration. Against this backdrop, we believe our food service franchising platform is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this momentum. Our business model, characterized by a diverse portfolio of well-established brands and a demonstrated operational framework that has historically expanded the brands that join our portfolio, positions us as a key player ready to seize the untapped potential within the evolving market. The demand for franchising, in particular, continues to grow, driven by entrepreneurs seeking to align with reputable brands that offer operational excellence, market agility, and strategic support. For example, the number of franchisees in France across various industries has grown by a CAGR of 5% from 1995 through 2023 to approximately 92,000 franchises overall. Further, we believe that there is room for growth in the number of franchisees in the food service sector, with 13% of the French food service sector represented by franchises as of 2023 (compared to 37% of the French grocery retail sector). We have already demonstrated our capacity to meet this demand, with an average annual growth of approximately 110 new franchise restaurants joining our network over the past three years. This significant growth potential for franchisors in the French food industry is underpinned by structural market trends and evolving consumer preferences, which we believe our portfolio brands effectively address. In particular, consumer trends have shown a shift in consumption habits, driven by a focus on convenient food options due to decreasing time available for cooking, a desire for new consumption occasions (from breakfast to dinner) across multiple channels (such as delivery), an increasing share of income allocated to out-of-home food purchases, and the generalization of company-subsidized lunch vouchers, which drive external food consumption. In addition, consumer tastes have evolved toward diverse and global cuisines, which include options for healthy food and gourmet products. Our portfolio responds to these evolving trends, encompassing a variety of eight wellpositioned distinct restaurant brands that cater to a wide range of attractive food service market segments, from QSR to casual dining eateries and addressing all-day consumption occasions across various channels. With the repositioning and modernizing of certain brands that joined our portfolio, such as Hippopotamus or Léon (see “— _Overview”), and the development of new products to meet consumer preference, such as the expanded veggie_ range of menu options for our Burger King brand, we have also demonstrated our ability to adapt our existing brands to evolving consumer needs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Our Burger King brand is the preferred QSR brand in the French market, with a market-leading net promoter score reflecting 96% brand awareness and digital presence. Since the reintroduction of Burger King in France in 2013, our outstanding performance has positioned France as the second-largest market for the Burger King brand globally, second only to the United States. This remarkable achievement was acknowledged with the “Franchisee of the Year” award at the Burger King World Convention in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our Burger King brand operations are best-in-class, with a robust franchising organization, local supply chain and omni-channel positioning. With a focus on building strong customer engagement through viral targeted marketing and a strong social media and mobile presence, we have significantly grown our presence in the digital market, and thus strengthened our market share, to include over 6 million Burger King active mobile app users globally as of March 31, 2024 and almost two million followers on social media across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X. The historical and continued success of Burger King within our portfolio underscores our significant presence in the competitive QSR market. Despite our current market leadership, there remains substantial whitespace for us to expand, particularly within the QSR segment. Compared to other countries, France remains a comparatively fragmented QSR market, with a lower number of QSR points of sale per 100,000 inhabitants as of 2023 compared, for example, to Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, indicating a significant opportunity for growth for restaurant chains to further consolidate and grow their share of the market. We aim to capitalize on untapped market segments and further strengthen Burger King’s position in the French QSR landscape. Specifically, we believe we are well positioned to reduce the total network size gap between Burger King and its primary competitor, McDonald’s, which currently maintains a larger store network, thereby presenting compelling growth potential. Our strategic focus on expanding our footprint, coupled with the existing market dynamics, positions us favorably to capture a larger share of the market and drive sustained growth. Our robust portfolio includes seven other unique brands, presented below (see “—Highly-replicable business _model with proven capacity to integrate and develop acquired brands”), each with its own distinct concept,_ contributing to our overall market strength and diversity. Our strong brand portfolio includes Au Bureau, one of the largest brasserie/pub brands in France with 79-81% of market share in the branded café-bars market, Hippopotamus, one of the largest networks of steakhouses in prime locations, Léon, one of the leading fish and seafood brands in France and Pitaya, a fast-casual restaurant chain with a strong network with international presence and 31-33% of market share. We strive to operate with a mix of brands that include well-known historic brands, new organically developed brands and international well-known brands debuting in France. These complementary brands span a variety of food service segments, including Asian QSR, Italian casual dining, pubs and brasseries, and seafood restaurants, among others. This multiplicity of brands not only enriches our offering but also enhances our resilience by diversifying our revenue streams and reducing dependency on a single market segment. The success of these brands, alongside Burger King, exemplifies our proven ability to develop, manage, and grow a wide range of restaurant concepts. Together, they form a robust foundation for our continued expansion and reinforce our position as a leader in the French restaurant franchising industry.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.3,Best-in-class operations supported by proven synergistic operational platform,"We believe our brand portfolio approach provides significant scale and synergies across brands, allowing us to capitalize on our market-leading capabilities to improve the performance of our current and future restaurant brands. The collective strength of our brands, underpinned by a shared operational framework, ensures efficiency, consistency, and innovation at every level of the franchising experience. We provide our franchisees with food service industry expertise throughout their relationship with us to enhance their success, from site selection of a 4 ----- new restaurant through continued operational support. Our franchisees also benefit from the ability to diversity cuisine formats and models across our brand portfolio, with the ability to cover a specific geographical area with different brands. One of the cornerstone capabilities of our platform is our strategic approach to network roll-out and site sourcing. We boast an in-house dedicated market-leading property team, with over 20 years of experience and deep local knowledge of the areas in which we wish to grow our operations. Leveraging advanced proprietary sourcing and market insights, we identify prime locations that promise high foot traffic and optimal visibility for our franchisees. In partnership with prime institutional real estate investors and with a robust development team consisting of approximately 60 full-time employees with national coverage, we are able to access some of the most attractive locations as tenant of choice to quickly and efficiently open new restaurants for any of the brands in our portfolio. As a result of our efficient methodology, we have opened 103 new restaurants on average from 2016 through 2023, which we believe reflects one of the largest roll-out plans of other key food service peers in Europe. In the realm of brand management, our expertise ensures that each brand maintains its unique identity while benefiting from cross-brand strategies to increase customer brand awareness and engagement. With decades of expertise running restaurants driven by an entrepreneurial management team, we provide an innovative approach to brand management to sync the dining experience of each of our brands with the distinct customer preferences that each brand is tailored to. We aim to modernize the historic brands in our portfolio, with a focus on product and customer experience, to upgrade their brand image and sync the dining experience with our knowledge of what customers seek. In the context of a rapidly evolving food service landscape, we have strategically positioned our restaurant brand franchise network at the forefront of digital innovation and delivery partnerships. Recognizing the growing consumer demand for convenience and speed, we have invested heavily in developing a robust digital infrastructure that encompasses user-friendly online ordering platforms, mobile apps with intuitive interfaces, and integrated loyalty programs. In 2023, approximately 88% of our restaurants offered delivery services, with approximately €210 million in SWS generated across our portfolio over the same period from delivery sales. This digital ecosystem is designed to enhance the customer experience, making it seamless for patrons to engage with our brands, place orders, and receive their favorite meals wherever they are. Furthermore, our advanced delivery capabilities, supported by partnerships with leading delivery services, ensure that we can meet the high expectations for promptness and quality. This comprehensive approach to digital and delivery services not only drives additional revenue streams but also strengthens the competitive edge of our franchise network, ensuring that our brands remain relevant and preferred in a market that increasingly values digital convenience and reliable delivery options.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.4,Highly compelling proposition for strong pool of vetted franchisees,"As of December 31, 2023, we partnered with over 420 franchisees across our restaurant brand network. Our franchise revenue model is based on the royalties and fees that we generate from our franchisees, which in turn are calculated on the basis of a percentage of their total SWS. As a result, our financial performance is inherently 5 ----- correlated to the sales performance of our franchisees and we engage in a meticulous new franchisee selection process to ensure that each franchisee in our network can uphold brand standards and deliver high-quality customer experience. For our Burger King brand, for example, we receive a high number of applications that we evaluate, with only about 7% of applications received ultimately approved to join our network. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 47% of our franchisee network operated more than one restaurant site. Based on precedent from our Burger King brand, we believe there is capacity to increase the number of restaurants per franchisee to more than 3 restaurants on average, providing growth potential for both new and existing franchisees. The largest franchisee within our network operates 12 restaurants, and we do not anticipate franchisees generally exceeding this level, ensuring a balanced and competitive franchise structure. Franchisees joining our network gain access to extensive benefits and expert support from a leading franchise system, positioning them for success from the outset of their franchise journey. At the core of these benefits is our commitment to providing best-in-class support, ensuring that every franchisee is well-equipped to thrive in the competitive food service industry. At the restaurant opening stage, franchisees benefit from up to six months of intensive training, laying a solid foundation for operational success. Our complete training support extends across each brand within the network, drawing on years of proven expertise in restaurant management. Additionally, franchisees gain access to financing partners with whom we have established historical relationships and are confident in our network’s robust operating track record. This comprehensive support system is designed to minimize the hurdles of starting a new business, ensuring franchisees are thoroughly equipped to meet market demands. Once operational, our restaurants have historically displayed attractive unit economics and rapid payback periods. Franchisees experience a rapid ramp-up on new openings (with a ramp-up period of less than a month for our Burger King brands and within three to six months for the other restaurant brands in our portfolio), thanks to our efficient operational model and the strong brand recognition of the brands in our portfolio. The network’s attractive cash management model enables franchisees to achieve rapid payback on their initial investment. Historically, franchisees have achieved payback for Burger King brand restaurants within three to four years, while franchisees for the rest of the brands in our portfolio (excluding Itsu and Pitaya) have achieved payback within four and a half to six years. Further, our Burger King brand restaurants typically generate approximately €3.8 million in ARS on average, while the other restaurants brands in our portfolio typically generate between approximately €0.8 million to €2.1 million in ARS, based on the same period. These attractive economics are bolstered by the attractive, adapted and flexible franchise terms that we offer franchisees under our different restaurant brands. We offer our franchisees two principal types of franchise arrangements: Franchise with Lease Management, our preferred franchise model for our Burger King brand, through which we generate additional revenues from real estate lease fees from our franchisees, and Pure Franchise, our preferred franchise model for the rest of the brands in our portfolio. Under the latter model, franchisees are able to own the business asset rights over the business. Each of our different brands also demand a different up-front equity investment, with Burger King brand requiring €250,000 up-front (of which €50,000 are entry fees) and the remainder of our brands requiring between €100,000 to €350,000 up-front, depending on the 6 ----- brand (of which €50,000 to €60,000 are entry fees). This flexibility allows franchisees to choose the brand and franchise model that best suits their business goals and financial abilities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.5,Asset-light business model with high cash conversion and limited exposure to restaurant operations,"Our successful franchise-based business model, supported by a robust network of committed franchise partners, generates recurring and predictable revenues with high EBITDA margin, with 15% of revenues from franchisees as a percentage of SWS and 28% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 83% of our network was represented by Franchise Restaurants, while approximately 17% was represented by Company Restaurants. As a large majority of our restaurants are Franchise Restaurants, we operate with a strategic advantage by being largely insulated from the day-to-day operational costs associated with running a restaurant. This arrangement, where individual franchisees are responsible for the direct expenses of their establishments, allows us to focus on overarching brand development, marketing strategies, and network expansion without the financial burden and complexities of daily restaurant management. Consequently, our financial model is characterized by reduced operational risk and a streamlined cost structure, enhancing our ability to invest in long-term growth initiatives and support our franchisees from a strategic vantage point. The table below demonstrates the key features of each of our restaurant models: Company Restaurants, Franchise with Lease Management and Pure Franchise. (1) Advertising contribution from franchisees is entirely spent in marketing campaigns to promote the brands nationally. (2) Under Franchise with Lease Management contracts, we pay occupancy costs for the ownership of the business asset rights. (3) MFA royalties are paid for brands that we do not directly owned (i.e., between 3.5 and 4.5% of SWS for Burger King and approximately 3% of SWS for Itsu). Our focus on building and expanding our franchise network centers around an asset-light approach, pursuant to which we do not own the land, building or physical assets of the restaurants within our network. We derive the benefits of this asset-light model under both types of our franchise arrangements. This asset-light model allows for higher cash conversion and reduces or eliminates for locations with third-party landlord agreements our capital 7 ----- expenditures for such franchise openings. We have a strong cash conversion (measured as pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA minus our capital expenditures divided by pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA) of over 80%. In the case of Franchise with Lease Management restaurants, we partner with a diverse base of real estate investor partners who own the land and buildings where our restaurants operate. These properties are then leased to us, following which we sub-lease the land to our franchisees under our Franchise with Lease Management Model, allowing us to retain ownership of the business goodwill. As such, we are able to generate lease management fees while reducing our capital burden. Our franchisees are thereafter responsible for ongoing capital expenditures related to equipment, kitchen, furniture and fixtures. We generally incur no capital expenditure for two-thirds of our openings under the Lease Management Model. Indeed, in 2023, 30 out of 44 Burger King France openings were executed using the asset-light Pure Franchise model. Our franchisees under our Pure Franchise model lease their restaurant locations directly from third-party landlords. They directly invest in the physical assets required to establish and operate their individual locations, bearing responsibility for all capital expenditures, including building and development. We incur no opening capital expenditure under the Pure Franchise model. The table below demonstrates our enhanced cash conversion shown by the Burger King Group between 2019 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, as a result of the growth in our franchise network. The table below summarizes our asset-light network development model. In addition, our franchise-based model allows us to retain strong control over our network through our standard agreements with our franchisees, which govern various aspects of our relationship, including the royalties and fees due by them to us. We believe that our franchise model offers us favorable upsides as well as an attractive contractual protection and that our emphasis on growing this model in the future will continue to drive high cash conversion.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.6,Highly-replicable business model with proven capacity to integrate and develop acquired brands,"Our strategic growth lies in our highly replicable business franchise model, which has demonstrated a proven capacity for integrating and developing a diverse array of brands. Since 2010, we have successfully acquired, integrated and developed a number of successful brands, with demonstrated substantial performance improvement. This model is built on a foundation of meticulous sourcing of potential acquisitions. Our experienced in-house M&A team has a demonstrated capacity to identify some of the most compelling concepts for consumers and 8 ----- franchisees that show promise in terms of market fit and growth potential, backed by a privileged access to deal flow thanks to our market positioning and reputation as the “buyer of choice.” Once a brand is incorporated into our portfolio, we apply our playbook for successful integration by implementing our in-house best practices and processes. With over 20 years of experience in network development, we work with newly acquired restaurant brands to upgrade their operational processes, such as reporting and analytics. We also plug them into our network of resource pooling, leveraging on existing support functions. This ensures that each brand is seamlessly integrated into our network, benefiting from our wealth of experience and established systems for operational excellence. Our approach is also committed to redefining brand concepts to ensure they resonate with current market trends and consumer preferences. This involves a thorough analysis of the brand's core identity and offerings, followed by strategic adjustments that enhance its appeal without losing its unique character. Our goal is to elevate each brand to its fullest potential in alignment with our brand standards by updating menu items, revamping marketing strategies, redesigning the customer experience or enhancing the omni-channel distribution offering to customers. Developing the franchise network is the final piece of our model. With the brand concept refined and best practices in place, we focus on expanding the franchise network through targeted recruitment of franchisees in line with our recruitment criteria. Our support for franchisees is comprehensive, encompassing training, marketing, supply chain logistics, and ongoing operational guidance. This ensures not only the rapid expansion of the franchise network but also the sustainability of each franchise under our umbrella.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.7,Seasoned management team with a proven track-record supported by shareholders experienced in our industry,"We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our senior management team, backed by our visionary founder, Olivier Bertrand. Olivier Bertrand, our board chairman, founded Groupe Bertrand in 1997 and has since been closely associated with our image, development and operations. Under his guidance, the Group has significantly transformed the franchise restaurant industry in France by developing existing brands and tremendously increasing their presence throughout the entire French territory. Our senior management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Christophe Gaschin, who joined the Group in 2016 and previously worked as a business lawyer with the Paris Bar for almost 17 years as a partner at major international law firms. Our Chief Financial Officer, Xavier Cottineau, joined the Group in September 2016 after serving as Chief Financial Officer at Financière Louis, as Finance Vice President at EuroDisney and senior financial auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our experienced management team has a long and successful history with a proven track record of developing, integrating and operating in the QSR and casual dining segment and has managed to lead our Group through evolutions to its business model, support our Group's growing network (including its franchise growth trajectory) and execute M&A transactions to further our business strategies.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.1,Expand our brand portfolio and franchise restaurant network to profitably increase our market share,"We believe there is significant untapped demand for franchised brands across France and internationally in Europe, supporting the potential to continue our successful expansion strategy. We plan to employ a dynamic strategy to expand the number of brands in our portfolio that can be franchised, leveraging both acquisitions and organic brand development as pivotal growth drivers. Through targeted M&A activities, we plan to strategically acquire brands that complement our existing portfolio, offering new concepts that respond to local consumer demand or enhancing our geographical footprint through increased network density. This approach allows us to rapidly scale our network, bringing in established brands with loyal customer bases and proven business models. Concurrently, we plan to continue to invest in the organic development of new brands, nurturing innovative 9 ----- concepts from the ground up to address emerging market trends and consumer demands. This dual strategy of external growth through acquisitions and internal growth through brand innovation ensures a continuous pipeline of fresh and diverse offerings within our franchise network. We also plan to further expand our restaurant network in collaboration with current and new franchisees to continue to increase our market share in France. We expect that a higher density of restaurants will further contribute to brand awareness, support customer loyalty and increase traffic in our existing restaurants, while our new restaurants will benefit from existing strong brands, reputation and know-how. We have a rigorous approach to expansion and expect to promote new restaurant growth primarily through opening Franchise with Lease Management restaurants for our Burger King brand, allowing us to maintain significant control over our network with limited capital expenditure. For the other brands in our network, we will focus on opening predominantly Pure Franchise restaurants, which further reduce our capital expenditures. With regard to Company Restaurants, these require significantly higher capital expenditures and introduces additional leases and personnel costs to our cost structure compared to franchise arrangements; consequently, we intend to limit the number of new Company Restaurants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.2,Continue to take advantage of attractive market fundamentals,"We intend to continue leveraging our extensive and prime-location restaurant network and existing broad franchise network. We also seek to expand the product offerings in our existing restaurants to continue to tailor our offerings to evolving customer preferences by relying on our expertise in creating innovative, premium convenience food products that match customers’ demand, which we believe will be a key driver of our revenues. For example, we intend to continue to expand our healthy and nutritious product offering through the introduction of additional healthy options and preservative-free ingredients to further capture key markets, such as families, and anticipate market trends toward local sourcing, value-for-money products and healthy food options as well as meatless alternatives and products with no animal protein. We also plan to further strengthen our multi-channel approach through the enhancement of takeaway options and the development of new digital sales channels to further drive our growth. Finally, we intend to capitalize on increased consumption opportunities by the continued operation of our restaurants in the afternoon or late-night hours. We are also committed to continuing to capitalize on the inherent synergies within our diverse portfolio of brands. By leveraging shared resources, expertise, and operational efficiencies across our network, we aim to enhance the value proposition for our franchisees and deliver a superior experience to our customers. This includes optimizing our supply chain logistics, unifying marketing efforts to amplify brand visibility for each of the brands in our portfolio, and fostering innovation through the cross-pollination of ideas and best practices among our brands. Our commitment to harnessing these synergies not only drives operational excellence and cost savings but also positions us to respond more dynamically to market changes and consumer trends. We will remain focused on identifying and exploiting new opportunities for synergy, ensuring that our collective strength continues to be a cornerstone of our competitive advantage and growth strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We plan to continue to make improvements to our existing digital sales channels in order to maintain and increase our digital sales, while also developing additional innovative and convenient digital capabilities. While we have already successfully integrated the use of in-app orders and preorders, Click & Collect orders, in-store tablets that allow customers to skip the line and home delivery options with third-party aggregators for our Burger King brand, we also see opportunity in expanding our digital channels for the other brands in our network. Following the positive growth of these initiatives with the Burger King brand, we plan to replicate this model across our entire brand portfolio. Additionally, we have recently acquired The Original Food Court, a proprietary technology that enables customers to order seamlessly from all our brands, creating a “digital food court.” Our commitment to innovation in the omni-channel space positions our brands as industry leaders, providing convenience and accessibility to customers while promoting growth and profitability for our franchise partners. We believe that the current trends and growth observed in our digital sales, accelerated as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate a distribution channel that adapts to the changing preferences of our customers and is complementary to our in-restaurant dining channel.

Our key strategic ESG pillars include: (i) adapting our product offering to address future global challenges, (ii) promoting the well-being of our teams and (iii) limiting our environmental impact. With respect to our product offering, we intend to continue to promote local and quality product sourcing, innovate our offer to provide healthy and responsible food options (for example, for our Burger King brand, through a full permanent range of plant-based burgers, wraps, salads and sandwiches without animal protein) and apply stringent safety standards to our operations. In promoting the well-being of our teams, our goal is to create an inclusive workplace with frequent staff trainings and an emphasis on fighting against harassment.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Strategy,9.4.5,Focus on cost control and economies of scale,"We intend to continue to improve our gross margin and profitable expansion through leveraging our Bertrand Franchise platform to generate cost optimization, particularly for our supply chain and marketing. By streamlining these critical areas, we aim to achieve significant efficiencies and cost reductions that directly benefit our bottom line and enhance the profitability of our franchise network. While franchisees bear the food and logistic costs for their restaurants, we organize and negotiate the sourcing for both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants through pre-approved suppliers and relationships with certain third-party logistics providers. Our food and logistics costs are significant, and we believe that we could drive restaurants’ gross margin through enhanced control of our logistics costs by exploiting economies of scale in line with the growth of our restaurant network, further developing local supplier networks and implementing cost control measures to reduce food waste. For example, we require all of our Burger King franchisees to source their raw materials from suppliers that BKC has previously approved and with whom we intend to continue to leverage our extensive restaurant network and economies of scale to obtain favorable commercial terms. In addition, suppliers have sought to invest in long-term partnerships with us, which has allowed us to reduce food costs and secure dedicated product lines to satisfy our needs. Apart from focusing on the optimization of our supply chain, we intend to further develop our communication and advertising campaigns to promote our brands, product offerings and commercial offers in order to reinforce awareness of our brands, build on their existing brand image and increase customer traffic, which we believe will also contribute to the improvement of our gross margin and profitable expansion.

Where possible, in the case of Franchise with Lease Management restaurants, we will also favor third party landlord agreements allowing us to effectively reduce our new opening capex spend to nothing with new openings under the asset-light model lease management.

In order to facilitate the Refinancing, and immediately prior to the Refinancing and the Issue Date, the Parent will contribute and sell all of its assets and liabilities to the Issuer (collectively, the “Reorganization Transactions”), so that, as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and effective as of the Issue Date, (A) the Parent’s only asset will be the shares of the Issuer and (B) the Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, all the subsidiaries of the Group. See “Summary—The Reorganization Transactions” and “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions”. (3) The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness and will rank senior to all of the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. Within 60 days after the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Midco GB, Burger King France, Burger King Restauration, Financière BKF, France BKR, Groupe Flo and BK Invest France (herein referred to and previously defined as the “Guarantors”). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors generated 80.4% of the Group’s _Pro Forma EBITDA and, as of December 31, 2023, directly held 58.3% of the Group’s total assets, in each case net of intercompany eliminations. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles which are summarized in “Description of the Notes—Security”, (a) on the Issue Date, the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral on a first-ranking basis, which will include a firstranking pledge over the shares of the Issuer and certain other assets of the Issuer; and (b) within 60 days after the Issue Date, the 13 ----- Guarantors’ obligations under the Indenture will be secured by the Post-Closing Collateral on a first-ranking basis, which will include certain assets of the Guarantors (as defined above). See “Description of the Notes—Security”. The Collateral will also secure the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement substantially simultaneously with the same collateral granted to secure the obligations under the Notes on a super senior basis pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein). In the event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or certain distressed sales, lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds from enforcement or such distressed sales in priority to the Notes. The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to contractual and legal limitations that may materially limit their enforceability, and the Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the _Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral”._ (4) On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to provide for a revolving credit facility in an amount of €165.0 million. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be made available for drawing as of the Issue Date to the Issuer and certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that may become borrowers under the New Revolving Credit Facility, for general corporate and working capital purposes. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed within 60 days after the Issue Date by the Guarantors. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be secured substantially simultaneously with the same collateral granted to secure the obligations under the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility.” Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility as well as certain hedging counterparties will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for more information. We expect that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on_ the Issue Date. (5) The Issuer will use the gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes primarily to (a) repay indebtedness of the Group, (b) pay makewhole amounts and other pre-payment costs and (c) pay the costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing. Proceeds from the Notes issuance may be subsequently lent to other subsidiaries of the Issuer. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Description _of the Notes— The Proceeds Loans.”_ (6) The Issuer holds majority interests in a number of non-guarantor operating entity subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent generated 19.1% of the Group’s Pro Forma EBITDA and, as of December 31, 2023, directly held 33.3% of the Group’s consolidated total assets, in each case net of intercompany eliminations. (7) The entities in the “Restricted Group” are subject to the covenants in the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. 14 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The Issuer, which is fully owned by the Parent and which will, as of the Issue Date, own all of the assets and liabilities currently owned by the Parent, does not produce consolidated financial statements. We present in this Offering Memorandum certain consolidated financial information for the Parent and its subsidiaries, as well as certain consolidated financial information for Burger King France S.A.S. and its subsidiaries. The Parent is as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and will remain after the Issue Date, a holding company that conduct no business operations of its own and has no significant assets other than the equity interests and/or the intercompany receivables it hold in each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The material differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of the Parent on a standalone basis under IFRS and the rest of the Group represents mainly (i) a standalone net current liabilities (excluding cash) of €2.8 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalents of €1.1 million, (iii) a positive standalone EBITDA equal to €0.2 million and (iv) a net financial income of €0.6 million. The material differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 of the Parent on a standalone basis under IFRS and the rest of the Group represents mainly (i) a standalone net current liabilities (excluding cash) of €3.1 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalents of €0.0 million, (iii) a positive standalone EBITDA for the Parent equal to €1.4 million and (iv) a net financial expenses of €(21.8) million.

Based on the changes to their operating models during the period, we applied these calculations to one Burger King Company Restaurant which transferred into a Franchise Restaurant under Lease Management and two Burger King Franchise Restaurants which transferred into Company Restaurants over the year ended December 31, 2023. (f) Represents, in order to account for contractual changes in lease management rates for our Franchise Restaurants (i.e., as a result of progressive rates applied according to the year of openings), the amount of franchise revenues generated by the lease management rate of these franchise restaurants with changed lease management rates during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, and then apply the lease management rates under the current franchise agreements as of December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024, respectively.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.1,"We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business and financial results may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive pressures.","The restaurant industry in France is highly competitive. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants. We compete primarily with other well-established restaurant franchisors operating in the QSR or CDR space (such as Yum!, Napaqaro, Le Duff, McDonald’s and Holder) on the basis of the quality and strength of our franchise network and the quality of restaurant brands within our portfolios (measured on the basis of product choice, food quality, affordability, service offered, location and condition of restaurant network). The vitality of our brand portfolio is closely tied to our ability to attract and retain franchisees to operate the restaurants in our brand portfolio who are not only qualified, but also motivated to uphold the standards we set for our brands. These franchisees are the linchpin of our network, playing a crucial role in delivering the quality and service that customers expect from our brands. We face competition in attracting and retaining qualified and motivated franchisees to operate the restaurants in our brand portfolio. Our competitors may be able to offer greater resources and benefits to their franchisees (for example, in terms of lower franchise royalties, advertising programs, greater training and more extensive franchise support), which may enable them to attract and retain franchisees more effectively than we can. Further, our competitors’ size, resources and business model may allow them to better deploy their strategic initiatives across their franchisee network (including across the areas of marketing, product development and overall quality of operations). In addition to competing on the basis of the strength of our franchise network, our food service competitors may have well-integrated, developed and high-quality international, national or regional QSR and/or CDR restaurant chains in their portfolios, which could draw our customers to their restaurants, negatively impacting the performance of the restaurant brands within our portfolio. We carefully select the restaurant brands in our portfolios to address specific QSR and CDR consumer preferences. While the strategic diversity of the brands in our portfolio is intended to protect us from being significantly exposed to the financial performance of any one of our individual brands, we are still subject to the risk that any one of our restaurant brands may lose market share to well established companies or new entrants, which could have an impact on our financial performance. For example, Burger King, the largest restaurant brand in our portfolio, competes predominantly with McDonald’s, which has a substantially larger and denser network in France. McDonald’s, through its French master franchisee, is a well-established branded chain that has substantially greater financial resources, higher revenue and greater economies of scale than Burger King does. This significantly greater size may enable McDonald’s to negotiate lower prices than Burger King can from its suppliers (for example, in respect of raw 36 ----- materials) or better absorb increases in its cost base (for example, due to inflation of raw material prices and increases in labor, rental and other operating costs). McDonald’s also spends significant amounts on advertising, marketing and other promotional activities, which may give it a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. In addition, McDonald’s and other QSR competitors may be able to deploy greater resources in order to accelerate restaurant openings and refurbishment efforts, to rapidly expand their offer of new products or to implement aggressive product discounting, all of which could give it a competitive advantage over Burger King. Under challenging economic conditions, the competitive advantages resulting from greater financial resources and economies of scale may intensify, thereby permitting McDonald’s or other competitors to gain market share. If Burger King is unable to maintain its competitive position, it could experience reduced royalty payments from franchise restaurants, as well as reduced margins and revenue from company restaurants, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The restaurant industry has few barriers to entry for opening one or numerous points of sale and therefore new restaurant brands may emerge at any time, competing with the restaurant brands in our portfolio. Existing international and national chains may also take market share as they strengthen their position and expand their points of sale in France. Further, we also compete with certain segments of the food industry, such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in grocery stores, as well as online food options from our competitors through ordering services platforms such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. Existing competition is intensified by these delivery aggregators and food delivery service providers, which give consumers convenient access to a broad range of competing restaurant chains and food retailers. The rapid evolution of the competitive landscape, particularly in light of the growing popularity of online food ordering and delivery platforms, requires a commitment to continued innovation. The location of our restaurants has significant influence on their success, and therefore the market for suitable restaurant locations is highly competitive and QSR and CDR companies, restaurant chains and other retail companies compete for prime real estate sites. We cannot assure you that current locations will continue to be economically viable or that additional locations can be acquired at reasonable costs. In addition, the economic environment where restaurants are located could decline in the future, which could result in reduced sales for those locations. We cannot assure you that new sites will be profitable or as profitable as existing sites. Under our existing Company Restaurant and Franchise with Lease Management models, we continue to lease locations for restaurant sites across all of our brands (see “—We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount _of space, including future increases in occupancy costs”). As a result of their size advantage and/or their greater_ financial resources, some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable commercial lease terms than we can, which could reduce our margins, and some landlords and developers may offer priority or grant exclusivity to some of our competitors for desirable locations, which could increase their competitive edge. As a result, we may not be able to obtain leases for new restaurant brands in our portfolio or renew leases for existing restaurants on acceptable terms, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to expand our franchise restaurant network (either through existing franchisees opening new restaurants or by attracting new franchisees) and to strengthen and continue to develop the quality and value of the restaurant brands within our portfolio, by in turn developing and rolling out new products and product line extensions, executing successfully advertising and marking programs, effectively responding to consumer preferences and managing the complexity of restaurant operations. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience a loss of quality franchisees in our network, downward pressure on prices, lower demand for the products offered by our restaurant brands, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.2,"We are exposed to macroeconomic and other trends that could adversely impact consumer spending, and are particularly dependent on the health of the French economy, as the sole country in which we operate.","Our revenue and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending, which is primarily influenced by macroeconomic and other drivers influencing consumer-spending behavior, such as employment levels, salary and wage levels, inflation or deflation, interest rates, tax rates, availability of consumer credit, 37 ----- consumer confidence with respect to current and future overall economic conditions and personal economic prospects, all of which are factors beyond our control. As all of the restaurants within our portfolio are currently concentrated in France, we have a heightened exposure to local economic conditions. As a result, any deterioration in the French economy could have a significant effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. According to INSEE, French GDP grew by 6.4% in 2021 (reflecting a rebound from the significant decrease in GDP in 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), 2.5% in 2022 and 0.9% in 2023. While French GDP demonstrated growth over recent years, this growth could be attributed to recovered consumer confidence following the extreme deterioration of GDP during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may not be sustainable. There is no guarantee that GDP will continue its upward trajectory if this growth plateaus, stabilizing to pre-pandemic levels, or if other macro-economic trends bear a negative impact on future periods. Further, a global economic downturn or other worldwide geopolitical events may also have an adverse impact on consumer confidence in France. Recent examples of such events include the COVID-19 pandemic, which spurred a global economic downturn that negatively impacted consumer confidence and fostered more price conscious spending, including in France. In addition, beginning in 2022, the Russian-Ukrainian war has resulted in threats to the development of the global economy, including by way of increasing inflationary pressures that have an impact on consumer spending. Recent hostilities in the Middle East could also have a significant negative impact on the global economic outlook, which could in turn impact the individual consumption decisions of our customers in France. Any significant deterioration in current macroeconomic conditions, particularly those which have a negative impact in France, could have an adverse effect on our business, growth prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.3,"Our business, results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, natural disasters or catastrophic events.","Unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, war activities, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, natural disasters, sustained episodes of inclement weather or other catastrophic events can adversely impact restaurant sales and may discourage our customers from dining out, thereby reducing footfall to our restaurant brands. Such events, even when outside of France, could dampen consumer spending among French consumers, reduce footfall and prevent the restaurants in our brand portfolio from operating at peak capacity or cause disruptions to our supplies. Because a significant portion of restaurant operating costs are fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of revenue following such events harms our operating margins and can result in operating losses. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled us and our franchisees to adjust restaurant operations, manage customer flow, and enhance delivery and pickup services, with supply chain disruptions causing potential delays and shortages. These changes, along with a lasting shift in consumer preferences towards delivery services, could have enduring effects on our industry, business, results of operations, and financial condition. To support our franchisees throughout the evolution of COVID-19 restrictions, we agreed to implement certain temporary royalty adjustments, which resulted in reduced revenues from our franchisees during this period. Further, as lessors of the restaurant premises under our Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with the landlords of such restaurants as their revenues decreased during this period. We cannot guarantee that we will not need to provide similar support in the future to maintain operations during unforeseen events. In addition, other developments, such as strikes, boycotts, traffic blockades, both nationally and in areas in which the restaurants in our portfolio operate, social and economic instability, civil disturbances, government-imposed lockdowns, or similar events, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, between November 2018 through January 2021, our operations in France were adversely impacted by the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) protest movement in France, which caused intermittent traffic blockades and transportation disruptions, particularly in downtown areas, limiting foot traffic and access to restaurants in certain peak urban areas. More recently, in early 2024, agricultural unions in France organized a series of protests and 38 ----- road blockades on major roads in France. While such protests have largely diminished in response to government concessions, any such future protect could pose a risk to our supply chain continuity and restaurant operations. Any continued or resurgent social and political uncertainty may expose us to greater risks of interruption of our operations. Further, our security costs may rise and footfall in our stores may suffer as a result of any adjacent incidents of social unrest or violence. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. Prolonged disruptions of our operations due to natural disasters, civil unrest or other catastrophic events, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have insurance policies in place, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events and any losses that could result from such events in the future. Terrorist attacks in France and abroad, as well as war and threats of war or actual conflicts involving France or other countries, may dramatically and adversely impact the economy of France and cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, following the COVID-19 pandemic, most insurance companies have begun to exclude pandemics from their insurance coverage of operating losses. To the extent we renew our insurance coverage or face a subsequent pandemic, our insurance coverage of the negative impact on our operating losses would no longer be subject to coverage.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We do not own the Burger King brand, and we are therefore highly dependent on the franchisor, BK Europe and its ultimate parent, Burger King Corporation (“BKC”). Moreover, the Master Franchise Agreement contains certain undertakings, and failure to reach certain restaurant opening milestones may result in fines or early termination in certain circumstances. If the Master Franchise Agreement were terminated, we would not be able to continue to expand the Burger King network and realize anticipated economies of scale, although we would be able to continue to operate the existing Burger King network under certain conditions. The early termination of the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot control or influence the actions of BK Europe as master franchisor, and BK Europe may take actions that could harm our operation of Burger King brand restaurants. For example, BK Europe may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Certain actions taken by BK Europe, including those involving the Burger King brand, may adversely affect our business operations such as BKC requiring its franchisees to adopt a product offering that we do not believe would be popular with consumers in France. Moreover, if BK Europe does not adequately protect the Burger King brand and other intellectual property rights, Burger King’s brand perception could deteriorate in France and our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe, Burger King is required to comply with operational programs established by the master franchisor. For example, the Master Franchise Agreement requires that our Burger King restaurants comply with specified design criteria. In addition, the master franchisor generally has the right to require us to remodel Burger King restaurants to conform to the then-current image of Burger King, which may require the expenditure of considerable funds. Failure to conform to these requirements could constitute a breach of the Master Franchise Agreement, which could adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.5,Consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to food consumption may continue to change and we may be unable to adapt to such changes,"Our business is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to both drink and food, as well as demographic trends over time. If we fail to tailor the restaurant brands in our portfolio to respond to customers’ evolving preferences, we may not be able to sustain or increase customer traffic and we may lose our market share to our competitors. While the restaurant brands in our portfolio cater to different consumer preferences through diverse cuisine types, price points, formats and channels, our overall success depends on the continued appeal of such brands in the context of rapidly evolving consumer preferences. In particular, the QSR segment is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products, often supported by substantial promotional campaigns, and is subject to changing consumer preferences, tastes, and eating and purchasing habits. Any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond to trends in consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Customers have become increasingly concerned with making health-conscious dining choices, as well as the provenance of locally sourced ingredients, which impacts all of the restaurant brands in our portfolio, but in particular has a strong impact on the product options available in our QSR restaurant brands. If we do not rapidly and adequately respond to prevailing health or dietary preferences and perceptions, consumers may avoid our restaurant brands, particularly our QSR brands, in favor of alternative food options, which could cause our business to suffer. In addition, negative publicity about the options that our restaurant brands offer could adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In recent years, numerous restaurant concepts have introduced products positioned to capitalize on the growing consumer preference for food products that are, or are perceived to be, healthy, nutritious and low in calories, sodium and fat content or that meet other nutritional criteria, such as gluten-free, vegetarian or vegan. Our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences, tastes and eating and purchasing habits by adapting the restaurant brands in our portfolio to respond to these changes and our franchisees adequately adapting these changes. Responding to such shifts in consumer preferences could entail specific costs. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to respond to these or other trends in consumer preference by introducing changes to our formats, brands, drink and food offerings and premises or otherwise. In addition, consumers are increasingly reliant on food delivery services. This trend was significantly accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustained consumer reliance on food delivery services could have longterm effects on our operations. In France, the food delivery service industry is predominantly concentrated among a few key players, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. A sustained increase in our consumers’ preference for food delivery has made us reliant on the few main delivery aggregators. Further, purchases made through third-party delivery aggregators require the payment of an additional fee to such third-party aggregators, increasing our overall costs. In the long-term, we may need to raise our prices to recoup the additional delivery fees, or alternatively reduce our margins. Our business is significantly influenced by the evolving preferences and perceptions of consumers, not only regarding the products we offer but also the channels through which they access them. As trends shift, there is an increasing expectation for a variety of dining options, including home delivery, eat-in, click & collect, drive-through, and take-away services. Our restaurant brands must adeptly develop and balance these offerings to meet the diverse needs of our customers. The failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences for product offerings or service modalities could result in a decline in customer patronage. Any such eventuality could reduce our sales or have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. If our competitors are more innovative than we are, if we fail to appropriately respond to changes in consumer preferences and perceptions or if prevailing health or diet preferences cause customers to avoid our restaurants brands, in particular our QSR restaurant brands, in favor of foods that are perceived to be healthier, we may fail to retain existing, or attract new, customers. Any failure to retain existing, or attract new, customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 40 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

However, food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, listeria, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow disease”, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. New illnesses resistant to existing precautions or diseases with long incubation periods may develop in the future, such as mad cow disease, which could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Risks to the health of our customers can arise from our supply and logistics chain, which we do not control, and at our Company Restaurant and Franchise Restaurant locations. We rely on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to supply ingredients used in the preparation of the meals our restaurant brands sell, including sauces, meat and fresh produce. Although such third parties are subject to regulations, including food safety and environmental regulations, such regulations may not prevent such third parties from experiencing problems related to food safety and hygiene. Further, although we aim to work with the highest quality suppliers by pre-approving a limited number of suppliers that work with our restaurant brands, we do not control such suppliers and cannot guarantee that food safety related risks will not materialize. As a result, our reliance on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple restaurant brands and locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. In addition, although we maintain operational controls and provide employee and franchisee training aimed at preventing food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues, we can provide no assurance that these measures will be sufficient. Moreover, we are increasingly reliant on food delivery aggregators to deliver food from our restaurants to the customers, which may increase the risk that food- or beverage-borne illness incidents and food safety issues could be caused by factors outside of our control. Any report or publicity linking us, one of our franchisees, any of our brand restaurants in France or, in the case of our brands that also have international operations, restaurants in other countries, to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect any of the brands in our portfolio, along with our revenue and profits. Outbreaks of disease, including influenza, or the continued emergence of COVID-19 variants, could reduce footfall in our restaurants. If customers were to become ill from food-borne or hygiene-related illnesses, we or our franchisees could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants and, more significantly, our reputation and the reputation of our brands could be damaged, which could result in a decline in sales, thereby negatively affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, failure by any of our third-party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to comply with regulations, allegations of compliance failure, claims of intentional or negligent contamination of ingredients and raw materials or prolonged and intense negative publicity may disrupt their operations and result in a disruption of our food supply. Disruption of our third-party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners’ operations could in turn reduce or impair our supply of ingredients or other raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk is heightened in the case of our restaurant brands that rely on the supply pooling that we facilitate, as a reduction in supply from any one of our supply pool suppliers that provides products for multiple restaurant brands could have an impact across multiple restaurant brand operations. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring at restaurants of competitors could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of negative publicity about the food service industry generally. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of ingredients, which could result in supply chain disruptions, significantly increasing our costs and/or lowering margins for us and our franchisees. In addition, our industry has long been subject to the threat of food tampering by suppliers, employees or guests, such as the addition of foreign objects in the food that we sell. We cannot guarantee that our operational controls and employee training will be effective in preventing food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues that may affect our restaurants. Reports of alleged injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of restaurant chains and could negatively affect us in the future as well. 41 ----- In addition, the QSR industry is currently under heightened journalistic, legislative and regulatory scrutiny stemming from the perception that some QSR products have contributed to widespread medical problems, such as obesity and diabetes. See “—The growing concern about obesity and personal health may affect our sales.” Compliance with consumer health laws and regulations, such as those regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items, may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if such laws and regulations change significantly, our QSR restaurant brands may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and the higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes may reduce our margins. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu accordingly. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions, as well as on the QSR industry in general.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Brand value is partly based on consumer perceptions of a variety of subjective qualities, some of which we may have limited or no control over. Isolated or repeated events that originate from us, our franchisees or suppliers, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation. For example, our restaurant brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers and distributors, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. The reputation of our restaurant brands can also be negatively impacted if consumers perceive that we or our franchisees have acted in an unethical, illegal, biased or socially irresponsible manner. Further, entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct, including alleged human rights abuses, which damages the reputation of the brands in our portfolio. Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in, or negatively affect the perception of, our restaurant brands, decreasing the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our restaurants, which could result in lower revenue and profits. We may not always be able to control the occurrence and mitigation of such incidents that create a negative impact on our brands’ reputation. Additionally, our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or representative. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material impact on the financial performance of any of our restaurant brands, which could in turn have a negative impact on our overall financial performance and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

With respect to the Burger King brand, we pre-approve a limited number of suppliers, while logistics are managed by QSR Logistics. For the rest of our brands, we pre-approve a limited number of key product suppliers for each brand and have also put into place supply pooling systems for products used by multiple brands (such as beverage and packaging), with logistics of key products managed through third parties, mainly Transgourmet and Sysco. As a result, we are dependent on the third parties that provide supply, logistics and distribution services to our brands to ensure smooth restaurant operations across our entire business. This select group of third parties, while ensuring consistency and quality, also present a vulnerability. Any issues that arise with these third parties, such as a disruption due to economic, environmental, or political factors, could hamper 42 ----- our restaurant brands’ ability to provide their respective signature dining experiences, which could result in fewer sales and have a negative impact on our financial performance. This risk is heightened in connection with the supplies secured through our supply-pooling platform. While the decision to pool the procurement of certain supplies across brands streamlines the supply of key materials and provides cost saving advantages, it also creates a risk that any issue, shortage or delay of materials secured through the supply pooling platform will have a negative impact on multiple brands across our portfolio. While we may in the future choose to certify additional suppliers in order to diversify our raw material sourcing or to replace our existing suppliers, such certifications may take longer than anticipated to obtain. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate suppliers that meet our certification requirements quickly. Any difficulty in locating an adequate number of such certified suppliers could affect our restaurants’ operations and market position, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we negotiate contract renewals where desirable, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining renewals of our existing contracts with our suppliers on the same or similar terms, or at all. Failure to timely agree renewals with our suppliers and distributors, termination of these agreements or a variation of its terms could cause distribution or supply disruptions and could increase costs if we are required to find alternative suppliers and distributors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, the lack of direct control over these third-party suppliers and logistics providers adds another layer of complexity to our risk management. We require the suppliers that service our restaurant brands to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the high quality of our products. If the products provided by our suppliers do not meet the relevant quality standards, our reputation may be adversely affected.

The type, variety, quality, source and price of beef, chicken, produce and cheese, namely, can be subject to change due to factors beyond our control, including fluctuations in commodities markets, governmental agricultural policies, macroeconomic conditions, seasonality factors, demand levels, health regulations, customs barriers, taxes and tariffs (including as a result of trade disputes), inflationary conditions, labor shortages, transportation issues, food safety warnings, the operations of suppliers, political upheavals, energy costs and unforeseen events, such as severe weather conditions (which may be exacerbated by climate change). In the event of a supply disruption, a rise in commodities prices or other adverse event that affects our sources, our food, fuel and electricity or logistics costs could materially increase. Increases in prices or scarcity of ingredients or packaging materials required for the food served by our restaurant brands could increase our costs and disrupt our operations. Volatility in global food and drink prices and energy costs can have a negative impact on our operating margins. Although we have procedures in place to anticipate changes in the cost of certain raw materials used in the preparation of our products, any increase in the cost of the ingredients used in our products that cannot be transferred to our customers could affect our results of operations. If supplies of these materials become scarce or prices otherwise increase significantly and remain high for an extended period of time, there can be no assurance that we would be able to pass on any or all of the effects of such price increases to our customers, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If the third-party aggregators that we utilize for delivery, including marketplace and delivery as a service, cease or curtail their operations, fail to maintain sufficient labor force to satisfy demand, provide poor customer service, materially change fees, access or visibility to our products, or give greater priority or promotions to our competitors, our reputation, business and/or growth prospects may be negatively impacted. Further, we face the risk that these third-party delivery aggregators do not comply with existing regulations governing fair labor practices, which increases the risk of negative publicity for us, our franchisees and our restaurant brands. In addition, third-party delivery services typically charge restaurants a per order fee, and as such utilizing third-party delivery services may not be as profitable as sales directly to our customers, and may also introduce food quality and customer satisfaction risks outside of our control. These digital ordering and payment platforms also could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, other forms of sabotage, inclement weather or natural disasters and have experienced interruptions and could experience further interruptions, which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms or make customers less inclined to return to such platforms.

We have observed a heightened awareness around the environmental impact of food and a corresponding shift toward more sustainable and plant-based dietary choices. This risk is heightened in the case of certain of the brands within our portfolio, such as Burger King, Hippopotamus and Au Bureau, whose menus tend to include a large number of animal products and whose brand images are associated with beef options. We have in recent years invested in the development and roll-out of menu options that offer alternatives to animal products in order to cater to these eco-conscious preferences, aiming to reduce our environmental footprint and meet customer expectations. Despite these initiatives, if we do not rapidly adapt to these changing preferences or if our competitors more adequately respond to such industry trends, we could lose customer patronage, which could impact our revenue.

Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, lenders and other market participants are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed 44 ----- increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments and consumer choices. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. Notably, the ESG regulations to which we are subject are rapidly evolving. See “—We are subject to _health, safety and environmental regulations, which could result in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation.”_ We have adopted certain practices and policies to align our ESG approach with our strategy in order to deliver long-term social, environmental and economic values across our business. See “Business—ESG & Sustainability.” While we have in place robust ESG processes for most of our brands, our ESG procedures are still in the process of development and implementation for certain of our more recently acquired brands. We have developed internal processes to track, aggregate and disclose our ESG procedures and standards, however such processes require significant management time and attention. Even though many of the ESG procedures we have in place are robust, comply with market expectations and in certain cases go beyond legal requirements, if we do not adequately disclose our ESG procedures, we may be perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues. Further, our stakeholders may look to us to implement more or different ESG procedures, standards or goals in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us, or before they make further investments in us. We may also face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. We are also subject to evolving environmental regulations, the implementation of which may be costly and time-consuming. See “We are subject to health, safety and _environmental regulations, which could result in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation”. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so_ that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies or such constituencies might not be satisfied with our efforts or the speed of adoption of ESG practices or polices. If we do not meet our stakeholders’ expectations or we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, trust in our brand may suffer and our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. These limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing such capital markets. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may also impair our ability to service our indebtedness.

As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where such restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenue in those locations, which could have an impact on franchisee royalties and our margins. In addition, opening new restaurants that adapt to the customer preferences of our restaurant brands may present additional costs and challenges. For example, drive-through restaurants for 45 ----- restaurant brands operating in the QSR space, such as our Burger King brand, may require sites with specific characteristics and there are a limited number of suitable sites available in our geographic market. Desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation and we may face competition from other restaurant chains for the same or nearby locations. We may also relocate or open restaurants in new areas in anticipation of future development which ultimately does not materialize. In addition, if a franchisor under a Pure Franchise agreement terminates its relationship with us, ceasing restaurant operations in a desirable location, we may be required to find another replacement location, which may happen quickly or at all. Further, an increasing number of local authorities mandate certain environmental requirements in connection with the opening of new restaurants in their communities, including monitoring carbon impact and an assessment of impact on biodiversity. As a result, building permits for new restaurant sites may be more difficult to obtain or may require us to comply with new local requirements, which may be costly.

For more information about regulations applicable to our franchise contracts, notably the Loi Doubin and provisions of the French Commercial Code, see “Regulation.” Any claim that we have violated regulations applicable to our relationships with franchisees, including claims that we failed to provide sufficient information or support to a franchisee or claims that we impeded the ability of a franchisee to conduct its business freely, may, among other things result in the imposition of fines on us, harm our relationships with our franchisees, require us to compensate the affected franchisees or potentially trigger claims for contract annulment on the grounds of lack of consent, negatively impact the likelihood of potential franchisees joining our networks, and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, under French franchise law, franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who have freely entered into franchise contracts with a franchisor to use our brand names and know-how in exchange for payment of certain fees and royalties. Although we are not responsible for the employees hired by our franchisees, any change in the relevant laws or re-characterization of the employment relationships between our franchisees and/or their employees by a court or tribunal could oblige us to either hire such employees directly or make arrangements causing us to incur liabilities related to contributions to certain social security programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Our growth strategy is based on the sustained performance and expansion of our restaurant brand network, both through growth of the existing restaurants of the brands in our portfolio, as well as the introduction and integration of additional new restaurant brands within our network. As part of this growth strategy, we will continue to seek franchisees to operate new restaurants in France, both under existing and newly acquired or developed restaurant brands, and potentially abroad. We believe that our ability to recruit, train, retain and contract with qualified franchisees will be increasingly important to our operations as we expand. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to attract new franchisees, which will affect our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, while we apply stringent criteria when selecting new franchisees, such as previous experience in the business and access to financial resources, there is no assurance that the franchisee will be successful. 49 ----- Developing and opening restaurants involve substantial risks, including the following: - the availability of suitable locations and competition for such locations for potential development sites, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, and delays in obtaining construction permits, clearing potential pre-construction regulatory requirements and in completion of construction; - the impact of local tax, zoning, land use and environmental rules and regulations on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to develop restaurants, and the impact of any material difficulties or failures that we and our franchisees experience in obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals for new restaurants; - changes in governmental rules, regulations and interpretations; - the availability of financing, at acceptable rates and terms, to both franchisees and third-party landlords, for restaurant development; - employing and training qualified personnel; - securing acceptable suppliers; - developed properties not achieving desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened; and - general economic and business conditions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully open new restaurants or that such restaurants will generate strong sales or profits. Delays in the scheduled opening of new restaurants, due to construction hold-ups or other unforeseen issues, pose a significant risk to our expansion plans and financial forecasts. These interruptions can lead to increased costs, missed opportunities, and a delay in revenue generation, impacting our overall business momentum. Further, new restaurants may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful operating experience and, in such instances, we typically have to rely on the expertise and local knowledge of our local partners. Such markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets or to incur losses. Our growth strategy also contemplates network growth through the acquisition or development of new restaurant brands, including internationally. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately select the optimal location for such new restaurants based on target market, consumer preference and regional discretionary spending patterns as we begin to integrate new restaurants and brand concepts into our network, the performance of which will need to be monitored. Failure to properly deploy and utilize capital and other resources in furtherance of our identified strategy may negatively affect our planned activities. Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful execution of our business and growth strategy. Additionally, the implementation of our strategy may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment, which may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 50 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We have in the past acquired companies or businesses, such as our acquisition of the Pitaya restaurant network in 2022, the Léon restaurant network in 2019, the Hippopotamus restaurant network in 2017 and the QSR restaurant Quick’s network in 2015 (which we converted into Burger King restaurants), and may in the future strategically evaluate and pursue other acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including difficulties in integrating operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired restaurant network; difficulties in supporting and transitioning supply chains to our existing pre-approved supplier network; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or growth opportunities; failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings of an acquired restaurant brand, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices; risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees or vendors; or inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset acquisition costs, among others. In our evaluation of our recent and potential acquisitions, assumptions are made as to our ability to increase sales as well as improve restaurant-level profitability particularly in the areas of food, labor and cash controls as well as other operating expenses. If we are not able to make such improvements in these operational areas as planned, the acquired restaurants’ targeted profitability levels will be affected which could cause an adverse effect on our overall financial results and financial condition. Further, our growth plans include the organic creation and development of new brand concepts. This process involves significant development expenditures, which may not yield the results we anticipate achieving within a certain time, or at all. Any misjudgments in developing such brands (such as misjudging consumer preferences, target market, brand positioning or preferred consumption channels) or flaws in our execution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that the integration of new restaurant brands in our portfolio will generate the expected synergies and cost-saving benefits that contribute to our overall business strategy. There is a risk that these anticipated advantages may not materialize as expected or at all. The complexities of integrating a new restaurant brand into our existing network can lead to underestimating the costs and resources required. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the acquisition of restaurant brands and integration of acquired restaurants brand operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, the successful integration and growth of new restaurant concepts will depend on our ability to identify and enter into franchise agreements with high quality and motivated franchisees who are willing and able to execute our vision for such new concepts, which may evolve in early stages as the market performance of such restaurant brands is evaluated. If the integration process fails to deliver the projected synergies or if the costs of achieving these benefits are higher than anticipated, our financial performance and strategic positioning could be adversely affected. We may from time to time pursue disposals or cease operating certain brands, which involve numerous risks that could have an adverse impact on our business. Periodically, we may engage in the disposal of certain assets of our business or cease operating restaurant brand concepts that no longer help meet our objectives, which carries inherent risks. These disposals could lead to operational disruptions, loss of revenue and unanticipated costs or liabilities that may negatively affect our business continuity and financial health. The success of any disposal depends on market interest for the assets or business sold and our and our franchisees’ ability to maintain optimal management of operations during the transition phrase. Even following a successful disposal, we face the risk of potential claims by former franchisees or by purchasers of such assets or restaurant brands. Impairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or markets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations. This could result in a decrease in our reported asset value and reduction in our 51 ----- net income.

This execution of this strategy exposes us to numerous risks that could impede our success in new markets. Any future international operations could be negatively impacted by volatility and instability in international economic, political, security or health conditions in the countries in which we eventually operate, especially in emerging markets. Navigating different regulatory environments, cultural nuances and consumer preferences requires precise execution and adaptability. Missteps in understanding and adapting to these factors can lead to underperformance or failure of new international locations. Additionally, the complexities of establishing supply chains, recruiting local franchisee partners and talent to operate restaurants and managing operational logistics across borders add layers of challenge that could compromise our expansion efforts. If our international growth initiatives do not yield the anticipated results, this could adversely affect our overall business performance and strategic objectives. We may face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in franchisee selection and financing. We may eventually be subject to difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients (and ensuring food safety) in a cost-effective manner, hiring and retaining qualified team members, marketing effectively and adequately investing in information technology, especially in emerging markets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Additional General Business Risks,13.4.1,Our revenue and cash flows fluctuate seasonally and are affected by public holidays and weather conditions.,"Our revenue and cash flows are subject to seasonal fluctuations influenced by public holidays and varying weather conditions. These factors can influence footfall in our restaurant locations, which are typically higher during school holidays. Consumer consumption behavior and spending patterns are also influenced by weather conditions. Persistent rain, snow or other inclement weather, particularly during the summer months, over our peak trading periods or over weekends, adversely affects us. Certain of our restaurants, namely those with terraces or significant outdoor space, are particularly vulnerable to rain and other bad weather, as the inability to use their outdoor space prevents such restaurants from maximizing their trading capacity. Unfavorable weather conditions can also deter customers from physically dining out, opting instead for delivery service, which could come at a higher cost to us as we pay an additional fee to third-party delivery service aggregators, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. Seasonal fluctuations also impact our inventory, working capital and liquidity levels. We must carry a significant amount of inventory before the peak selling periods, which is also reflected in our liquidity with a certain time lag due to the payment terms that we have agreed with our suppliers. If net sales during our peak trading periods are significantly lower than we expect, we may be unable to adjust our working capital in a timely fashion. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Additional General Business Risks,13.4.2,"We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.","We currently lease the premises for all our Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants. Leases are generally for a fixed term between nine and twelve years and feature periodic increases based on indexation clauses. In addition, market practice for leasing commercial space in certain high value areas such as central Paris requires the payment of key money to lessors and/or the former tenant. Our ability to effectively renew our existing restaurant leases or obtain restaurant leases to open new restaurants depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We may not be able to renew our existing restaurant leases on favorable terms or 52 ----- at all, including, for example, when the landlord is able to establish statutory grounds for non-renewal or if the leases do not have the benefit of statutory or contractual rights of renewal. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with our landlords. This renegotiation may have an impact on our future leasing transactions moving forward as landlords who operate in the retail space may impose higher rents or new and stringent conditions that would prevent losses like those sustained as a result of pandemicrelated lease renegotiations. We typically occupy our restaurants under operating leases with terms of nine to twelve years. Any favorable rental rates that we are able to negotiate upon entering such leases in the years when there are high vacancy rates are not guaranteed to continue, and this may force us to pay higher rents once those leases expire or restaurants are closed in desirable locations. In addition, under French law, the maximum increases in rent imposed by law do not apply to leases with a term in excess of nine years. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including: - requiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing. We intend to prioritize Franchise with Lease Management structures with our franchisees moving forward for our Burger King brand, pursuant to which we will continue to own the leasehold rights of the restaurants that they operate, relying on lease management fees as a proportion of gross sales to pay our landlords for such leasehold rights. The proportion of gross sales that we collect from our franchisees varies depending on the restaurant brand. We cannot guarantee that our franchisees will not encounter financial difficulties that could prevent them from paying such lease management fees. Further, if an existing or future Franchise with Lease Management restaurant records reduced profitability, we would collect a reduced amount of fees as lease management fees are structured as a fixed proportion of their sales. Any failure by our franchisees to pay lease management fees or to pay a reduced amount of such fees as a result of reduced sales could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, if any of our Company Restaurants or Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants are not profitable and we decide to close them prior to expiration of the relevant lease, we would still be liable for the fulfillment of the obligations under the lease. In the event we decide to close any underperforming restaurant, we would have to renegotiate the terms of the lease agreement with the landlord for the remainder of the term of the lease and/or potentially assign or sub-lease the premises to a third-party.

As of December 31, 2023, we directly employed 5,973 full-time equivalent employees (excluding franchisees’ employees). Our human capital includes approximately 691 corporate employees that provide services to our franchisees, as well as approximately 5,282 employees for the management and operation of our Company Restaurants. Our franchisees are independent business owners that separately employ the management and personnel in the restaurants they operate, however they face similar risks related to labor and the need to maintain strong relationships with their employees. Consequently, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with our employees. The occurrence of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes could materially disrupt our operations or result in a 53 ----- loss of reputation or increased wages and benefits, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In France, many of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining framework in place for the hospitality sector that contain provisions that could affect our ability to make certain business changes that impact our employees. As is the case with most companies of our size, we have ongoing disputes with certain of our former employees and may face related litigation in the future, which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also seek to manage our labor costs and its impact on our margins. In this respect, we have to continuously monitor the productivity levels of our employees by measuring a variety of productivity indicators. In addition, we seek to minimize the long-term trend toward higher wages through increases in labor efficiencies; however, we may not be successful. Any increase in the minimum wage or labor regulations or protracted renegotiations of the restaurant industry collective contract in France could also increase our labor costs. As the minimum wage increases, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to the employees at wage rates which are above the minimum wage, which will increase our costs. The extent to which we are not able to raise our prices to compensate for increases in wage rates, including increases in social benefits costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, even if minimum wage rates do not increase, we may still be required to raise wage rates in order to compete for an adequate supply of labor. Furthermore, the successful operation of our Company Restaurants requires us to continue to attract, motivate and retain regional operational and restaurant general managers with the qualifications to succeed in our industry and the motivation to apply our core service philosophy. If we are unable to continue to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified managers or to motivate our employees to sustain high service levels, the perception of our brands could suffer and our business and our growth could be adversely affected. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions are in short supply. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced a number of additional difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees, in particular due to prospective employees’ perception of the restaurant industry as requiring long hours and difficult working conditions. The inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay the planned openings of new Company Restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing Company Restaurants, which could harm our business. While our franchisees are independent businesses, they face similar risks in locating and recruiting qualified employees, which could have an impact on the profitability of their restaurants, thus potentially reducing the revenues that we receive them.

In addition to decreasing our revenue and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could harm our reputation and the reputation of any of the restaurant brands in our portfolio, hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The rise of online news reporting, discussion forums and social media has increased the risk to brands of attracting negative publicity given the ease and speed with which such information is disseminated. We are particularly susceptible to such risks given the high degree of engagement with social media by certain of our key customer groups such as the student population. See “—Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social _media could adversely impact our business.”_ Further, we may be subject to employee, customer and other claims in the future based on, among other things, mismanagement, unfair or unequal treatment, discrimination, harassment, violations of privacy and consumer credit laws, wrongful termination, and wage, rest break and meal break issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. Certain of the restaurant brands in our portfolio have been subject to these types of claims in the past and if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

We own or use various intellectual property rights, including trademarks, logos, licenses and domain names. In addition, we are the master franchisee for certain brands in France (for example, in the case of Burger King and Itsu), which gives us the exclusive right to use and to grant the right to use the trademarks and trade names of such brands in France. Our success depends on our continued protection of our intellectual property rights and our ability to use existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness of the brands in our portfolio. In particular, some of the trademarks used in the operation of our restaurants are owned by third parties who have granted us 55 ----- the right to use such trademarks. Among other things, pursuant to these agreements we are required to invest certain specified amounts, comply with certain capitalization and store opening requirements, abide by the guidelines relating to the use of the relevant trademarks and trade names, comply with certain reporting obligations and keep the owners’ proprietary information confidential. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under such agreements and have good relationships with the owners, if we were to default on any of these agreements, or if any of these agreements were to expire and we were unable to renew them, we would lose the right to use the relevant trademark. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, in relation to the brands that we do not own, we do not have the ability to influence the decisions of the owners of our operating trademarks with respect to their use or disposition.

We run, directly or indirectly, an extensive array of information systems (including servers, networks, applications, websites and databases) that are essential to the operation of the restaurant brands in our portfolio and management of our activities including for our ordering systems, stocking activities, logistics, financial reporting and management of systems monitoring performance. Our operations therefore depend on the continued and uninterrupted functioning of our IT systems. The centralization of many aspects of our operations, such as purchasing, marketing, property, finance, human resources and IT, to a certain extent make such functions more vulnerable to a catastrophic failure at the site or sites at which the IT systems underlying such functions are physically located. The development, implementation and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network, applications, websites and other systems, including those which may be provided by third parties, are important factors across the operations of all of our restaurant brands. The robustness and efficiency of such systems and network infrastructure are critical to our business because our revenue and franchisee royalty calculations are based entirely on the accurate and timely recording of system-wide sales. We also collect and process personal data that we use in our daily business, including information about our employees, franchisees and customers through the use of loyalty programs for certain of our restaurant brands. Furthermore, we rely on technology not only to efficiently operate our restaurants but also to drive the customer experience, sales growth and margin improvement. Execution of our growth strategy will be dependent on our initiatives to implement proprietary and third-party technology solutions and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience. We may not be able recruit and retain qualified individuals for these efforts, and there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital 56 ----- relationships with customers. Our strategic technology initiatives may not be implemented in a timely manner or may not achieve the desired results. Even if we effectively implement and manage our technology initiatives, they may not result in sales growth or margin improvement. Additionally, implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on us. Moreover, our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. If our digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms, which could negatively impact our business. We attempt to effectively safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage or compromise from interruptions, data breaches, cyber-attacks, sabotage, hacking and phishing attempts. However, despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving such systems may occur in the future as well as regulatory intervention or reputational damage, and we could further incur liability to customers or experience loss of data. We cannot assure protection against unauthorized attempts to access the IT systems that we use. Further, there is a risk that inadequate disaster recovery plans and information security processes are in place to mitigate against a system outage, or failure to ensure appropriate back-up facilities (covering key business systems and the recovery of critical data) and loss of sensitive data, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

If we or any such third party service providers fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if any such loss of personal customer data were otherwise to occur or if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident or if our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and as a result information about our customers and employees is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately), we could be subject to liabilities and penalties, reputational damage, litigation or government enforcement actions, the incurrence of substantial costs and a loss of customer confidence, thereby adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”), governing the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data came. The GDPR obligates EU-based companies or companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing; and (iv) rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, right of access, right to rectification, or right to erasure. 57 ----- In spite of our continued efforts to comply with the GDPR and similar regulations, we still face the risk that customer data that we collect may be stolen or misappropriated. In particular, the GDPR offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought. Our customers may be discouraged from providing us with their data and our business could be negatively affected as a result. Under such circumstances, our regulation, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. As a data controller, we could face legal actions in the absence of compliance with GDPR. In addition, we could also face legal action in the absence of compliance of a third-party processing personal data on our behalf. Given that we and/or third parties, on our behalf, process certain sensitive information, we are subject to specific processing conditions and have taken steps to ensure compliance with these conditions. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. The GDPR provides for substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to 4.0% of the annual worldwide revenue of the preceding financial year or €20.0 million, particularly in the event of a breach of the conditions applicable to consent and/or related to data subjects’ rights. A fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease any processing). The GDPR, the national implementing legislation, i.e., the French data protection rules and French law in general, also provide for a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements and additional private enforcement mechanisms. For instance, the French supervisory authority may issue a public warning, as part of a control revealing infringements of the applicable data protection regulation, and in parallel a public formal order to comply with the applicable regulation. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is relatively complex. We, or the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in the future into supplier contracts, employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations. The failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant administrative fines and sanctions, as well as civil and criminal liability in some cases.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Additional General Business Risks,13.4.10,"Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business.","Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for our restaurant brands, our overall business or for the industry or market segments in which we operate (irrespective of whether such events are directly related to our restaurant brands or our operations). Such media topics could include food-borne or hygiene-related illnesses, issues with food traceability, contamination, unsanitary restaurant environment, issues relating to quality of service or product quality, discriminatory behavior, injuries or good citizenship. Media reports relating to any of these topics, even when not involving us, could reduce demand for our restaurants and could result in a decrease in customer footfall in our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. In particular, with respect to social media, consumers value readily available information concerning the industry and market segments in which we operate, and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to the accuracy of such information. The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Information concerning or affecting us may be posted on such platforms at any time, including accurate and adverse information that may harm our business. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our brands, our franchisees, our services or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers, could seriously damage our reputation and image of our brand restaurants, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. As part of our marketing and advertising strategy, we seek to develop the social media presence of the restaurant brands within our portfolio. Our social media presence amplifies consumer engagement with our brands, but comes with less control compared to more traditional marketing methods due to the possibility of negative consumer comments in real time that we cannot control. Further, the presence of such comments on the social media platforms of our restaurant brands could imply that our brands are associated with such content or views, which may not align with our values. The harm from the spread of such inaccurate information may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Any failure to maintain favorable brand recognition across the restaurant brands in our portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 58 ----- In addition, activist groups, including animal rights activists and groups acting on behalf of franchisees, the workers employed by suppliers and others, have in the past, and may in the future, use tactics to generate adverse publicity by alleging, for example, inhumane treatment of animals by our suppliers, poor working conditions or unfair purchasing policies. These groups may be able to coordinate their actions with other groups, threaten strikes or boycotts or enlist the support of well-known persons or organizations in order to increase the pressure on us or our industry to achieve their stated aims. In the future, these actions or the threat of these actions may force us to change our business practices or pricing policies, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A decrease in consumer patronage as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in our revenue at Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social media effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

See “Regulation”. These directives, laws and regulations relate to the remediation of land and water supply and use, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, noise pollution, the use of refrigerators and workplace and product health and safety. We are also subject to stringent food preparation, health, quality and nutritional disclosure regulations and standards, as well as permits and licenses for operating as a preparer of food products. Health, safety and environmental legislation in France and elsewhere has tended to become broader and stricter, and enforcement has tended to increase over time. The installation and operation of some of our restaurants and distribution centers require, depending on the required regulations, a number of environmental permits, including environmental impact assessments and environmental risk assessments. These authorities or those in charge of awarding environmental permits and licenses could revoke any of our permits, for reasons of public interest or if they determine that we have incurred in repeated violations of applicable laws and regulations, which could in turn affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, we may be liable for a number of environmental compliance costs in relation to our restaurant brands, such as costs relating to recycling (for example, recycling of our used cooking oil) and waste disposal. In addition, we may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances, including asbestos, on or in a property owned or leased by us. The costs of any required removal, investigation or remediation of such substances may be substantial thus, if we were found to be liable for the costs arising from any of these or other obligations or if our franchisees were unable to meet their rental payments as a result of such obligations (including fines for non-compliance), our revenue could be adversely affected. The presence of such substances or the failure to remediate such substances properly may also adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as security. Changes in law or regulation may impose further liabilities on us which may also form the basis of liability to third persons for personal injury or other damages. 59 ----- Any failure to comply with health, safety and environmental requirements may lead to fines and other sanctions and even restaurant closures, as well as damage our reputation and that of our restaurant brands. If health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in France or in the countries from where we source our ingredients significantly evolve or are strengthened in the future, the extent and timing of investments required to maintain compliance may differ from our internal planning and may limit the availability of funding for other investments. In addition, if the costs of compliance with health, safety and environmental directives, laws and regulations continue to increase and it is not possible for us to reflect these additional costs in the price of our products, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, compliance with current and future directives, laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming and could affect consumer eating habits. If consumer health regulations change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Further, in the ever-evolving regulatory landscape of the food service industry, there is a risk that government initiatives could mandate the inclusion of detailed nutritional information on menus. Should such regulations come into effect, we would be compelled to undertake a comprehensive analysis of our menu offerings across our restaurant brands to accurately report on nutritional content. This requirement would likely incur additional compliance costs, including but not limited to, the expenses associated with laboratory testing, menu redesign, staff training, alignment and training with our franchisees and the continuous updating of information to reflect any changes in menu items. The financial burden of adhering to these new regulations could be significant, potentially impacting our profit margins. Moreover, the implementation process could divert resources from other strategic areas of our business, such as marketing and customer experience enhancements. Therefore, we cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings accordingly. See “Regulation—Food and Beverage Regulations—Food Labeling and Nutrition.” We are also increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including the disposal of waste. These regulations are expected to become more expansive and stringent over time, which makes it challenging to predict the impact on our future operations. Additional changes in these laws and regulations could require us to devote capital or other resources to comply with such laws and regulations. As is the case for businesses of our size, we are subject to inquiries and investigations from regulatory bodies in the ordinary course of our business. Authorities may take the view that we are not compliant with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make significant expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

For instance, the French law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life (more widely known as the “Sapin II Law”) and other similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere. In the future, we may decide to enter countries that have legal and regulatory systems that are different than the one in France and in which corruption may occur more frequently and to a greater extent than in France. Under some circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but despite our compliance policies and training efforts (including hiring for an internal role exclusively dedicated to compliance with the Sapin II Law), we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or third parties. 60 ----- Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of import/export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, disbarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment.

Accordingly, French governmental actions concerning the economy could have a material effect on French private sector entities in general, and on us in particular, as well on the market conditions, prices and returns on our securities.

Further, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage caused by uninsured risks, and could remain liable for any debt or other financial obligation related to those properties. As a result of the nature of our business, we are also exposed to the risk of other health and safety incidents, for example, accidents occurring on our premises. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 61 ----- In connection with our insurance renewal process, our insurance costs may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages, in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general.

Although we have an internal audit department which maintains a comprehensive cash handling policy and aims to ensure there is minimal cash leakage out of the business, our internal controls in relation to cash management may not be sufficient to address all the risks associated with the handling of cash and cash transactions.

Such laws and regulations are generally very complex. Additionally, because tax laws may not provide clear-cut or definitive doctrines, the tax regime applied to our operations and intragroup transactions or reorganizations is sometimes based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws and regulations may make it difficult to restructure our operations in an advantageous manner. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate may result in reassessments, interest on late payments, fines and penalties. Furthermore, we may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss carry-forwards from our entities. The actual realization of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French tax code (Code général des impôts) (the “French Tax Code”), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of taxable profit exceeding €1.0 million.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (the “MLI”) signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, and ratified by France on September 26, 2018, which became effective as of January 1, 2019 may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. For all countries which ratify the MLI after France, the relevant dates of application should be calculated on an individual basis. The MLI notably introduces a “principal purpose test” (“PPT”) denying tax treaty benefits to companies when obtaining such benefits was “one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in” these benefits, unless granting these benefits under the given circumstances would be “in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions” of the tax treaty. Whether a France entity relying on tax treaty benefits can be construed as being part of such type of arrangement will predominantly depend on source state views. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”), as later amended on May 29, 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD **II”). The ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s tax adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules have been implemented into the French Code general des impôts (the “FTC”). See “French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of _the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on this rule._ In addition, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions, was also implemented into French law. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which 63 ----- is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. On May 18, 2021, the European Commission communicated a new framework for income taxation for businesses in Europe (“Business in Europe:",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) which aims to replace the pending proposals under the CCCTB.,13.5.1,,"BEFIT is based mainly on the framework of the OECD’s international tax reform project and would involve the consolidation of the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which would then be allocated to Member States using a formula and be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal is carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and is giving rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. On September 12, 2023, the European Commission adopted the BEFIT Directive proposal. Should this Directive be adopted, Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by January 1, 2028. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (the “ATAD",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management” according to which the expenses incurred by a French company, in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible. Under Article 39-1-3° of the FTC, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the FTC (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). (currently 5.39% for companies closing their fiscal year between November 30, 2023 and December 30, 2023) provided that the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in. By exception, under Article 212 I-(a) of the FTC, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible up to the 65 ----- amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the FTC or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the FTC, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are controlled by a same third-party enterprise under the conditions defined in (i) above. In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Articles 39-1-3° and 212 I-(a) of the FTC), non-deductible interest might be re-characterized as deemed dividends pursuant to Articles 109 _et seq. of the FTC, and may thus be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 _bis 2 of the FTC, at the rate of (i) generally 25% for payments benefiting to legal persons, or (ii) 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions (Etat ou _territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other_ than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in each case to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the FTC, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its tax adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. The net financial expenses are defined as the excess, if any, of the financial expenses of the borrower over its financial income. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount (i.e., the “Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor”). French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC increased by 1.5 time the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group, as determined under accounting consolidation rules, to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own debt-to-equity ratio (i.e., the “Indebtedness Safe Harbor”). These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer’s tax consolidated group (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer (or any company belonging to the same French tax consolidated group) from any related party not belonging to the tax consolidated group) (i.e., the “Thin Capitalized Perimeter”) and at the level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the Issuer’s French tax consolidated group with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. 66 ----- The 30% Limitation is increased by 75% of the portion of the net financial expenses which are non-deductible after application of the €3 million or 30% adjusted tax EBITDA limitation in three circumstances: (i) autonomous companies (i.e., companies which are not members of a consolidated group, have no establishment outside France and no associated company (appreciated between entities holding a stake of at least 25%)); (ii) companies or tax consolidated groups belonging to a consolidated group which do not qualify as a Thin-Capitalized Perimeter and that benefit from the Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor; and (iii) companies or tax consolidated groups belonging to a consolidated group which qualify as a Thin-Capitalized Perimeter but benefit from both the Indebtedness Safe Harbor and the Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by the relevant tax consolidated group and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed at the level of the tax consolidated group (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC which do not belong to such tax consolidated group. Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-ISBASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 _bis, I of the FTC under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 _bis, VII of the FTC under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the FTC and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC. In addition, the ATAD II, in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries has been implemented and is applicable as from January 1, 2020 (except for certain of its provisions which are applicable since January 1, 2022) and codified under Articles 205 B et seq. of the FTC provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Unlike the previous domestic anti-hybrid rules, payments made to taxexempt or low-taxed beneficiaries are not within the scope of these rules that only target differences in qualification or attribution of the right to tax an element of income. Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established and the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” (i.e., entities holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit) are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where such a hybrid entity is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax at its own level or taxable pursuant to Article 8 of the FTC at the level of its partners or shareholders, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. 67 ----- The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and may thus increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. On January 17, 2023, the European Parliament approved almost by unanimity the directive proposal to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for improper tax purposes within the European Union (the “ATAD III Proposal”), which was released by the European Commission on December 22, 2021. In order to be definitively adopted, the text will need to be approved by the Council of the European Union and subsequently implemented by Member States. Even if the European Council had initially targeted an application of this directive as from January 1, 2024, the exact timing for the vote and the directive’s implementation by Member States remains unclear at this stage. On September 12, 2023, the European Commission published a proposal for a Council Directive on transfer pricing (which is part of the BEFIT package) aiming at incorporating the arm’s length principle into European Union law, harmonizing the key transfer pricing rules, clarifying the role and status of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and creating the possibility to establish, within the European Union common binding rules on specific transfer pricing subjects. Should this directive be adopted, Member States would have to apply these provisions as from January 1, 2026. On October 8, 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the “Inclusive Framework”) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the 140 Inclusive Framework members. The TwoPillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar Two. Pillar One aims at ensuring a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located (“Pillar One”). Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the “GloBE Rules”) (“Pillar Two”). On 20 December 2021, the OECD published the pillar two model rules (the “Model Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October 2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE Rules into domestic legislation. They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii) determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the topup tax. 64 ----- On December 14, 2022, Directive 2022/2523 setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups was adopted. The directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 member states the Model Rules that include an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the European Union fundamental freedoms. In addition, the directive makes use of an option contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby the member state of a low-taxed income entity (referred as constituent entity) applying the IIR is required to ensure effective taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities residents in that member State. The Member States had to transpose the directive into their national laws by December 31, 2023 for the rules to be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023 (with the exception of the UTPR, which is to be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2024). The French Finance Law for 2024 (Law 2023-1322 of December 29, 2023) transposed the directive implementing Pillar Two into French domestic law, introducing a minimum tax of 15% on the profits of MNEs that operate in France and have a consolidated revenue of at least €750m generated during at least two of the last four fiscal years. On October 11, 2023, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework published the text of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Amount A of Pillar One (the “MLC”). Amount A of Pillar One co-ordinates a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions with respect to a share of the profits of the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises operating in their markets, regardless of their physical presence. It also ensures the repeal and prevents the proliferation of digital services taxes and relevant similar measures, secures mechanisms to avoid double taxation, and enhances stability and certainty in the international tax system. Furthermore, specific rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law. These regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Our tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties (including legal counsel), and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Under French law the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person and such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third 73 ----- parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. The Security Agent will hold all security interests to be pledged as Collateral. As regards the security interests to be pledged as Collateral governed by the laws of France, the Security Agent will hold such security interests to be pledged as Collateral as security agent for the beneficiaries under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. Furthermore, in order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-_ 25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of 1[st] July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the direction of the “instructing group”. Subject to certain exceptions described below and in further detail in the section entitled “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” among other things, the “majority_ _pari passu creditors”_ (generally, creditors representing the simple majority of, among other things, the outstanding principal amount under the Notes and any pari passu secured indebtedness) shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the 74 ----- right to instruct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Collateral, _provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. If, however: - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, in each case, within three months of the date on which an instructing group delivers a copy of their proposed enforcement instructions (the “initial notice”); or - the “super senior discharge date” (as described in the section below entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) has not occurred within six months of the date of the initial notice; or - an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a member of the Group; or - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making a determination, and the “majority super senior creditors” (as described below): (a) determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realization proceeds of any enforcement; and (b) deliver enforcement instructions they believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles before the Security Agent has received instructions from the majority pari passu creditors; then the Security Agent shall, instead follow the instructions that are subsequently given by the “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing more than 66.67% of the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain hedging liabilities), provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of respects. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the relevant hedging obligations or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the cash recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations or the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement actions against the Issuer or its subsidiaries, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which may be secured by security interests in the Collateral, the holders of the Notes may not constitute the requisite majority of pari passu creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent.

In France, the enforcement of the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured over such Collateral, as applicable, under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such a Guarantee or security interest in the Collateral is not in the grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such guarantee or security interest would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In France, the liabilities and obligations under the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce or infringement of the provisions of Articles L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French _Code de Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering of the Notes which the Issuer have applied for the direct benefit of each French Guarantor through intercompany loans. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the Guarantee and the security interest in the Collateral. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosure securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, 76 ----- the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. Consequently, in the event that the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the holders of the Notes are entitled to, and decide to, enforce the Collateral, as the case may be, which consists of a pledge over the shares of each Issuer, through judicial or private foreclosure, and the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the holders of the Notes may be required to pay immediately to the relevant pledgors a “soulte” equal to the amount by which the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. Alternatively, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. In addition, the Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral. Not all of the respective Issuer’ assets will secure, directly or indirectly, the Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the French economy and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of France. The security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Issuer cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Issuer also cannot assure you that the consents of any third 77 ----- parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of the Security”. Unless consented to by the holders of the Notes (and subject to certain exceptions), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the security interests in the Collateral unless, among other things, the relevant sale or disposal is made: - for consideration of which all or substantially all is in the form of cash; and - pursuant to a public auction, or if a fairness opinion has been obtained from an internationally recognized investment bank, accountancy firm or other valuation professional services firm selected by the Security Agent. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral may be released and retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes.

If a change of control were to occur, there can be no assurance that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or, in the case of the Issuer, that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Issuer’s other contractual obligations would allow the Issuer to make such required purchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that the Issuer have incurred or may incur in the future. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under any indebtedness that the Issuer have incurred or may incur in the future (including, in the case of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility), even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from their subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by the Group’s then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuer’s subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to fund the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, the Issuer expects that they would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. There can be no assurance that the Issuer would be able to obtain such financing. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon _a Change of Control”._ The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar refinancings involving the Issuer that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar refinancing. The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of each Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular refinancing would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of each of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. 79 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Under the BH Cash Management Agreement, the Issuer will advance to BH a_ portion of its cash on balance sheet to facilitate the deposit of such cash with certain financial institutions on its behalf in order to optimize its cash management and increase the return on its cash investments. BH can only invest this cash in liquid and risk-free financial instruments. The Issuer’s consolidated free cash will be subject to this arrangement. All funds the Issuer will advance to BH, and all securities purchased with such funds, and proceeds of all of the foregoing, are deposited in segregated accounts in the name of BH, and these accounts are pledged to the Issuer to secure BH’s obligations under the BH Cash Management Agreement. The Issuer’s receivables under the Cash Management Agreement will in turn be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Notes to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility. Under the BH Cash Management Agreement, the Issuer will have the right at any time to require BH to repay it any cash or other property held on its behalf by BH thereunder, subject to reasonable notice. However, the Issuer’s ability to enforce this right may be suspended in the context of certain French insolvency proceedings involving BH. Moreover, even though the Security Agent can, on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of Notes, enforce the pledge of the Issuer’s receivables under the BH Cash Management Agreement, thereby giving it a direct claim against BH on behalf of the holders of Notes, its ability to enforce this direct claim would be similarly adversely affected under such circumstances. Therefore, if BH were to become subject to insolvency proceedings, the Issuer’s ability to access the cash and other property held by BH on our behalf may be legally blocked, and the amount of such cash and other property may be significant. Moreover, the Issuer does not control BH, and, since BH is not in the restricted group under the Indenture or the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, it is not subject to the covenants set out therein.

Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. Such courts may also in certain circumstances void the security interest or a Guarantee where the company is close to or near insolvency. In France, among other limitations, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Notes may fall under the legal framework of hardening periods where certain arrangements or dispositions that are made during a specified period (the “hardening period”) preceding the opening order of reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings may be challenged by the receiver, the judicial administrator or the public prosecutor in bankruptcy and certain creditors under the applicable rules of avoidance. 81 ----- Indeed, while opening reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, a French Court will set the date on which the debtor is deemed to have become insolvent (date de cessation des paiements). This date can be fixed at any time up to 18 months prior to the judgement opening the proceedings (subject to certain exceptions). The period between the date of insolvency and the commencement of insolvency proceedings is known as the hardening period. The Indenture also permits the security interests in the Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. At each time, if the security interest were granted or recreated during the hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. For more information see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability _of the Guarantees and the Collateral”. In France, insolvency legislation tends to favor the continuation of a_ business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors. In the context of insolvency proceedings affecting creditors, including court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)), and court-controlled insolvency proceedings (safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard (sauvegarde accélérée) and reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement ou liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes could be limited or suspended. For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity _and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral”._ In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, or any other grantor of security interests in the Collateral, experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of more than one jurisdiction and there can be no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able to effectively enforce their rights in complex proceedings. The application of these laws may also conflict with each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your rights under the Guarantees and limit any amounts that you may realize from the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

The Floating Rate Notes will bear a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), plus an applicable margin, and the New Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable rate based on the EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Floating Rate Notes. Neither the Indenture nor the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements to fix a portion of these interest rates, there can be no assurance that any such current or future hedging arrangements will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of interest rate fluctuations or will not result in losses or that our risk management practices and procedures will operate successfully. If we determine that EURIBOR has been permanently discontinued or, at the request of the Issuer or the agent under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (acting on the instructions of the majority lenders), the agent will use an alternative reference rate in the manner as described in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such Floating Rate Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Although the Parent, the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on its or its subsidiaries’ directors and executive officers. In addition, as the assets of the Parent, the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of their respective directors and executive officers are generally located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with France. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France. In addition, the enforcement in France of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

The Issuer, which is fully owned by the Parent and which will, as of the Issue Date, own all of the assets and liabilities currently owned by the Parent, does not produce consolidated financial statements. We present in this Offering Memorandum certain consolidated financial information for the Parent and its subsidiaries, as well as certain consolidated financial information for Burger King France S.A.S. and its subsidiaries. The Parent is as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and will remain after the Issue Date, a holding company that conduct no business operations of its own and has no significant assets other than the equity interests and/or the intercompany receivables it hold in each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The material differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of the Parent on a standalone basis under IFRS and the rest of the Group represents mainly (i) a standalone net current liabilities (excluding cash) of €2.8 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalents of €1.1 million, (iii) a positive standalone EBITDA equal to €0.2 million and (iv) a net financial income of €0.6 million. The material differences between the consolidated financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 of the Parent on a standalone basis under IFRS and the rest of the Group represents mainly (i) a standalone net current liabilities (excluding cash) of €3.1 million, (ii) cash and cash equivalents of €0.0 million, (iii) a positive standalone EBITDA for the Parent equal to €1.4 million and (iv) a net financial expenses of €(21.8) million. As a consequence of the above, we believe that the financial information presented in the tables below, in each case subject to the differences noted above, adequately reflect what the Issuer’s consolidated financial results and financial position would have been for the applicable periods, in all material respects. The selected consolidated financial information presented in the tables below has been derived from the Financial Statements, free English translations of which is included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,907,UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE PARENT,907.1,Reorganization of Groupe Bertrand,907.1.1,,"Bertrand Franchise was created by Groupe Bertrand (founded and owned by Olivier Bertrand) in July 2023 to become the number one food service franchising platform in France with 7 brands (Burger King France, Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon, Pitaya, Volfoni and Itsu). During the second half of 2023, Groupe Bertrand sought to reinforce its growth strategy by improving the transparency and coherence of its various activities. To do so, Groupe Bertrand has reorganized its activities in order to distinguish two distinct and autonomous divisions: - Bertrand Hospitality, with exceptional places with unique know-how around 6 professions: Parisian restaurants & brasseries, tea rooms, luxury hotels, grocery stores & retail, events catering and an agritourism property located in Seine-et-Marne; - Bertrand Franchise, with strong brands that are developing as franchises around two positions: the fastfood industry with the master franchise Burger King for mainland France and La Réunion island and theme catering (Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon, Volfoni, Pitaya and the Itsu master franchise for France). 96 ----- To do so, Groupe Bertrand carried out the following legal reorganization: - On July 3, 2023, crossed contributions of assets took place between the parent company of Groupe Flo and the parent company of the Bertrand Restauration group (now Bertrand Hospitality). Following this reorganization, Groupe Flo owns a number of franchises, namely Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon and Volfoni. - On October 31, 2023, TopCo GB, of which Groupe Bertrand owned 60% and Bridgepoint the remaining 40% on that date, became head of the Group through acquisitions and contributions of 100% of the shares of Groupe Flo, United Lab, Miditsuco GB (the holding entity of the Itsu group), Holdco GB (the holding entity of the Pitaya group) and Bertrand Franchise Services (the holding entity of Bertrand Franchise Logistics), together with other controlled entities by Groupe Bertrand “Bertrand Casual Food”, which resulted in the issuance of 380,730 ordinary shares and 19,783 series A preferred shares. TopCo GB was renamed Bertrand Franchise (the “Parent”). - Prior to these contributions of shares, Groupe Flo had decided to divest the restaurants of its “Léon de Bruxelles” activity that did not fit into the makeover plan of the new “Léon fish brasserie” concept. In September 2023, the management of Bertrand Franchise confirmed its intention to divest this portion of its activities. Upon the acquisition of Groupe Flo, the Group recognized this activity as an activity acquired exclusively with a view to its subsequent disposal, in accordance with IFRS 5. - At the same time, as part of the development of the Parent, Groupe Bertrand, together with Bridgepoint, joined forces with landmark international partners. Groupe Bertrand and Bridgepoint welcomed two landmark international partners: AlpInvest and Goldman Sachs Asset Management (together referred to in this section as “United JVCO ltd”) to support the Parent’s next growth chapter. On October 31, 2023, United JVCO ltd subscribed preferred shares of the Parent for an amount of €458 million, which resulted in the issuance of 302,052 series B preferred shares. The cash inflows have been used to finance part of the group’s reorganization, as well as to repay in advance its convertible bonds subscribed by Bridgepoint. All of these entities and activities were and remain controlled by Groupe Bertrand, carried out by the head company of Groupe Bertrand’s Holding (“BH”). Alongside with the overall reorganization of the Group, on June 16, 2023, the Burger King France group purchased a majority share in the Burger King activity on the Island of Réunion (“BK la Réunion”), carried out by the companies S2FOI (which directly owns and operates 17 restaurants on the Island) and DISTRIFOOD.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

This operation would allow the Parent to facilitate the development of all its franchise activities but also to optimize the management of financial flows between the different Bertrand Franchise entities and brands. As described above, the reorganization was completed as of October 31, 2023. Consequently, the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2023, already reflects the full effect of the reorganization. Thus, the unaudited consolidated pro forma income statements have only been prepared for the following periods: - for the year ended December 31, 2023, see “-Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement Data for the _year ended March 31, 2024”;_ 97 ----- - for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, see “-Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement Data for the _three months ended March 31, 2023”;_ - for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, see “-Pro Forma Consolidated Income Statement Data for _the twelve months ended March 31, 2024”;_ (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements”, and together with the related notes and basis of preparation, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”). The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information presented herein illustrates the reorganization of the Bertrand Franchise perimeter, assuming that all of the related operations took place on January 1, 2023. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes and presents a situation by hypothetical nature. As a result, the hypothetical data included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information may differ from the actual results of the Parent. The Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements do not reflect any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings that may be achieved or any integration costs that may be incurred.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,907,UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE PARENT,907.5,"Entities”, each entity of the Acquired Entities being individually an “Acquired Entity”) for the period",907.5.1,IFRS contribution of Bertrand Casual Food and BK la Réunion,"The columns “IFRS contribution of Bertrand Casual Food” and “IFRS contribution of BK la Réunion” aim to reflect the contribution to the income statement for the period not included in the consolidated income statement of the Parent. 98 ----- The contribution of these entities is calculated as: - the IFRS contribution of the Acquired Entities for the entire period; - less the IFRS contribution of these Acquired Entities already included in the consolidated income statements of the Parent since the acquisition date (if any). None of the Acquired Entities have prepared consolidated financial statements that reflect all, or part of the scope of the reorganization. More specifically, because of the reorganization in July 2023 leading to crossed contributions of assets between Groupe Flo and Bertrand Restauration group, none of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, prepared by these sub-groups reflected the scope of the Acquired Entities. Consequently, statutory financial information for Acquired Entities was used as the basis of information (prepared under the generally accepted accounting principles in France (“French GAAP”)). Starting from this information, several adjustments to the statutory financial information have been compiled to form the IFRS contribution: _Mapping adjustments_ These adjustments have been performed to align all statutory financial information with the Parent consolidated income statement format. Statutory income statements are prepared using a classification by nature, whereas the Parent prepares a consolidated income statement using a classification by function. The mapping between these two formats has been performed using the nature of the account and the cost centers. _IFRS adjustments_ All statutory financial information being prepared in accordance with French GAAP, differences between French GAAP and IFRS have been adjusted, based on IFRS accounting rules and methods the Parent used for the preparation of its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Main IFRS adjustments are the followings: - leases: in accordance with IFRS 16, rental expenses recognized in statutory financial statements are restated, and a depreciation expenses on right-of use assets and interest expenses on lease liabilities are recognized. The interest expenses have been computed using the discount rate determined by the Parent at the acquisition date; - franchisee’s upfront fee: in French GAAP, the upfront fees paid for network access are fully recognized at the contract inception. In accordance with IFRS 15, network access is not distinct from the right to use the brand and know-how provided by the Group and therefore, upfront fees are spread over the duration of the franchise agreement; and - deferred tax: given that no deferred taxes are recognized in the statutory financial information, deferred taxes are hence recognized on temporary differences in accordance with IAS 12, using an effective tax rate of 25.82% for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. The deferred tax assets have been recognized only when the Group has determined that it is probable that future profit will be available, in accordance with the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of December 31, 2023. The tax consolidation scopes are aligned with the ones used in the consolidated financial statements, and no potential future tax consolidation reorganization has been reflected in this Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information. 99 ----- _Consolidation adjustments_ The entities having intercompany transactions over the entire period, consolidation adjustments were required. These aim to neutralize reciprocal operations between entities as well as any other internal operation (such as depreciation of securities or current accounts, internal profits, etc.), as if the actual scope (as described in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent) had existed on January 1, 2023. _Carve-out adjustments_ Among Groupe Bertrand and prior to the reorganization of Groupe Flo and the Bertrand Restauration group in July 2023, some entities included in these perimeters may have incurred costs and revenue that should be allocated to Bertrand Franchise business or to Bertrand Hospitality business. These entities are the following: Groupe Flo, Flo Gestion, Flo Formation, Concept restauration and OBH. An analysis has been performed in order to properly allocate the costs and revenue clearly applicable to the franchise business. Thus, the carve-out adjustments are the following: - the statutory financial statements of Groupe Flo for the period ended December 31, 2023 include the gain on disposal of the entities contributed to Bertrand Hospitality. As this gain is not related to the Parent business, it has been removed from the historical data; and - prior to the reorganization of Groupe Flo and the Bertrand Restauration group in July 2023, a Group Flo subsidiary, namely AGO, directly operated the “Brasserie des Champs” restaurant which has been transferred to the hospitality-related perimeter at the reorganization date. Therefore, all incomes and costs related to the “Brasserie des Champs” restaurant before the reorganization have been removed to reflect as if this carve-out had happened on January 1, 2023. The tax impact related to these carve-out adjustments has also been recognized. _IFRS 5 reclassification_ As described above and in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group recognized the restaurants of its “Léon de Bruxelles” activity that do not fit into the makeover plan of the new “Léon Fish brasserie” concept as an activity acquired exclusively with a view to its subsequent disposal, in accordance with IFRS 5. Therefore, the profit or loss related to these restaurants is presented separately from continuing activities on a dedicated line of the Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements. Based on that information, reclassifications have been posted to reflect the result for these activities held for sale for the entire 12-month period.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in the context of the business combination with the Acquired Entities have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the Parent as of October 31, 2023 at their fair value, being reminded that the allocation of the purchase price is considered provisional. 100 ----- All related depreciation and amortization are adjusted to reflect the incremental depreciation and amortization due to fair value adjustment as if the reorganization had happened on January 1, 2023. The additional depreciation and amortization expenses relate to franchisee agreements. The assumptions are aligned with those used for the consolidated financial statements. _Pro forma adjustments related to financing and related costs Adjustments related to the Bertrand Franchise convertible bond repayment_ As explained above, as part of the structuration of the Parent, United JVCO has subscribed preferred shares in an amount of €458 million that have been used to repay the convertible bond issued to Bridgepoint. The financial interests related to this convertible bond recognized in the historical consolidated financial statements have been restated as if the repayment had occurred on January 1, 2023. _Adjustments related to the financing of BK la Réunion acquisition_ In the context of the acquisition of BK La Réunion, financing through notes for an amount of €45 million subscribed in June 2023. The financial interests related to this debt have been calculated as if the notes had been issued on January 1, 2023. _Adjustments related to debt refinancing related to Groupe Flo and other subsidiaries_ In the context of the first reorganization step of Groupe Bertrand performed in July 2023, Groupe Bertrand has renegotiated the debts carried by Groupe Flo and the Bertrand Restauration group. As part of the first reorganization step performed in July 2023, the Groupe Flo state-guaranteed loans and EURO PP loans have been renegotiated under new terms and conditions. The adjustment consists in applying these new terms and conditions as if the renegotiation occurred as of January 1, 2023. Following the acquisition and the carve out of the entities formerly hold by Bertrand Restauration and OBH, some intragroup loans were transferred to Groupe Flo in July 2023. Similarly, in the context of the contribution of Groupe Flo shares to the Parent in October 2023, Groupe Bertrand also transferred the loans granted to Groupe Flo to the Parent. Prior to these transfers, the financial interests recognized in the income statement of the subsidiaries were recognized in the historical IFRS contribution as a transaction with a related party. The adjustment consists in assuming that these loans became intercompany transactions as of January 1, 2023, and in cancelling the related financial expenses. Lastly, in the context of the reorganization, Bertrand Corp granted a new loan to the Parent for an amount of €3.6 million in October 2023. The adjustment consists in assuming that this loan was implemented as of January 1, 2023, and in recognizing the related financial expenses. The financial interests have been adjusted as follows: - when the renegotiation implied a refinancing, the financial expenses related to the new financing agreement were recognized as if it was implemented as of January 1, 2023 and the financial expenses related to the previous financing agreements recognized in the historical financial statements were cancelled. When the new financing was based on a floating-rate, the interest expense was computed using the underlying floating-rate (but with the margin included in the financing agreement). 101 ----- - when the renegotiation resulted in a repayment without external refinancing (for instance, in case of intercompany loans with the Parent), the financial expenses related to the previous financing agreements recognized in the historical financial statements were cancelled. _Pro forma adjustments related to management fees with prior owners_ Before their acquisition by BK La Réunion, both Distrifood and SF2OI had contractual arrangements related to management fees with the prior owners. Since June 1, 2023, the management fees agreements with prior owners have been revised: a new management fees agreement has been concluded between BK la Réunion and the Parent, and the previous management fees agreement with the prior owners has been revised. The management fees expenses have been adjusted as if the renegotiation occurred as of January 1, 2023. _Adjustments related to tax impact_ The tax effects related to these adjustments are recognized in the Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statements using the effective tax rate. However, an analysis has been performed to identify whether the pro forma adjustment may affect the tax rate of the underlying entity. In particular, when the underlying entity is a loss-making entity for which no tax-loss carryforward has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements, the unrecognized tax-credit for the period is taken into account only if the tax adjustment requires an additional tax expense.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are France’s leading multi-brand food service franchising platform, renowned for our diverse and strategically curated portfolio of market-leading restaurant brands. Our portfolio encompasses a variety of eight wellpositioned distinct restaurant brands that cater to a wide range of attractive food service market segments, from QSR to casual dining formats, addressing all-day consumption occasions, as illustrated in the graphic below. We own six out of the eight restaurant brands in our portfolio (Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon, Volfoni, Pitaya and Jôyô), while we are the master franchisee in France for the remaining two brands (Burger King and Itsu). Our network spans over 1,000 restaurants across attractive locations throughout France, partnering with 423 franchisees, who together operated 83% of our restaurant network as of December 31, 2023. The remaining 17% of our restaurant network was comprised of directly-operated company restaurants (the “Company",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,"Restaurants”). For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated €1,016.8 million in Pro Forma Run-",17.2.1,,"Rate franchise sales and revenues and €318.8 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate Normalized EBITDA reflecting a 31.4% Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA margin. Our portfolio is diversified across cuisine styles and occasions and is operated mostly under a highly attractive franchise model through an efficient and synergistic platform. Our strength in identifying and responding to consumer preferences for cuisine, price point, format and channel through our various restaurant brand concepts has established us as a dominant player in the French food service industry. 110 ----- We have successfully scaled and grown our presence exponentially from 116 points of sale in 2010 to over 1,000 points of sale in 2023. In line with our continued growth, we have increased our SWS by a 12% CAGR over the 2019 to March 31, 2024 period. Our pace of growth is consistent, with between approximately 80 to 110 new restaurant openings every year over the 2019 to 2023 period and a strong pipeline of additional restaurant openings in the future. In recent years, our growth has been driven by the rapid expansion of our franchisee network through the opening of new franchise restaurants under both existing and newly developed or acquired brand concepts. We have namely experienced continued and steady growth with Burger King France (excluding Quick), the second largest QSR chain in France and for which we are the exclusive French master franchisee, representing approximately 51% of our restaurant network. As a result, we increased our total points of sale from 708 as of December 31, 2019 to 1,059 as of March 31, 2024, a large proportion of which was driven by growth in our franchised restaurants, increasing the total franchised portion of our restaurant network from 71% in 2019 to 83% on March 31. 2024. This growth had a strong corresponding impact on our _Pro Forma SWS, which increased from €1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2.8 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Our Pro Forma Adjusted Normalized EBITDA also increased from approximately €254 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, according to management estimates, to €307.4 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe our brand portfolio approach provides significant scale and synergies across brands, allowing us to capitalize on our market-leading capabilities, as illustrated by the successful roll-out of the Burger King brand in France to improve the performance of Bertrand Casual Foods’ current and future restaurant brands. Our operational model is well-established, historically successful and designed to be replicable across our existing and future restaurant brands. We facilitate a platform driven approach by leveraging our know-how and a synergistic approach to enhance brand operations and performance across all areas and stages of development. We have a historically proven ability to execute rapid roll-out and expansion through our in-house dedicated restaurant network development team, as well as to implement in-house processes for newcomer brands, which involves upgrading operations to meet our group-wide standards, transitioning into the franchised model, diversifying cuisine offerings and redefining brand concepts to resonate with current market preferences that we know well. These strategic initiatives were implemented to improve the financial performance and brand positioning of our existing brands allowing us to grow the proportion of franchised restaurants. This transition into our franchise operational model generates more profitability per restaurant, increasing the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) generated by each brand. For example, as part of Léon’s recent conversion into Léon Fish Brasserie, we redefined its concept and food offering to appeal to a younger and broader customer base, revamped its digital loyalty program to increase customer engagement, and accelerated restaurant openings under the franchise model. Together, these efforts contributed to an increase in ARS, evidenced by a 42% difference between the ARS of €1.2 million generated by Léon restaurants that are not yet converted and €1.7 million generated by the converted Léon Fish Brasserie restaurants, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2023. At the core of our success is our franchise model, which is strategically crafted to be both asset-light and cash generative. We have two principal types of franchise arrangements: Franchise with Lease Management, our franchise model through which we generate additional revenues from real estate lease fees from our franchisees, and Pure Franchise. By focusing the majority of our network on franchising rather than direct restaurant operations, we limit our exposure to the day-to-day fixed costs and investments typically associated with running 111 ----- food service establishments. Instead, these capital expenditure responsibilities are supported by our franchisees, who invest in the assets and infrastructure necessary to operate their locations. This approach allows us to concentrate on providing unparalleled franchisee support, brand stewardship and strategic growth initiatives. Our franchisees benefit from a proven business model that offers the potential for robust returns, while we capitalize on stable and predictable revenue streams through royalty fees, advertising fees and, in the case of Franchise with Lease Management, leasing fees. In turn, our franchisees are contractually required to adhere to the meticulously crafted brand standards for the restaurants they operate, the absence of which can result in termination of our contracts with them. Our model ensures a mutually beneficial partnership that drives collective success across our network of brands. We continue to strategically maintain and operate a limited number of selected directly-owned Company Restaurants, which represented 17% of our restaurant network as of the year ended December 31, 2023. This approach provides us with a platform to pilot new marketing, menu and omni-channel innovations before rolling them out across our franchise network. It also allows us to establish a benchmark of operational success through exemplary models for our franchisees to emulate, showcasing best practices in management, customer service and quality product. While operating a limited number of Company Restaurants will remain a key strategic part of our portfolio for these reasons, we expect the proportion of Company Restaurants in our restaurant network to decrease over time.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Such Bertrand Franchise Annual Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of a date of first application as of January 1, 2022. On October 31, 2023, Bertrand Franchise acquired a number of subsidiaries previously held directly by Bertrand Franchise Corp. through a series of transactions (such transactions, together, the “2023 Reorganization”), with the aim to bring all franchise activities under a single entity. Prior to the legal reorganization, Bertrand Franchise (formerly Topco GB) acted as the parent company of Burger King France, while the remainder of the restaurant brands currently within the Bertrand Franchise perimeter were owned by Bertrand Franchise Corp. Pursuant to the 2023 Reorganization, on October 31, 2023, Bertrand Franchise (formerly Topco GB) expanded its ownership to acquire shares in Groupe Flo, Miditsuco GB, Holdco GB, Bertrand Franchise Services, United Lab and other entities controlled by Bertrand Franchise Corp. (together, the “Acquired Subsidiaries”), which held and operated the additional restaurant brands in our current portfolio. Bertrand Franchise thus became a platform for multisegment franchised restaurant brands. As a result of the 2023 Reorganization, the different entities acquired by Bertrand Franchise have been fully consolidated in the Parent Annual Financial Statements from October 31, 2023, reflecting a 2-month IFRS income statement contribution.

Our franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who remunerate us by paying one-off entry fees upon the opening or conversion of their restaurants and through the payment of a certain percentage of their SWS as brand royalties. In the case of Burger King brand restaurants, we pay part of these brand royalties in turn to BK Europe. Moreover, for Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, we also receive lease payments as a percentage of sales. As a result of our franchise arrangements, our results of operations and our profitability are significantly affected in a positive way when our franchisees are performing well. During the periods under review, our franchisor network grew in line with the further development and growth of the restaurant brands within our network.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.5.2,"Consumer preferences and societal trends, general economic conditions and consumer sentiment","Our results of operations during the periods under review have been, and in the future may continue to be, affected by changes in consumer preferences and societal trends. Among the most significant trends that have affected our results of operations is the increased prevalence of eating away from home as the habits of the French population begin to exhibit greater convergence with other Northern European countries. As a result, the restaurant industry has grown in line with this increase in out-of-home dining. Demographic, social and economic trends underlying this decline include profound shifts in the way people live, work and eat in recent decades that have accelerated with economic and technological changes. More people are living alone, which means that people are eating out alone, stopping to eat while in transit or getting together to eat outside the home as a social activity. In addition, more French households with children have dual incomes, meaning both parents are working and more likely to be on the go during the week and pressed for time on the weekends. Moreover, more French young people are working while pursuing their studies and therefore have comparatively more spending power than prior generations. These demographic, social and economic changes support the segment in which we operate, including the QSR and casual dining segments, as the price points are accessible, customer service delivery is geared towards efficiency and the portion sizes can be generous. Our results of operations are also influenced by changes in consumer preferences and trends regarding taste, packaging, ordering and customer service. To the extent we are able to maintain a fresh brand image, healthy and environmentally-conscious menu options and good reputation among consumers for products that appeal to them, our results of operations will be positively affected. Conversely, if we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to such changes by evolving our product offering, menu customization options, portion sizing, pricing and other aspects of our business operations adequately and in a timely fashion, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We are constantly seeking to stay at the vanguard of consumer preferences through product offering and customer service, and have begun initiatives to better satisfy customer needs, for example through the improvements to our omni-channel offerings for our restaurant brands, including mobile apps, which facilitate the ordering of Click & Collect options, as well as customer loyalty programs. In addition, our results of operations are also affected to a degree by global economic conditions and specific local economic conditions in the markets and geographic areas in which we operate. Such conditions include levels of employment, disposable income, consumer confidence and consumer willingness to spend, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including gross domestic product and interest and inflation rates. During the periods under review, our results of operations were affected by the state of the French economy. According to INSEE, French GDP grew by 6.4% in 2021 (reflecting a rebound from the significant decrease in GDP in 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), 2.5% in 2022 and 0.9% in 2023. During periods of economic growth, consumers tend to eat outside the home more frequently, young people (an important demographic, particularly for the QSR sector), tend to have more disposable income and consumers generally tend to travel more often for work or leisure, all of which can lead to greater traffic in our restaurants and contribute to System-wide sales (“SWS”) generation. Conversely, during periods with unfavorable economic conditions characterized by stagnant or negative GDP growth and/or a decrease in disposable income, consumers may reduce the frequency with which 114 ----- they dine out or choose more inexpensive restaurants when dining away from home. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, therefore, can reduce customer traffic, as consumers may prefer to prepare food at home, or comparison shop for the best promotional deals from restaurants, which can reduce our total sales. Nevertheless, we believe that our positioning in the QSR segment with good value-for-money products mitigates the impact of potential changes in general and local economic conditions as this sector has historically been relatively resilient. In addition, customer traffic is a product of, among other things, consumer sentiment which can be affected by significant global or national events. Large-scale sporting or cultural events can encourage additional travel to certain regions by domestic and international tourists, which can drive traffic at certain restaurant locations where the event is held or on routes to such locations. Conversely, events such as terrorist attacks or civil disturbances such as prolonged labor strikes can negatively affect our results of operations and discourage customers from dining out, particularly if transportation networks are disrupted.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.5.3,Evolution of our network,"One of the drivers of our results of operations is the size and evolution of our restaurant network. We have historically expanded our restaurant network through the conversion of restaurants operating under the existing Burger QSR brand, Quick, which we acquired in December 2015 and through the opening of new restaurants (both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants) under the Burger King brand. Our historical strategy of converting acquired Quick restaurants into Burger King brand restaurants permitted us to accelerate our development of the Burger King brand in France, allowing us to convert a total of 226 restaurants into Burger King brand restaurants as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we no longer operate any Quick brand restaurants, while 2 remaining Quick brand restaurants are under conversion to Burger King brand restaurants (as compared to December 31, 2021, when we operated eight remaining Quick brand restaurants). Prior to the 2023 Reorganization, we organized our business in accordance with two segments: the Burger King brand and Quick brand. For further information, see the BK France Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes thereto, an English translation of which is included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. During the period under review, we continued to expand our restaurant network through the targeted expansion of our Burger King brand restaurants, including by the acquisition of 17 new Burger King brand restaurants located in La Réunion on June 16, 2023, upon the completion of the acquisition of 70% of the shares of Burger King La Réunion. In addition, during the period under review, the 2023 Reorganization was completed, whereby the Parent acquired a number of subsidiaries previously held by Bertrand Franchise Corp. These subsidiaries currently represent the Bertrand Casual Food reporting segment. Following the integration of additional restaurants into our perimeter as a result of the 2023 Reorganization, as of December 31, 2023, our perimeter included six additional restaurant brands, comprising 519 additional restaurants (including 98 Company Restaurants and 421 Franchise Restaurants). For further information, see “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial Information _Presented—First set of IFRS-compliant financial statements.”_ As a result of the aforementioned changes, our network of restaurants expanded from 441 as of December 31, 2021 to 1,055 as of December 31, 2023.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.5.4,Mix of Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants in our network,"Our results and our margins are affected by the evolution of the mix between Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants in our network. Directly operating Company Restaurants adds additional costs to our structure, such as personnel costs and lease costs that we cannot ultimately recuperate, as compared to our Franchise Restaurants (notably with our Franchise with Lease Management restaurants, which allow us to charge our franchisees a lease management fee), generally resulting in a lower margin of SWS when compared to Franchise Restaurants. In addition, we generally incur capital expenditures and pre-opening costs with each new Company Restaurant, whereas due to franchise arrangements, the cash flow impact on the Group for adding a new Franchise Restaurant 115 ----- is more limited and the sales and margin impact may be significant. Additionally, the cost of converting a Franchise Restaurant is also more limited in terms of investment than opening a Company Restaurant, though the return in terms of additional royalties is significant. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024 we opened 44, 44, 54 and 18 restaurants, respectively, of which one, three, seven and one were Company Restaurants. Over the same periods, we also converted a limited number of Quick brand restaurants into Burger King brand restaurants in 2021 and 2023. In 2021 we converted 20 Quick brand restaurants (of which only one was a Company Restaurant, while the other 19 restaurants were Franchise Restaurants), while in 2024 we only converted one Quick brand restaurant into a Burger King Franchise Restaurant. We generally record pre-opening or preconversion costs corresponding to costs incurred prior to the opening or conversion of a new restaurant, including, where applicable, staff costs, recruitment costs and training costs. During years with a high number of Company Restaurant openings, such costs may be unevenly distributed and disproportionally recorded during certain quarters before the sales uplift is experienced. This necessary network growth may affect certain cost items in our consolidated income statement as well as our cash flow related to investing activities in our consolidated cash flow statement. We expect this opening effect to continue to be recorded, though the mix of Company Restaurants opened will likely diminish over time as network expansion stabilizes. In addition, QSR and casual dining restaurant locations generally require a certain level of renovation and refurbishment roughly every seven to nine years, in order to maintain customer traffic. The following discusses the main trends discernable when examining the evolution of our network during the periods under review that affected our results of operations. The “novelty effect”, which we use to describe the strong sales performance experienced by newly-opened restaurants, which record high average restaurant sales (“ARS”) in their first few months of operations that are significantly higher than the ARS of other restaurants within our network. For example, this has historically been the case of our newly-opened or converted Burger King restaurants. We believe the novelty effect results from the strong brand equity that Burger King enjoys in the French market as a relatively newly-arrived challenger in a market long dominated by McDonald’s. Also contributing to this effect is Burger King’s strong value proposition characterized by good quality ingredients and great taste at accessible prices, which resonates with customers. As a result, Burger King restaurants register minimal ramp up time as the first month’s ARS has historically typically exceeded that of the entire Group perimeter. Factors that can affect the intensity and duration of the novelty effect include, among other things: - the number of restaurants in the catchment area (generally the novelty effect is more pronounced for the first restaurant); - the distance to competitor’s restaurants; - the demographics of the catchment area; and - the characteristics of the restaurant (i.e., city center, suburban area, shopping mall or drive-through location). The pace of the growth of our network has depended, and in the future will likely depend, on a combination of factors, including, among other things, the prioritization of certain clusters to achieve better network density in our restaurant network and decreased logistics costs, receipt of necessary permits and landlord consents, securing financing in the case of franchisees (as applicable) and discussions with franchisees. As a result, the restaurants opened or converted during the periods under review represent a mix of locations, categories and sizes, thereby producing non-uniform effects on our results of operations depending on the circumstances. 116 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.5.5,Cost base,"Our cost base is comprised of a mixture of variable, semi-variable and fixed costs. Variable costs primarily include food and logistics costs and selling costs. Operating and occupancy costs (comprising (i) costs incurred for the ordinary course operations of a restaurant, such as, for example, utilities, standard maintenance and repairs or security and (ii) rental costs and property taxes), as well as general & administrative expenses are mainly fixed costs, while personnel costs have both a fixed and semi-variable component. Personnel costs related to staff in Company Restaurants are semi-variable whereas personnel costs in connection with headquarters and Company Restaurants’ management are generally fixed. In the event of a decrease in SWS, we may not be able to reduce our cost base in a timely manner, in particular as it relates to our fixed costs, which could adversely impact our margins. However, in the event of an increase in SWS, we benefit from a strong operational leverage as SWS growth allows favorable scale effects. The following sections discuss the main factors affecting the principal items of our cost base. _Food and logistics costs_ Franchise Restaurants within our network are responsible for their own food and logistics costs as our franchise model is based on the outsourcing of food purchases and logistics services. Our franchisees work with a certain limited number of pre-approved suppliers that we have pre-approved for each brand, which allows us to retain a certain degree of consistent quality control across our brands as approval of suppliers is subject to our internal due diligence process. Our franchisees then are able to order raw materials and supplies independently and directly from our approved suppliers or logistics platform. In certain cases, they are able to order products directly from wholesalers or other suppliers. Our Burger King brand currently operates under its own separate pre-existing supply chain and procurement platform. Pursuant to our franchise agreements, Burger King operations are required to source raw materials from BKC-approved suppliers. As a result, all Burger King restaurants independently purchase supplies for their needs from approved suppliers. These purchases include food products and the paper and packaging materials for the sale of our products, as well as cleaning supplies and other products for the maintenance of equipment. We also have a certain number of separate pre-approved suppliers from which the rest of the brands in our network make purchases. In preceding years, we have developed a significant French network of approved suppliers, which has helped to control our logistics costs as a percentage of revenues as we no longer need to heavily rely on imports of raw materials and semi-finished goods from approved suppliers in neighboring European countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria. We have also worked to capitalize on synergies for our existing brands to narrow down the pool of pre-existing suppliers (lowered from 19 to 9) and to standardize purchase prices across our brands (with the exception of Burger King which, as described above, operates under its own separate pre-existing supply chain and procurement platform). We have further managed our supply costs by implementing a purchasing strategy for raw materials which allows us to obtain price commitments from suppliers by giving them mid- to long-term visibility on volumes and growth in France. Moreover, we have entered into forward buying contracts with our suppliers, except for beef, which limit our exposure to any short term fluctuations in food prices. A typical forward buying contract provides for fixed prices for at least six months. In addition, we entered into mid- to long-term contracts with our strategic suppliers for beef, French fries, buns, chicken and beverages. This strategy allows us to have pricing visibility and minimize the impact of fluctuations in food and supply prices on our operations for the duration of these contracts. However, despite the above strategies to manage our supply costs, many of the principal ingredients that our restaurant brands use in preparing food are commodities and are subject to price volatility, notably beef. For our Burger King brand, we purchase all of our beef from suppliers that are strictly required to purchase beef only from the European Union, with a limited number of countries of origin (France, Germany and Austria). For our Burger King brand restaurants, nearly 50% of our beef came from France in 2023. As of March 31, 2024, 59% of our beef came from France. European beef prices are driven by the interplay of supply and demand dynamics. 117 ----- In addition, we seek to optimize spending on our logistics activity, which we manage through third parties. For the Burger King brand, procurement and logistics activities are outsourced and handled by QSL-STEF, a joint venture of QSL and STEF dedicated to the QSR sector. QSL-STEF purchases our food supplies and other raw materials from various suppliers. We contractually set certain targets and goals with QSL-STEF, which monitors our inventories and packaging in addition to ensuring that goods and materials reach our restaurants from their point of origin at an optimal cost and service level. Franchisees order their raw materials and supplies directly from QSL-STEF as an approved vendor. As we rely on QSL-STEF for coordinating logistics for all of our restaurants, we are able to negotiate favorable terms as a block and provide our Franchise Restaurants with the ability to achieve preferential price points, improving their overall results of operations. For the other restaurant brands in our portfolio, our logistics of key products are managed predominantly through third parties Transgourmet and Sysco. Where we can, we aim to centralize our product supply and logistics platform to streamline operational efficiency and manage costs. We expect food and logistics costs to decrease as the network grows and becomes more dense, as already historically demonstrated by the reduction in total number of suppliers for our brands and ability to lower and standardize costs through our network, further supporting our and our franchisees’ ability to meet customer demand with efficiency and reliability. Enhanced buying power owing to the growth of our network has helped, and potentially in the future can help, us to attain high standards of product quality and more competitive pricing. These factors can have positive effects on our customer proposition and the profit margins of our Company Restaurants, though we expect that they will not affect our franchise revenues since our royalties and lease payments are calculated as a percentage of their sales. An ancillary benefit of our cost reduction initiatives is that franchisees may have greater financial means to invest more quickly in a second or third restaurant. The effectiveness of our supply and logistics chain can also impact our costs of sales and administration expenses. See “Business—Operational Synergies of our Multi-Brand Franchise Model—Supply Chain and Procurement _Platform” for more information. Leasehold and occupancy costs_ We currently rent almost all of our Company Restaurants and our Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants through commercial or ground leases (as compared to restaurants operated as Pure Franchise where we do not incur any rent or rental costs). We are the tenant of record for both types of restaurants, though pursuant to our Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, the franchisee pays us a percentage of sales for rent, generally with a fixed minimum. Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, discussed in more detail under “Business—Our Operating Models—Franchise Restaurants” require us to be liable for the rent payment. However, not only do they provide us with control over the real estate, but the percentage of sales paid by the franchisee compensates us for our ownership and management of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and covers the underlying leasehold costs. Franchise with Lease Management restaurants represented approximately 47% of our Franchise Restaurants as of December 31, 2023. Our Franchise Restaurants operating under Franchise with Lease Management arrangements pay us for the use of the real estate through a lease management fee based on a percentage of SWS, typically subject to a minimum yearly rent that coincides with our fixed costs under the relevant lease. As a result, when such restaurants perform well, our leasehold costs improve as a percentage of our revenues, which grow from higher fees as a percentage of franchisee SWS. Our leases generally contain an annual increase pursuant to an indexation clause that is based on, among other things, inflation. The agreed index must have some connection with the activity carried out by one of the parties or to the purpose of the lease. The majority of our leases are based on the Commercial Rent Index (ILC) (indice _des loyers commerciaux) published by l’Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (INSEE), the_ French public statistics institute. See “Business—Real Estate”. Increases in our leasehold and occupancy costs occur when we open new Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management restaurants. Opening new restaurants also has the effect of increasing restaurant overhead more broadly with additional rent, fixtures, insurance and other costs. Certain restaurant locations, particularly in transportation locations and at large shopping malls, may have a variable rent set at a percentage of sales, typically with a certain minimum rent. To manage leasehold and occupancy costs, we focus on site selection, the right-sizing of the restaurant, and the negotiation of leases that are realistic in terms of the sales that such location can generate. In this process, we are 118 ----- informed by the data from our other restaurants and we are guided by conservative guidelines for rent as a percentage of sales. We rely on the extensive experience of our in-house development team, which has developed a standardized network development and roll-out process for site sourcing, development and construction. Over the course of the periods presented, we managed 483 restaurant openings between 2019 to 2023 across several restaurant brands. See “Business—Restaurant Development”. We recognize our leasehold and occupancy costs pursuant to the accounting rules under IFRS 16, which primarily affect the accounting for our operating leases. IFRS 16 (Leases), which the IASB published on January 13, 2016 and which have applied from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases, and requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Under this standard, an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease payments, are recognized. Under IFRS 16, we as lessee recognize assets corresponding to the right to use the underlying leased asset for the estimated term of the lease, as well as liabilities corresponding to the discounted obligation to make lease payments for substantially all leases. _Labor costs_ In addition to the cost of our headquarters staff and management, we hire employees directly for our Company Restaurants, while franchisees are responsible for their own labor costs. Labor costs primarily comprise the salaries of team members employed in individual restaurants plus managers and restaurant directors. The QSR and casual dining categories are labor-intensive, which is compounded by the fact that pursuant to French law and applicable collective bargaining agreements, our ability to make use of part-time work and require overtime is limited to certain prescribed thresholds. Though labor costs are largely fixed, restaurants directors and managers receive a variable component of their compensation based on ARS and other performance indicators such as profitability and respect of brand standards (e.g., quality and service). During the periods under review, as our restaurant network expanded, we regularly made new hires for new Company Restaurants and for our general & administrative structure to gear for growth, and our results of operations reflect the integration of such employees into our cost structure, although labor costs as a percentage of total Company Revenue slightly decreased in December 31, 2023 as a result of lower levels of labor costs in the new Company Restaurants that we acquired in La Réunion. Additionally, a portion of pre-opening costs generally includes employee wages as staff must complete training prior to the opening of the relevant Company Restaurant. The QSR and casual dining segments generally have a high turnover among team members, which can increase training costs and reduce productivity, but gives us some flexibility to adapt the staffing level to the level of sales through attrition when sales decrease. We seek to manage labor costs based on right sizing the staff for each Company Restaurant according to restaurant size and the expected footfall informed by similarly situated restaurants. For our Burger King brand restaurants, we also focus a portion of our new restaurant development efforts on originating drive-through locations which tend to be more efficient from a labor-cost point of view because of the higher traffic that easily absorbs the additional staff cost. For new restaurant openings, applicable collective bargaining agreements for the fast food sector allow us to use short-term contracts and part-time work, which helps us to accommodate the higher footfall trends during the novelty effect period and also ensure the correct staffing level for the particular restaurant. We also manage team members on short-term contracts by attrition, given the high turnover in the QSR segment. We focus on internal promotion of restaurant managers from the ranks of team members.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.5.6,Product attractiveness and brand recognition,"Our sales and margins can be impacted by the relative success of new products launched. The success of new menu items launched in our restaurant brands is attributable to a variety of factors, including the attractiveness and taste of the product, suitability of the product to changing consumer preferences, perceived product quality, alignment of new menu initiatives with brand image and customer expectations and competition from other comparable products launched by our competitors. Launch of a successful new product or an in-demand limited time offer can result in a sales uplift by encouraging additional orders from our customers. Conversely, a lack of new product offerings, an unsuccessful product or an incomplete roll-out of a new product can decrease sales if customers are not satisfied. Examples of new products during the period under review are the launch of our veggie range for the Burger King brand. 119 ----- Brand recognition is another factor that can affect results of operations for the restaurants operating under our various brands. Positive associations regarding product quality, service and value for money, among other factors, can help consumers make a decision regarding which restaurant to patronize. We centralize our brand management to a dedicated internal team that seeks to reinforce brand differentiation by clearly defining brand concepts to allow for consistent messaging and quality across each of our brands, enhancing brand recognition and awareness. When we integrate a new restaurant brand in our portfolio, we focus on improving its brand concept by aligning its menu, products and pricing architecture to our assessment of its target market.

We invest annually in innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns. Our advertising expenses are partly financed by our franchisees, who are required under the terms of their franchise agreements to contribute a percentage of sales (between 1.0% to 3.5% of SWS annually depending on the brand and franchise arrangement) as advertising fees, which we then use to market, advertise and promote initiatives and programs for the brands they are part of. Restaurants’ SWS and results of operations can be significantly affected by the frequency and effectiveness of our advertising and promotional programs. During the periods under review, we prioritized the development and consistent presence of social media, targeted digital marketing and efficiency loyalty programs. We have focused on creating videos for sharing on social media outlets such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook, which we believe are the most effective ways to reach our customers as well as engage in influencer marketing.

This increase was mainly driven by the increase in sales under the Burger King brand, as well as the 2023 Reorganization. Consumer sales increased by €59.9 million, or 97.9%, to €121.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €61.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase was largely driven by the opening of nine new Burger King restaurants, the acquisition of Burger King La Réunion with 17 restaurants, the contribution of a 112 new restaurants operated by Bertrand Casual Food (of which 104 following the contribution of Groupe Flo dated October 31, 2023, and eight from restaurant openings). This increase was partially offset by four permanent closures of restaurants operated by Bertrand Casual Food and the transfer of operations to franchise partners of three restaurants belonging to the Burger King Group scope, and two restaurants belonging to the Bertrand Casual Food scope, all five previously operated directly by the Group. Entry fees and other sales decreased by €4.4 million, or 22.1%, to €15.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €19.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

This increase is partially offset by lower costs for real estate development contracts, in connection with the slowdown in this activity in the three months ended March 31, 2024 (9.2 million euros in the first quarter of 2024 compared with 17.1 million euros in the first quarter of 2023 for the Burger King brand). _Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Operating and occupancy costs increased by €8.4 million, or 62.7%, to €21.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €13.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to the increase in the number of restaurants within our perimeter following (i) the BK La Réunion acquisition which occurred in 2023 and (ii) the 2023 Reorganization. _Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_ Depreciation and amortization (restaurants) increased by €11.5 million, or 57.5%, to €31.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €20.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to the increase in the number of restaurants within our perimeter following (i) the BK La Réunion acquisition which occurred in 2023 and (ii) the 2023 Reorganization. _Selling costs_ Selling costs increased by €5.6 million, or 42.1%, to €18.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €13.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to the increase in the number of restaurants within our perimeter following (i) the BK La Réunion acquisition which occurred in 2023 and (ii) the 2023 Reorganization. _Brand royalties_ Brand royalties increased by €2.4 million, or 12.2%, to €22.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €19.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to the increase in Burger King’s SWS. 131 ----- _Pre-opening costs_ Pre-opening costs remained stable at €0.5 million over the two periods. _Other operating income/(expense)_ Other operating income increased by €1.4 million to €1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to a €1.3 million increase in disposal gains on assets, to €1.3 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2024, from nearly zero for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. _General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €13.8 million, or 109.5%, to €26.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €12.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to (i) the BK La Réunion acquisition which occurred in 2023 and (ii) the 2023 Reorganization, (iii) understaffing during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 and (iv) the increase in activity triggered by the development of new projects, which led to higher external service costs. _Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_ Depreciation and amortization (corporate center) increased by €0.3 million, or 21.4%, to €1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to (i) the BK La Réunion acquisition which occurred in 2023 and (ii) the 2023 Reorganization. _Other corporate income and expenses_ Other corporate expenses increased by €1.8 million to €1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from nil for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Other corporate expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2024 mainly relate to capital gains on disposals linked to restaurant network management operations. _Other non-recurring income and expenses_ Other non-recurring expenses increased by €1.5 million to €1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly attributable to restaurant closing costs. _Net financial income/(expense)_ Net financial expense increased by €4.0 million, or 13.3%, to €34.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €30.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase is mainly due to: - the additional €45 million of Existing Senior Secured Notes, generating an increase in interest on bond debt in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This additional amount has not been hedged by interest rate instruments. However, the Group benefited from higher investment income than in the previous year, offsetting the rise in interest expense in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023; - the repayment of interest on the Parent’s convertible bonds, which took place on October 31, 2023 as part of the 2023 Reorganization; 132 ----- - interests on the bond and financial debt of the Groupe Flo and Pitaya business combinations from October 31, 2023; - the increase in interest on IFRS 16 debt explained by the business combinations of Groupe Flo and Pitaya; - the increase in IFRS 16 debt linked to the signing of new contracts and the opening of new restaurants over the period; and - and the increase in interest rates over the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. _Income tax_ Income tax decreased by €1.3 million, or 43.3%, to €1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease in the effective corporate income tax rate between the two periods following the change in perimeter following the 2023 Reorganization. _Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_ Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method remained stable at nearly zero over the two periods. _Net profit/(loss) for the period_ As a result of the foregoing factors, net loss for the period decreased by €4.1 million, or 83.7%, to €0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Of this total increase, SWS for the Bertrand Casual Food segment increased by €143.6 million due to the 2023 Reorganization, pursuant to which we acquired the brands within this segment. SWS for the Burger King Group increased by €328.2 million, or 20.8%, to €1,909.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €1,581.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in network sales for the Burger King Group was predominantly driven by the opening of 44 new Burger King brand restaurants (38 of which were Franchise Restaurants), enhanced by the acquisition of 17 new Burger King brand restaurants located on La Réunion island, targeted price increases as a result of a high inflationary environment and the development of new offers and successful marketing campaigns. In addition, the increase in SWS over the periods was also partly due to the French government phasing out the requirement for the COVID-19 related sanitary pass, which was compulsory to dine-in restaurants until March 2022. 133 ----- _Results of operations_ The following table sets forth the consolidated results of operations of the Group for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.

In addition, the increase was driven by other changes to our network, including the opening of 44 new Burger King brand restaurants, five Au Bureau brand restaurants, one Hippopotamus brand restaurant, one Léon Seafood and Cocktail brand restaurant, one Volfoni brand restaurant and two Pitaya brand restaurants (38, five, one, zero, one and two of which were Franchise Restaurants, respectively) and the acquisition of 17 new Burger King brand restaurants located on La Réunion island. This increase was partially offset by 17 permanent closures of restaurants, of which one operated under the Burger King brand as a Franchise Restaurant, six operated under the Quick brand (of which four operated as Franchise Restaurants), one operated under the Au Bureau brand as a Franchise Restaurant, one operated under the Hippopotamus brand as a Franchise Restaurant, and eight operated under the Pitaya brand (of which three operated as Franchise Restaurants). Franchise royalties increased by €64.4 million, or 21.4%, to €365.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €301.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was largely driven by higher sales from restaurants operated under the Burger King brand, as a result of targeted price increases throughout 2023, both with respect to home delivery and in-store channels, as well as the development of new offers and successful marketing campaigns; and to a lesser extent, by franchise royalties from the brands acquired through the 2023 Reorganization. This increase was partially offset by changes to our network, as a result of which certain restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants were transferred to Company Restaurants. Consumer sales increased by €95.6 million, or 41.4%, to €326.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €230.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was largely driven by the aforementioned drivers which increased sales of restaurants operated under the Burger King brand, as well as the aforementioned Burger King restaurant openings throughout the year and, to a lesser extent, to the increase of brands within our perimeter driven by the 2023 Reorganization. Sales of goods and equipment to franchisees amounted to €4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and are the direct consequence of the 2023 Reorganization. With respect to our Pitaya brand restaurants, we act as central purchaser and provider of most raw materials and goods required to manufacture finished products sold to customers, which drove the amounts of sales of goods and equipment to franchisees over the period. This central purchasing activity does not exist for the Burger King brand restaurants, which are responsible for their own purchasing directly from suppliers (see “Business—Operational Synergies of our Multi-Brand Franchise Model— _Supply Chain & Procurement Platform”)._ Further, while our entry fees and other sales increased over the period to €73.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of an increase in revenues invoiced to various stakeholders in relation to our property development activity. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by €65.6 million, or 34.7%, to €254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €189.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase in cost of sales was also largely driven by an increase in the cost of supplies and merchandise related to increased activity by our Burger King and other brands Company Restaurants, as well as to the high inflationary environment in the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was slightly offset by the price increases that we implemented in 2023 in order to manage inflation. In addition, over the period, we experienced higher costs in connection with our property development contracts. While we experienced an increase in staff costs overall, labor costs, as a percentage of our total Company Restaurant revenue, slightly decreased as a result of low levels of labor costs in our restaurants located in La Réunion. _Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Operating and occupancy costs increased by €24.3 million, or 59.3%, to €65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in operating and occupancy costs was largely driven by the increase in the number of restaurants within our perimeter, as well as a rise in energy costs as a result of a high inflationary environment over the course of 2023, despite our efforts to mitigate this increase through energy consumption reduction. _Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_ Depreciation and amortization (restaurants) increased by €16.9 million, or 21.7%, to €94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Selling costs_ Selling costs increased by €11.6 million, or 22.3%, to an expense of €63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from an expense of €52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is primarily attributable to the growth of our perimeter and to the increase in Burger King’s SWS by €328.2 million, or 20.8%. _Brand royalties_ Brand royalties increased by €16.5 million, or 23.3%, to €87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase of SWS for the Burger King brand between the two periods. _Pre-opening costs_ Pre-opening costs increased by €0.8 million, or 100.0%, to €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is mainly attributable to six new restaurants opened as Company Restaurants (as compared to three in the year ended December 31, 2022). 136 ----- _Other operating income/(expense)_ Other operating income decreased by €1.3 million, or 32.5%, to an income of €2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from an income of €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly attributable to the decrease by €0.7 million of disposal gains on the sale of asset between the two periods; and to the increase by €0.7 million to €1.2 million in the depreciation of trade receivables. _General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €16.3 million, or 37.3%, to €60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is mainly due to increased staff in the year ended December 31, 2023 following the under-staffing observed during the year ended December 31, 2022, and to the increase in activity triggered by the development of new projects, which led to higher external service costs. As a percentage of revenues for the Burger King brand, general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) remained fairly stable over the two periods of comparison. _Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_ Depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly increased by €0.4 million, or 6.7%, to €6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from €6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Other corporate income and expenses_ Other corporate expenses increased by €4.1 million to an expense of €3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from an income of €0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is principally due to an increase in provisions for supplier liabilities. _Other non-recurring income and expenses_ Other non-recurring expenses decreased by €0.6 million to an expense of €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from an expense of €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was mainly attributable to a reversal of impairment losses in the amount of €1.3 million, relating to the definitive closure of the remaining Quick restaurants, partially offset by transaction costs in June 2023 linked to the acquisition of 70% of shares in Burger King La Réunion. _Net financial income/(expense)_ Restated net financial expense increased by €11.6 million to an expense of €121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from an expense of €110.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Income tax_ Income tax increased by €18.7 million to an expense of €20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from an expense of €1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is principally due to the full activation of fiscal losses carried forward for a total amount of €10.2 million. 137 ----- _Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_ Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method remained stable at nearly zero over the two periods. _Net profit/(loss) for the period_ As a result of the foregoing factors, net loss for the period decreased by €13.2 million to a net loss of €10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from net profit of €3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

This increase in network sales was driven by several factors. This period witnessed the positive effects of loosening governmental restrictive measures implemented over the first half of 2021 to combat the impacts of COVID-19, including loosening lockdown measures and the compulsory implementation of a health pass for entry to restaurants between mid-2021 through early 2022. In addition, over the course of 2022, while our costs increased resulting from a high inflationary environment, we were able to pass on some of these costs to our customers through both our delivery and in-store channels. We also opened 44 new restaurants and developed new offers, both of which had a positive impact on our total SWS. This increase in SWS was partially offset by an overall high inflationary environment, due in part to the ongoing war in Ukraine, as we were not able to pass on some, but not all, resulting increased costs from inflation to customers. The increase in SWS was also offset by the definitive closing and disposal of 3 restaurants in the year ended December 31, 2022. _Results of operations_ The following table sets forth the consolidated results of operations of Burger King France for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

This increase was mainly due to (i) the positive effects of loosening governmental restrictive measures implemented over the first half of 2021 to combat the impacts of COVID-19, including loosening lockdown measures and the compulsory implementation of a health pass for entry to restaurants between mid-2021 through early 2022, (ii) price increases from passing on increased costs in the context of a high inflationary environment to our customers through both our delivery and in-store channels and (iii) the development new offers, combined with successful marketing campaigns. In addition, over the course of 2022, we opened three additional Burger King Company Restaurants Franchise revenues increased by €79.6 million, or 35.9%, to €301.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from €221.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was largely attributable to the aforementioned drivers that impacted the growth of our Company Restaurant revenues and overall system-wide sales. In addition, over the course of 2022, we increased the number of overall restaurants operated as Franchise Restaurants by 47 restaurants, totaling 418 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2022 (of which 413 were operated under the Burger King brand and five operated under the Quick brand), as compared to 372 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2021. The total net change in restaurants over 2022 reflected 46 new Franchise Restaurants, of which 41 restaurants were new Burger King Franchise Restaurant openings and six Franchise Restaurants were formerly operated as Company Restaurants that were transferred to the franchise model. One Franchise Restaurant was definitively closed over the period. These positive growth drivers were 139 ----- slightly offset by the adverse international inflationary context in 2022, which we believe had an impact on consumer impact and spending overall. Other revenues decreased by €16.1 million, or 20.6%, to €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in our property development activity as a result of projects that were aborted or postponed over the period; a decrease in conversion fees invoiced to franchisees upon the conversion of a Quick restaurant into a Burger King restaurant (no restaurants were converted in 2022, as compared to 20 restaurants converted during 2021); and the impact of implementing IFRS 15 for the first time in 2022 in connection with our loyalty program. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by €18.6 million, or 10.9%, to €189.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

This increase was driven by (i) the increase in Company Restaurant food costs by €11.1 million, or 19.9%, to €67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and (ii) the increase in Company Restaurant labor costs by €12.0 million, or 20.8%, to €69.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in Other costs by €4.4 million, or 7.7%, to €52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The overall increase in cost of sales over the period was largely attributable to higher raw material and personnel costs in line with increased inflation in 2022, as well as a reduction in social charges granted by the French government and booked in 2021 as part of COVID-19 related governmental relief measures, which explains our comparative higher labor charges in 2022. As a percentage of Company Restaurants revenues, food costs increased by 1.7 percentage point to 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is mainly attributable to high levels of inflation in 2022, partially offset by price increases that we were able to implement to pass on costs to customers. As a percentage of Company Restaurant revenues, labor costs increased by 2.0 percentage points to 30.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase over the periods is mostly due to the exemptions from social charges that we were granted in 2021. Other costs decreased by €4.4 million, or 7.7%, to €52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from €56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in our property development activity as a result of development projects that were aborted or postponed. 140 ----- _Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ The following table shows our operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

This increase was attributable to increases in utility costs, repair and maintenance costs and rental costs, which were partially offset by a slight decrease in other operating and occupancy costs. Utility costs increased over the period by €0.8 million, or 16.0%, to €5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase reflects higher activity across our network in 2022 compared to 2021, coupled with a high inflationary environment, which further increased our utility costs. Repair and maintenance costs increased over the period by €1.7 million, or 19.8%, to €10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by higher activity across our network in 2022 compared to 2021. Rental costs increased over the period by €2.2 million, or 200.0%, to €3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by the net increase in the overall number of restaurants over the period, as well as the accounting of rebates granted by landlords in 2021 following COVID19 related negotiations. The foregoing cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operating and occupancy costs, which decreased over the period by €0.6 million, or 2.7%, to €21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was driven by fewer home delivery fees invoiced by food delivery aggregators in 2022 as compared to 2021, as a portion of our dine-in areas were closed in the first half of 2021 in relation to the COVID-19 government restrictive measures, resulting in a higher volume of home delivery purchases. _Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_ Depreciation and amortization (restaurants) increased by €3.7 million, or 5.0%, to €78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €74.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, following the increase of the size our network. _Selling costs_ Selling costs increased by €12.3 million, or 31.0%, to an expense of €52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from an expense of €39.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in Burger King’s SWS by €365.4 million over the period. Selling costs as a 141 ----- percentage of SWS remained fairly stable, representing 3.3% for both the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. _BK brand royalties_ BK brand royalties increased by €16.4 million, or 30.1%, to €70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to the growth in our SWS over the period, including as a result of the additional SWS generated by the 44 new Burger King restaurants opened in 2022. _Pre-opening costs_ Pre-opening costs remained stable at €0.8 million between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. _Other operating income/(expense)_ Other operating income decreased by €1.1 million, or 21.6%, to an income of €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from an income of €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is mainly due to reversal of provisions related to trade receivables in the fourth quarter of 2021, following an observed decrease in risk. _General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €4.4 million, or 11.1%, to €43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was mainly due to an increase in activity as compared to 2021, when our activity was limited during the first half of 2021 as a result of COVID-19 related restrictive measures. _Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_ Depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly decreased by €0.2 million, or 3.2%, to €6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from €6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Other corporate income and expenses_ Other corporate income decreased by €0.4 million, to an income of €0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from an income of €1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Other non-recurring income and expenses_ Other non-recurring expenses increased by €0.3 million to an expense of €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from an expense of €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is mainly attributable to disposals of assets in 2022 linked to the definitive closure of two Company Restaurants in 2022. 142 ----- _Net financial income/(expense)_ Net financial expense decreased by €12.5 million, or 15.5%, to an expense of €67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from an expense of €80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is mainly attributable to a high level of financial charges in 2021, following the early repayment of the fixed tranche of then-outstanding bond debt, which induced (i) the payment of early repayment fees and (ii) the payment of the remaining refinancing fees of our former outstanding notes issued in 2017, which were fully paid on November 2, 2021. _Income tax_ Income tax decreased by €10.1 million to an expense of €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from an expense of €12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease is principally due to the high level of income tax in 2021 as a result of the conclusion of our internal legal organization in the fourth quarter of 2021, including certain disposals related to our discontinued perimeter. _Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_ Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method decreased by €0.1 million to an expense nearly equal to zero for the year ended December 31, 2022, from an income of €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Income from assets held for sale and discontinued operations_ Income from assets held for sales and discontinued operations decreased by €13.5 million to zero for the year ended December 31, 2022, from an income of €13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This variation resulted from disposals of our discontinued Quick perimeter as of October 8, 2021. _Net profit/(loss) for the period_ As a result of the foregoing factors, net profit for the period increased by €37.6 million to net profit of €44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from a net profit of €7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Despite representing only 10% of the outlets, foodservice chains in France have been gaining momentum in recent years, increasing their market share by nearly 10%, from 34% in 2019 to 43% in 2023. This increase illustrates the higher revenue per restaurant generated by foodservice chains compared to independent operators. _Source: Euromonitor_ 150 ----- The acceleration of foodservice chain penetration during the COVID-19 pandemic was driven by lockdowns and related restrictions, which reduced on-premise consumption and boosted take-away and home delivery services. Brands benefited from a number of advantages which supported their resilience, including: (i) good value for money, which appeals to consumers, (ii) quicker adaptation to the omni-channel shift, (iii) consistent quality across networks, which generates stronger customer trust, (iv) economies of scale for roll-outs of innovative solutions and offers, and (v) financial strength to support operators in a challenging market environment. Food service chains are also more prevalent in the QSR segment, which outperformed other market segments during the COVID-19 pandemic. A consistent pattern has been observed across international markets, with foodservice chains outperforming independent operators as a result of the range of advantages they present to consumers. These include affordability, quality and consistency for customers, as well as industrialization, cost efficiency and accelerated rollout for operators. From that standpoint, the French foodservice market appears to still be underpenetrated by brands compared to more mature markets such as the UK. _Source: Euromonitor_",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,The French consumer foodservice market,18.1.2,Development of the franchise model in France and in the foodservice market,"According to the Fédération Française de la Franchise, the contribution from franchise businesses to the French economy is one of the largest in Europe. In 2023, revenues generated by franchise businesses reached approximately €88.5 billion, increasing by more than 15% year-on-year, well above the 0.9% GDP growth. This expansion of franchised revenues in the country was supported by a 3% growth in the number of franchised networks and 9% growth in the number of franchise outlets since 2022. The demand for franchise business and outlets has been very resilient historically and has grown at an average CAGR of approximately 5% since 1995, boosted by individuals’ appeal for entrepreneurship: _Source: Fédération Française de la Franchise_ The penetration of the foodservice market by franchise networks remains comparatively lower than the one observed in other industries, which provides operators with significant room to develop their networks. For instance, franchise revenue accounts for 37% of the grocery retail sector, but only 13% of the foodservice sector, indicating a potential growth opportunity of 24%. This model is attractive to both franchisors and franchisees. For franchisors, it offers a fast and asset-light rollout with a margin-accretive development model. For franchisees, it provides turnkey concepts, well-known brands that generate footfall traffic from day one, strong operational support, including location, loans, procurement, training, staff, and robust economics with a short pay-back period. 151 ----- _Source: Fédération Française de la Franchise_",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,The French consumer foodservice market,18.1.3,Growth in the French consumer foodservice market,"The resilience of the consumer foodservice market in France and its historical growth have been underpinned by secular drivers, stimulating both demand and supply dynamics. These underlying trends have contributed to structural evolutions in consumers’ habits over time. We believe the following factors support the market in which we operate: _Decreasing time to cook driving need for convenience_ The increasing proportion of working parents, along with a greater average distance between home and workplace have gradually reduced the time available for the preparation and consumption of meals. Out-of-home consumption has emerged as a preferred option for consumers looking to optimize their working schedules and maximize their leisure time. _Increased out-of-home consumption as a result of the growing position of chain restaurants versus independent operators_ The increased density of chain restaurants has been one of the key factors behind the growth of the French consumer foodservice market. Foodservice chain restaurants facilitate consumers’ access to away-from-home dining by increasing the number of available locations and making the opening of new restaurants easier compared to the process for independent operators. Chain restaurants have the ability to leverage economies of scale and benefit from a logistical advantage to provide consumers with a varied menu of competitively priced meals with consistent quality throughout the network. The ability of chain restaurants to offer significant pricing discounts, combined with the significant financial resources they devote to marketing campaigns, contribute to their success. In addition, when traveling, consumers may prefer chain restaurants over independent operators due to the consistent level and standard of service throughout their extensive national network. _Growing share of non-traditional daypart consumption_ The foodservice market has historically generated the largest part of its revenues around lunchtime, and to a lesser extent during dinner. In recent years, the diversification of food offering and the expansion of menus into non-traditional dayparts, such as breakfast, coffee and snacks, have increased the propensity of individuals to consume out-of-home meals throughout the day, providing a substantial growth opportunity for market players to capture incremental demand. 152 ----- _Higher penetration of digital channels_ Digital channels and tools have steadily gained traction among consumers with evolving lifestyles and increasing acceptance of digital solutions. Digital revenues have become an important driver of growth providing both increased consumer convenience and an enhanced customer journey for on-premise consumption. This expansion of digital solutions also enables operators to leverage their network and achieve operating efficiency through the use of digital kiosks, tablets and mobile payments. Furthermore, the use of mobile applications and presence on third-party food delivery applications enables restaurant operators to build a direct relationship with customers, increase brand awareness through social media, and enhance customer lifetime value through loyalty programs. With 80% of consumers in France reported to be choosing which restaurant to visit based on information they find online, a strong digital presence has become a key success factor for industry players. _Off-premise consumption gaining momentum resulting in increasing importance of omni-channel distribution_ Restrictions regarding on-premise consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digitalization of the foodservice sector, as consumers were either unable or unwilling to dine-in. Although the sector has now almost fully recovered from the effects of the pandemic, many customers continue to use take-away, drive-through or home delivery services, which became a common habit for consumers in France. According to Euromonitor, in 2023, these services accounted for nearly two-thirds of revenues in the QSR sector, and an even higher proportion in terms of number of transactions in the burger, pizza, and Asian QSR sub-segments. The development of off-premise consumption has been further driven by the increase in frequency of eating and consumers’ demand for more convenience. _Demand for healthy, quality eating and diverse cuisines_ In recent years, consumers have become increasingly health-conscious and mindful of the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet. This heightened awareness is partly due to ongoing health and wellness campaigns across Europe, promoting the benefits of organic food, vegetarian and vegan options with an emphasis on local, seasonal and natural ingredients. Consumers have become increasingly knowledgeable about specific diet-related health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and obesity, which has led to an increase in the demand for healthier food products including fish, vegetables and poultry. The globalization of consumers’ tastes and growing multiculturalism have fueled demand for variety and choice, driving individuals’ desire for diversified culinary experiences. Players in the foodservice industry have been able to quickly adapt to these new trends, with major restaurant chains now focusing on improving the nutritional quality of their offerings and communicating nutritional information on the packaging of their products. Market players are also committed to develop and expand their menus to incorporate more diverse and healthier alternatives (for example, plant-based meat alternatives, salad and fresh fruit), which appeals to a wider consumer base. _Ability to increase average ticket price_ Out-of-home spending has remained positively oriented in recent years in spite of the inflationary context which has constrained consumers’ purchasing power. According to Euromonitor, the French consumer foodservice market value has increased by 9% in 2023 supported by a moderate 4% growth in average ticket prices across market segments, including a 3% for full-service restaurants and a 5% for QSR. Despite the increase in selling prices, footfall traffic has remained robust, improving by 5% year-on-year which demonstrates the structural resilience of the sector in periods of economic downturns. 153 ----- The average ticket price for restaurants in the QSR segment increased at a faster rate than other categories primarily benefitting from the perception of affordability and a base effect compared to full-service restaurant, which are characterized by a higher average ticket price.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Out-of-home consumption in France is well-established but remains behind other European countries notably Spain, Italy or the UK, a disparity which presents significant opportunities for further expansion. _Source: Euromonitor_ The French foodservice market displayed strong stability and resilience historically. In 2020, COVID-19 related lockdowns and other restrictions led to an unprecedented decrease in market value, which decreased to approximately €30.8 billion. Since 2020, the French consumer foodservice market has now almost fully recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, recording an increase of approximately 17% in value and 12% CAGR in terms of footfall traffic primarily due to positive supply and demand dynamics. Industry players have managed to rapidly adapt to the new landscape by accelerating the rollout of their omni-channel distribution platforms, a development which was largely facilitated by consumers’ increasing acceptance of digital tools. Off-premise consumption remains very popular with a large portion of customers opting for take-away, drive-through or home delivery services. 149 ----- _Source: Euromonitor_ The French consumer foodservice market can be split into five main segments: quick service restaurants (“QSR”), full-service restaurants, cafés and bars, self-service cafeterias and street stalls and kiosks. In 2023, quick service restaurants and full-service restaurants were the largest addressable segments, representing approximately 52% and 21% of total transactions and 41% and 46% of market value, respectively. The market value contribution of the QSR segment increased from approximately 30% in 2019 to 41% in 2023. This growth was driven by operators adapting their distribution model during the COVID-19 pandemic, a shift in demand towards digital channels and off-premise consumption, the success of their business concepts, and the relatively low average ticket prices of this category. The relative importance of full-service restaurants’ contribution to the overall market value, compared to their contribution in volume, is primarily due to their higher average ticket prices. _Source: Euromonitor_",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The recovery of the QSR segment has been robust, with its market value rebounding as early as 2021 and volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. _Source: Euromonitor_ The relative resilience of the QSR segment during the pandemic primarily resulted from the ability of operators to transition their distribution model towards online revenues, drive-through, take-away and delivery services, effectively offsetting the decrease in on-premise consumption.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.5,BUSINESS Overview,18.5.1,,"We are France’s leading multi-brand food service franchising platform, renowned for our diverse and strategically curated portfolio of market-leading restaurant brands. Our portfolio encompasses a variety of eight wellpositioned distinct restaurant brands that cater to a wide range of attractive food service market segments, from QSR to casual dining formats, addressing all-day consumption occasions, as illustrated in the graphic below. We own six out of the eight restaurant brands in our portfolio (Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon, Volfoni, Pitaya and Jôyô), while we are the master franchisee in France for the remaining two brands (Burger King and Itsu). Our network spans over 1,000 restaurants across attractive locations throughout France, partnering with 423 franchisees, who together operated 83% of our restaurant network as of December 31, 2023. The remaining 17% of our restaurant network was comprised of directly-operated company restaurants (the “Company",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,"Restaurants”). For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated €1,016.8 million in Pro Forma Run-",18.6.1,,"Rate franchise sales and revenues and €318.8 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate Normalized EBITDA reflecting a 31.4% Pro Forma Adjusted Run-Rate EBITDA margin. Our portfolio is diversified across cuisine styles and occasions and is operated mostly under a highly attractive franchise model through an efficient and synergistic platform. Our strength in identifying and responding to consumer preferences for cuisine, price point, format and channel through our various restaurant brand concepts has established us as a dominant player in the French food service industry. We have successfully scaled and grown our presence exponentially from 116 points of sale in 2010 to over 1,000 points of sale in 2023. In line with our continued growth, we have increased our SWS by a 12% CAGR over the 2019 to March 31, 2024 period. Our pace of growth is consistent, with between approximately 80 to 110 new restaurant openings every year over the 2019 to 2023 period and a strong pipeline of additional restaurant openings in the future. In recent years, our growth has been driven by the rapid expansion of our franchisee network through the opening of new franchise restaurants under both existing and newly developed or acquired brand concepts. We have namely experienced continued and steady growth with Burger King France (excluding Quick), the second largest QSR chain in France and for which we are the exclusive French master franchisee, representing approximately 51% of our restaurant network. As a result, we increased our total points of sale from 708 as of December 31, 2019 to 1,059 as of March 31, 2024, a large proportion of which was driven by growth in our franchised restaurants, increasing the total franchised portion of our restaurant network from 71% in 2019 to 83% on March 31. 2024. This growth had a strong corresponding impact on our _Pro Forma SWS, which increased from €1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2.8 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Our Pro Forma Adjusted Normalized EBITDA also increased from approximately €254 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, according to management estimates, to €307.4 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe our brand portfolio approach provides significant scale and synergies across brands, allowing us to capitalize on our market-leading capabilities, as illustrated by the successful roll-out of the Burger King brand in 159 ----- France to improve the performance of Bertrand Casual Foods’ current and future restaurant brands. Our operational model is well-established, historically successful and designed to be replicable across our existing and future restaurant brands. We facilitate a platform driven approach by leveraging our know-how and a synergistic approach to enhance brand operations and performance across all areas and stages of development. We have a historically proven ability to execute rapid roll-out and expansion through our in-house dedicated restaurant network development team, as well as to implement in-house processes for newcomer brands, which involves upgrading operations to meet our group-wide standards, transitioning into the franchised model, diversifying cuisine offerings and redefining brand concepts to resonate with current market preferences that we know well. These strategic initiatives were implemented to improve the financial performance and brand positioning of our existing brands allowing us to grow the proportion of franchised restaurants. This transition into our franchise operational model generates more profitability per restaurant, increasing the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) generated by each brand. For example, as part of Léon’s recent conversion into Léon Fish Brasserie, we redefined its concept and food offering to appeal to a younger and broader customer base, revamped its digital loyalty program to increase customer engagement, and accelerated restaurant openings under the franchise model. Together, these efforts contributed to an increase in ARS, evidenced by a 42% difference between the ARS of €1.2 million generated by Léon restaurants that are not yet converted and €1.7 million generated by the converted Léon Fish Brasserie restaurants, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2023. At the core of our success is our franchise model, which is strategically crafted to be both asset-light and cash generative. We have two principal types of franchise arrangements: Franchise with Lease Management, our franchise model through which we generate additional revenues from real estate lease fees from our franchisees, and Pure Franchise. By focusing the majority of our network on franchising rather than direct restaurant operations, we limit our exposure to the day-to-day fixed costs and investments typically associated with running food service establishments. Instead, these capital expenditure responsibilities are supported by our franchisees, who invest in the assets and infrastructure necessary to operate their locations. This approach allows us to concentrate on providing unparalleled franchisee support, brand stewardship and strategic growth initiatives. Our franchisees benefit from a proven business model that offers the potential for robust returns, while we capitalize on stable and predictable revenue streams through royalty fees, advertising fees and, in the case of Franchise with Lease Management, leasing fees. In turn, our franchisees are contractually required to adhere to the meticulously crafted brand standards for the restaurants they operate, the absence of which can result in termination of our contracts with them. Our model ensures a mutually beneficial partnership that drives collective success across our network of brands. We continue to strategically maintain and operate a limited number of selected directly-owned Company Restaurants, which represented 17% of our restaurant network as of the year ended December 31, 2023. This approach provides us with a platform to pilot new marketing, menu and omni-channel innovations before rolling them out across our franchise network. It also allows us to establish a benchmark of operational success through exemplary models for our franchisees to emulate, showcasing best practices in management, customer service and quality product. While operating a limited number of Company Restaurants will remain a key strategic part of our portfolio for these reasons, we expect the proportion of Company Restaurants in our restaurant network to decrease over time.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our History,18.7.1,,"Our origins date back to 1997, with the launch of our first restaurant, Chesterfield Café. During the period between 1997 and 2010, we launched an additional restaurant concept, Bert’s, and acquired Angelina, a well-known tea salon in France, gaining the financial support of L Catterton along the way in 2006. In 2010, we acquired Au Bureau and Café Leffe, to expand our presence in the brewery space, of which Au Bureau remains an important legacy brand in our portfolio today. In 2013, we reintroduced the Burger King brand to the French market after a 15-year absence, by signing an exclusive master franchise agreement between Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. In 2014, the Burger King App was first launched and in 2015, Burger King France’s first full year of activity, 16 Burger King restaurants were opened in France. Following the landmark agreement to operate Burger King in France, we acquired Financière Quick Group in 2015, an incumbent Burger QSR operator with nearly 400 prime restaurant locations in France as a means of accelerating our penetration of the French market through a process of converting Quick locations into Burger King locations. In the years to come, we demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of our Burger King network in France, both through the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, as well as through new Burger 160 ----- King restaurant openings. This expansion achievement cemented our Group as a leader in the French restaurant industry, known for our ability to roll out and transform brand concepts. In July 2017, we acquired Groupe Flo, a restaurant group focused on casual and traditional dining, including the well-known French chain Hippopotamus. In July 2018, Bridgepoint became a financial partner to further support the development of our brands in France. We continued the growth of our restaurant brand portfolio in the coming years through the creation of the Volfoni restaurant chain in 2018, the acquisition of restaurant chain Léon de Bruxelles in 2019 (which we have transformed into the refined concept Léon) and the acquisition of restaurant chains Pitaya and Itsu in 2022. In addition, in furtherance of our investment in our omni-channel capabilities, in 2022 we acquired The Original Food Court, a proprietary technology that allows customers to order across all our restaurant brands. Prior to 2023, we operated our Burger King brand as a standalone group, separate from the remaining brands in our portfolio. As a result of the 2023 Reorganization, Bertrand Franchise acquired the brands currently in our portfolio, merging all of our existing brands within the same consolidated group. In 2024, we launched a new brand in our portfolio named Jôyô, which is a unique Asian Pub concept serving Japanese and American fusion food. In the course of over 26 years, we have become specialists of the restaurant industry in France, optimally operating several well-known restaurants throughout France and growing our network to address consumer needs across different market sectors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Competitive Strengths,18.8.1,"Attractive market in France with steady growth characteristics, under penetrated by brands and franchises","We believe that the French food service market benefits from strong and sustainable growth characteristics, demonstrating resilience through business cycles and the COVID-19 pandemic. With a market size valued at €49.6 billion in 2023, the French food service market has historically experienced a steady growth rate, and we believe that it has significant untapped potential, particularly for restaurant chains and franchise businesses. Notably, the share of meals eaten outside the home in France remains significantly below that of more mature markets (such as the United Kingdom). With the growing shift in consumer preferences in France favoring more frequent outof-home meals, we believe this supports France’s market potential and room for growth. The French consumer food service market historically grew at a CAGR of approximately 2% per year in the pre-COVID era between the years 2016 and 2019, growing from approximately €50.3 billion in 2016 to approximately €52.9 billion in 2019. Following a brief decline in market growth in 2020, whereby the market briefly contracted to approximately €30.8 billion in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the French food service market has since shown a strong recovery path, continuing to grow at an upward trajectory, reaching almost pre-COVID-19 levels. This recovery highlights the market’s resilience and the sector’s ability to adapt to changing market and consumer preferences, projecting a positive future growth trajectory. In the French food service industry, chains have historically been under-represented compared to independent establishments. However, this trend has accelerated in recent years, with the market share of foodservice chains increasing by over 9 percentage points, from 34% in 2019 to 43% in 2023. This evolution is driven by consumers’ growing preferences for the consistency, quality and diverse culinary experiences that chains are uniquely positioned to offer. The momentum behind chain restaurants is a reflection of deeper changes in consumer behavior and expectations, which we believe points towards continued growth and increased market penetration. Against this backdrop, we believe our food service franchising platform is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this momentum. Our business model, characterized by a diverse portfolio of well-established brands and a demonstrated operational framework that has historically expanded the brands that join our portfolio, positions us as a key player ready to seize the untapped potential within the evolving market. The demand for franchising, in particular, continues to grow, driven by entrepreneurs seeking to align with reputable brands that offer operational excellence, market agility, and strategic support. For example, the number of franchisees in France across various industries has grown by a CAGR of 5% from 1995 through 2023 to approximately 92,000 franchises overall. Further, we believe that there is room for growth in the number of franchisees in the food service sector, with 13% of the French food service sector represented by franchises as of 2023 (compared to 37% of the French grocery 161 ----- retail sector). We have already demonstrated our capacity to meet this demand, with an average annual growth of approximately 110 new franchise restaurants joining our network over the past three years. This significant growth potential for franchisors in the French food industry is underpinned by structural market trends and evolving consumer preferences, which we believe our portfolio brands effectively address. In particular, consumer trends have shown a shift in consumption habits, driven by a focus on convenient food options due to decreasing time available for cooking, a desire for new consumption occasions (from breakfast to dinner) across multiple channels (such as delivery), an increasing share of income allocated to out-of-home food purchases, and the generalization of company-subsidized lunch vouchers, which drive external food consumption. In addition, consumer tastes have evolved toward diverse and global cuisines, which include options for healthy food and gourmet products. Our portfolio responds to these evolving trends, encompassing a variety of eight wellpositioned distinct restaurant brands that cater to a wide range of attractive food service market segments, from QSR to casual dining eateries and addressing all-day consumption occasions across various channels. With the repositioning and modernizing of certain brands that joined our portfolio, such as Hippopotamus or Léon (see “— _Overview”), and the development of new products to meet consumer preference, such as the expanded veggie_ range of menu options for our Burger King brand, we have also demonstrated our ability to adapt our existing brands to evolving consumer needs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We are distinguished not only by the number of restaurants in our network, but also by the unparalleled diversity of our portfolio. With eight distinct restaurant brands in our portfolio, each catering to different customer preferences and dining occasions, our platform offers a variety of culinary experiences that stands out in France. This diverse portfolio enables us to effectively address a broad spectrum of consumer preferences and dining needs, ranging from QSR to casual dining establishments. Anchoring our portfolio is the iconic global QSR brand, Burger King, which represents the largest restaurant brand within our network and the second-largest QSR player in France, with 18-20% market share in the chained burger QSR segment in 2023. We are Burger King’s master franchisee in France and are well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry worldwide. Our Burger King brand is the preferred QSR brand in the French market, with a market-leading net promoter score reflecting 96% brand awareness and digital presence. Since the reintroduction of Burger King in France in 2013, our outstanding performance has positioned France as the second-largest market for the Burger King brand globally, second only to the United States. This remarkable achievement was acknowledged with the “Franchisee of the Year” award at the Burger King World Convention in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our Burger King brand operations are best-in-class, with a robust franchising organization, local supply chain and omni-channel positioning. With a focus on building strong customer engagement through viral targeted marketing and a strong social media and mobile presence, we have significantly grown our presence in the digital market, and thus strengthened our market share, to include over 6 million Burger King active mobile app users globally as of March 31, 2024 and almost two million followers on social media across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X. The historical and continued success of Burger King within our portfolio underscores our significant presence in the competitive QSR market. Despite our current market leadership, there remains substantial whitespace for us to expand, particularly within the QSR segment. Compared to other countries, France remains a comparatively fragmented QSR market, with a lower number of QSR points of sale per 100,000 inhabitants as of 2023 compared, for example, to Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, indicating a significant opportunity for growth for restaurant chains to further consolidate and grow their share of the market. We aim to capitalize on untapped market segments and further strengthen Burger King’s position in the French QSR landscape. Specifically, we believe we are well positioned to reduce the total network size gap between Burger King and its primary competitor, McDonald’s, which currently maintains a larger store network, thereby presenting compelling growth potential. Our strategic focus on expanding our footprint, coupled with the existing market dynamics, positions us favorably to capture a larger share of the market and drive sustained growth. 162 ----- Our robust portfolio includes seven other unique brands, presented below (see “—Highly-replicable business _model with proven capacity to integrate and develop acquired brands”), each with its own distinct concept,_ contributing to our overall market strength and diversity. Our strong brand portfolio includes Au Bureau, one of the largest brasserie/pub brands in France with 79-81% of market share in the branded café-bars market, Hippopotamus, one of the largest networks of steakhouses in prime locations, Léon, one of the leading fish and seafood brands in France and Pitaya, a fast-casual restaurant chain with a strong network with international presence and 31-33% of market share. We strive to operate with a mix of brands that include well-known historic brands, new organically developed brands and international well-known brands debuting in France. These complementary brands span a variety of food service segments, including Asian QSR, Italian casual dining, pubs and brasseries, and seafood restaurants, among others. This multiplicity of brands not only enriches our offering but also enhances our resilience by diversifying our revenue streams and reducing dependency on a single market segment. The success of these brands, alongside Burger King, exemplifies our proven ability to develop, manage, and grow a wide range of restaurant concepts. Together, they form a robust foundation for our continued expansion and reinforce our position as a leader in the French restaurant franchising industry.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The collective strength of our brands, underpinned by a shared operational framework, ensures efficiency, consistency, and innovation at every level of the franchising experience. We provide our franchisees with food service industry expertise throughout their relationship with us to enhance their success, from site selection of a new restaurant through continued operational support. Our franchisees also benefit from the ability to diversity cuisine formats and models across our brand portfolio, with the ability to cover a specific geographical area with different brands. One of the cornerstone capabilities of our platform is our strategic approach to network roll-out and site sourcing. We boast an in-house dedicated market-leading property team, with over 20 years of experience and deep local knowledge of the areas in which we wish to grow our operations. Leveraging advanced proprietary sourcing and market insights, we identify prime locations that promise high foot traffic and optimal visibility for our franchisees. In partnership with prime institutional real estate investors and with a robust development team consisting of approximately 60 full-time employees with national coverage, we are able to access some of the most attractive locations as tenant of choice to quickly and efficiently open new restaurants for any of the brands in our portfolio. As a result of our efficient methodology, we have opened 103 new restaurants on average from 2016 through 2023, which we believe reflects one of the largest roll-out plans of other key food service peers in Europe. In the realm of brand management, our expertise ensures that each brand maintains its unique identity while benefiting from cross-brand strategies to increase customer brand awareness and engagement. With decades of expertise running restaurants driven by an entrepreneurial management team, we provide an innovative approach to brand management to sync the dining experience of each of our brands with the distinct customer preferences 163 ----- that each brand is tailored to. We aim to modernize the historic brands in our portfolio, with a focus on product and customer experience, to upgrade their brand image and sync the dining experience with our knowledge of what customers seek. In the context of a rapidly evolving food service landscape, we have strategically positioned our restaurant brand franchise network at the forefront of digital innovation and delivery partnerships. Recognizing the growing consumer demand for convenience and speed, we have invested heavily in developing a robust digital infrastructure that encompasses user-friendly online ordering platforms, mobile apps with intuitive interfaces, and integrated loyalty programs. In 2023, approximately 88% of our restaurants offered delivery services, with approximately €210 million in SWS generated across our portfolio over the same period from delivery sales. This digital ecosystem is designed to enhance the customer experience, making it seamless for patrons to engage with our brands, place orders, and receive their favorite meals wherever they are. Furthermore, our advanced delivery capabilities, supported by partnerships with leading delivery services, ensure that we can meet the high expectations for promptness and quality. This comprehensive approach to digital and delivery services not only drives additional revenue streams but also strengthens the competitive edge of our franchise network, ensuring that our brands remain relevant and preferred in a market that increasingly values digital convenience and reliable delivery options.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Our franchise revenue model is based on the royalties and fees that we generate from our franchisees, which in turn are calculated on the basis of a percentage of their total SWS. As a result, our financial performance is inherently correlated to the sales performance of our franchisees and we engage in a meticulous new franchisee selection process to ensure that each franchisee in our network can uphold brand standards and deliver high-quality customer experience. For our Burger King brand, for example, we receive a high number of applications that we evaluate, with only about 7% of applications received ultimately approved to join our network. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 47% of our franchisee network operated more than one restaurant site. Based on precedent from our Burger King brand, we believe there is capacity to increase the number of restaurants per franchisee to more than 3 restaurants on average, providing growth potential for both new and existing franchisees. The largest franchisee within our network operates 12 restaurants, and we do not anticipate franchisees generally exceeding this level, ensuring a balanced and competitive franchise structure. Franchisees joining our network gain access to extensive benefits and expert support from a leading franchise system, positioning them for success from the outset of their franchise journey. At the core of these benefits is our commitment to providing best-in-class support, ensuring that every franchisee is well-equipped to thrive in the competitive food service industry. At the restaurant opening stage, franchisees benefit from up to six months of intensive training, laying a solid foundation for operational success. Our complete training support extends across each brand within the network, drawing on years of proven expertise in restaurant management. Additionally, 164 ----- franchisees gain access to financing partners with whom we have established historical relationships and are confident in our network’s robust operating track record. This comprehensive support system is designed to minimize the hurdles of starting a new business, ensuring franchisees are thoroughly equipped to meet market demands. Once operational, our restaurants have historically displayed attractive unit economics and rapid payback periods. Franchisees experience a rapid ramp-up on new openings (with a ramp-up period of less than a month for our Burger King brands and within three to six months for the other restaurant brands in our portfolio), thanks to our efficient operational model and the strong brand recognition of the brands in our portfolio. The network’s attractive cash management model enables franchisees to achieve rapid payback on their initial investment. Historically, franchisees have achieved payback for Burger King brand restaurants within three to four years, while franchisees for the rest of the brands in our portfolio (excluding Itsu and Pitaya) have achieved payback within four and a half to six years. Further, our Burger King brand restaurants typically generate approximately €3.8 million in ARS on average, while the other restaurants brands in our portfolio typically generate between approximately €0.8 million to €2.1 million in ARS, based on the same period. These attractive economics are bolstered by the attractive, adapted and flexible franchise terms that we offer franchisees under our different restaurant brands. We offer our franchisees two principal types of franchise arrangements: Franchise with Lease Management, our preferred franchise model for our Burger King brand, through which we generate additional revenues from real estate lease fees from our franchisees, and Pure Franchise, our preferred franchise model for the rest of the brands in our portfolio. Under the latter model, franchisees are able to own the business asset rights over the business. Each of our different brands also demand a different up-front equity investment, with Burger King brand requiring €250,000 up-front (of which €50,000 are entry fees) and the remainder of our brands requiring between €100,000 to €350,000 up-front, depending on the brand (of which €50,000 to €60,000 are entry fees).

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Competitive Strengths,18.8.5,Asset-light business model with high cash conversion and limited exposure to restaurant operations,"Our successful franchise-based business model, supported by a robust network of committed franchise partners, generates recurring and predictable revenues with high EBITDA margin, with 15% of revenues from franchisees as a percentage of SWS and 28% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 83% of our network was represented by Franchise Restaurants, while approximately 17% was represented by Company Restaurants. As a large majority of our restaurants are Franchise Restaurants, we operate with a strategic advantage by being largely insulated from the day-to-day operational costs associated with running a restaurant. This arrangement, where individual franchisees are responsible for the direct expenses of their establishments, allows us to focus on overarching brand development, marketing strategies, and network expansion without the financial burden and complexities of daily restaurant management. Consequently, our financial model is characterized by reduced operational risk and a streamlined cost structure, enhancing our ability to invest in long-term growth initiatives and support our franchisees from a strategic vantage point. The table below demonstrates the key features of each of our restaurant models: Company Restaurants, Franchise with Lease Management and Pure Franchise. 165 ----- (1) Advertising contribution from franchisees is entirely spent in marketing campaigns to promote the brands nationally. (2) Under Franchise with Lease Management contracts, we pay occupancy costs for the ownership of the business asset rights. (3) MFA royalties are paid for brands that we do not directly owned (i.e., between 3.5 and 4.5% of SWS for Burger King and approximately 3% of SWS for Itsu). Our focus on building and expanding our franchise network centers around an asset-light approach, pursuant to which we do not own the land, building or physical assets of the restaurants within our network. We derive the benefits of this asset-light model under both types of our franchise arrangements. This asset-light model allows for higher cash conversion and reduces or eliminates for locations with third-party landlord agreements our capital expenditures for such franchise openings. We have a strong cash conversion (measured as pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA minus our capital expenditures divided by pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA) of over 80%. In the case of Franchise with Lease Management restaurants, we partner with a diverse base of real estate investor partners who own the land and buildings where our restaurants operate. These properties are then leased to us, following which we sub-lease the land to our franchisees under our Franchise with Lease Management Model, allowing us to retain ownership of the business goodwill. As such, we are able to generate lease management fees while reducing our capital burden. Our franchisees are thereafter responsible for ongoing capital expenditures related to equipment, kitchen, furniture and fixtures. We generally incur no capital expenditure for two-thirds of our openings under the Lease Management Model. Indeed, in 2023, 30 out of 44 Burger King France openings were executed using the asset-light Pure Franchise model. Our franchisees under our Pure Franchise model lease their restaurant locations directly from third-party landlords. They directly invest in the physical assets required to establish and operate their individual locations, bearing responsibility for all capital expenditures, including building and development. We incur no opening capital expenditure under the Pure Franchise model.

Since 2010, we have successfully acquired, integrated and developed a number of successful brands, with demonstrated substantial performance improvement. This model is built on a foundation of meticulous sourcing of potential acquisitions. Our experienced in-house M&A team has a demonstrated capacity to identify some of the most compelling concepts for consumers and franchisees that show promise in terms of market fit and growth potential, backed by a privileged access to deal flow thanks to our market positioning and reputation as the “buyer of choice.” Once a brand is incorporated into our portfolio, we apply our playbook for successful integration by implementing our in-house best practices and processes. With over 20 years of experience in network development, we work with newly acquired restaurant brands to upgrade their operational processes, such as reporting and analytics. We also plug them into our network of resource pooling, leveraging on existing support functions. This ensures that each brand is seamlessly integrated into our network, benefiting from our wealth of experience and established systems for operational excellence. Our approach is also committed to redefining brand concepts to ensure they resonate with current market trends and consumer preferences. This involves a thorough analysis of the brand's core identity and offerings, followed by strategic adjustments that enhance its appeal without losing its unique character. Our goal is to elevate each brand to its fullest potential in alignment with our brand standards by updating menu items, revamping marketing strategies, redesigning the customer experience or enhancing the omni-channel distribution offering to customers. Developing the franchise network is the final piece of our model. With the brand concept refined and best practices in place, we focus on expanding the franchise network through targeted recruitment of franchisees in line with 167 ----- our recruitment criteria.

We plan to employ a dynamic strategy to expand the number of brands in our portfolio that can be franchised, leveraging both acquisitions and organic brand development as pivotal growth drivers. Through targeted M&A activities, we plan to strategically acquire brands that complement our existing portfolio, offering new concepts that respond to local consumer demand or enhancing our geographical footprint through increased network density. This approach allows us to rapidly scale our network, bringing in established brands with loyal customer bases and proven business models. Concurrently, we plan to continue to invest in the organic development of new brands, nurturing innovative concepts from the ground up to address emerging market trends and consumer demands. This dual strategy of external growth through acquisitions and internal growth through brand innovation ensures a continuous pipeline of fresh and diverse offerings within our franchise network. We also plan to further expand our restaurant network in collaboration with current and new franchisees to continue to increase our market share in France. We expect that a higher density of restaurants will further contribute to brand awareness, support customer loyalty and increase traffic in our existing restaurants, while our new restaurants will benefit from existing strong brands, reputation and know-how. We have a rigorous approach to expansion and expect to promote new restaurant growth primarily through opening Franchise with Lease Management restaurants for our Burger King brand, allowing us to maintain significant control over our network with limited capital expenditure. For the other brands in our network, we will focus on opening predominantly Pure Franchise restaurants, which further reduce our capital expenditures. With regard to Company Restaurants, these require significantly higher capital expenditures and introduces additional leases and personnel costs to our cost structure compared to franchise arrangements; consequently, we intend to limit the number of new Company Restaurants. 168 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We also seek to expand the product offerings in our existing restaurants to continue to tailor our offerings to evolving customer preferences by relying on our expertise in creating innovative, premium convenience food products that match customers’ demand, which we believe will be a key driver of our revenues. For example, we intend to continue to expand our healthy and nutritious product offering through the introduction of additional healthy options and preservative-free ingredients to further capture key markets, such as families, and anticipate market trends toward local sourcing, value-for-money products and healthy food options as well as meatless alternatives and products with no animal protein. We also plan to further strengthen our multi-channel approach through the enhancement of takeaway options and the development of new digital sales channels to further drive our growth. Finally, we intend to capitalize on increased consumption opportunities by the continued operation of our restaurants in the afternoon or late-night hours. We are also committed to continuing to capitalize on the inherent synergies within our diverse portfolio of brands. By leveraging shared resources, expertise, and operational efficiencies across our network, we aim to enhance the value proposition for our franchisees and deliver a superior experience to our customers. This includes optimizing our supply chain logistics, unifying marketing efforts to amplify brand visibility for each of the brands in our portfolio, and fostering innovation through the cross-pollination of ideas and best practices among our brands. Our commitment to harnessing these synergies not only drives operational excellence and cost savings but also positions us to respond more dynamically to market changes and consumer trends.

While we have already successfully integrated the use of in-app orders and preorders, Click & Collect orders, in-store tablets that allow customers to skip the line and home delivery options with third-party aggregators for our Burger King brand, we also see opportunity in expanding our digital channels for the other brands in our network. Following the positive growth of these initiatives with the Burger King brand, we plan to replicate this model across our entire brand portfolio. Additionally, we have recently acquired The Original Food Court, a proprietary technology that enables customers to order seamlessly from all our brands, creating a “digital food court.” Our commitment to innovation in the omni-channel space positions our brands as industry leaders, providing convenience and accessibility to customers while promoting growth and profitability for our franchise partners. We believe that the current trends and growth observed in our digital sales, accelerated as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate a distribution channel that adapts to the changing preferences of our customers and is complementary to our in-restaurant dining channel.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Our Strategy,18.9.5,Focus on cost control and economies of scale,"We intend to continue to improve our gross margin and profitable expansion through leveraging our Bertrand Franchise platform to generate cost optimization, particularly for our supply chain and marketing. By streamlining these critical areas, we aim to achieve significant efficiencies and cost reductions that directly benefit our bottom line and enhance the profitability of our franchise network. While franchisees bear the food and logistic costs for their restaurants, we organize and negotiate the sourcing for both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants through pre-approved suppliers and relationships with certain third-party logistics providers. Our food and logistics costs are significant, and we believe that we could drive restaurants’ gross margin through enhanced control of our logistics costs by exploiting economies of scale in line with the growth of our restaurant network, further developing local supplier networks and implementing cost control measures to reduce food waste. For example, we require all of our Burger King franchisees to source their raw materials from suppliers that BKC has previously approved and with whom we intend to continue to leverage our extensive restaurant network and economies of scale to obtain favorable commercial terms. In addition, suppliers have sought to invest in long-term partnerships with us, which has allowed us to reduce food costs and secure dedicated product lines to satisfy our needs. Apart from focusing on the optimization of our supply chain, we intend to further develop our communication and advertising campaigns to promote our brands, product offerings and commercial offers in order to reinforce awareness of our brands, build on their existing brand image and increase customer traffic, which we believe will also contribute to the improvement of our gross margin and profitable expansion.

We will continue to deploy this model through the continued expansion of Franchise Restaurants that permit us to actively manage our network, target specific whitespace and encourage the formation of denser clusters of restaurants, as well as to limit swings in our working capital. Where possible, in the case of Franchise with Lease Management restaurants, we will also favor third party landlord agreements allowing us to effectively reduce our new opening capex spend to nothing with new openings under the asset-light model lease management. In addition, we believe that tight cash control measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the strong cash buffer built and maintained through the crisis, will allow us to continue focusing on deleveraging in the periods to come.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Our Operating Models,18.10.1,Franchise Restaurants,"Our Franchise Restaurants operate under two types of franchise arrangements: Franchise with Lease Management (used for approximately 47% of our Franchise Restaurants as of December 31, 2023, as compared to 53% of as of December 31, 2020) and Pure Franchise (used for approximately 53% of our Franchise Restaurants as of December 31, 2023 as compared to 47% as of December 31, 2020). While the obligations under our Franchise with Lease Management and Pure Franchise agreements are substantially similar, the main differences between the two arrangements concern the ownership of key rights pertinent to the operation of restaurants, including business assets rights (fonds de commerce), leasehold rights and ownership of business goodwill. The ownership 170 ----- of these rights in turn has an impact on the level of fees we collect from our franchisees, the distribution of capital expenditures as between us and our franchisees and the role we play in the construction and development of a new restaurant site. Notwithstanding these differences, both of these arrangements support our asset-light franchise model, as we do not directly own the restaurant real estate assets under any of our contractual relationships with franchisees. We have historically used both types of franchise arrangements and intend to continue to do so as our different brands tend to be better suited for one or the other. Our current focus is to prioritize our Franchise with Lease Management arrangement for the Burger King brand, while we plan to prioritize our Pure Franchise model for the remaining brands in our portfolio. _Franchise with Lease Management_ In a Franchise with Lease Management arrangement, we maintain ownership of the business assets rights (fonds _de commerce), leasehold rights and business goodwill. In general, we are the tenant of record with respect to the_ restaurant real estate which we typically lease from third party landlords (including, in certain cases, Foncière Bertrand, a Group affiliate which provides real estate services tailored for building restaurants) and we, in turn, sub-lease the restaurant real estate to the franchisee. As a result, the franchisee maintains contractual ties to us with both a franchise agreement to operate the restaurant under our brand and business asset rights in exchange for certain obligations and a tenancy agreement to rent the restaurant space at any specific location. Since the franchisee does not own the building or the business asset rights, this model encourages franchisee retention as franchisees who wish to keep operating their restaurant will need to renew their contract with us. Franchise with Lease Management is our core development model for future growth for the Burger King brand, providing network management, cost reduction and cash generation advantages. Of our 82 new franchise restaurant openings in the year ended December 31, 2023, 46% of them were opened under a Franchise with Lease Management arrangement. Under this arrangement, we are able to better direct network density by proposing new locations to new or existing franchisees. We take a more active role in site selection, development and construction under this arrangement through our existing real estate partners, which allows us to manage our expansion more strategically, rapidly and efficiently rolling out new restaurant sites with a consistent level of quality. Our franchisees who operate their restaurants under this arrangement pay us for the use of the real estate through a lease management fee based on a percentage of SWS, typically subject to a minimum yearly rent that coincides with our fixed costs under the relevant lease. In addition to these rent payments, the franchisee is also responsible for brand royalty payments and advertising contributions. These fees compensate us for the value of our business assets rights (fonds de commerce), which the franchisee operates, as well as for franchisee access to our knowhow and brand management services. While we retain some limited responsibility for building capital expenditures under this model, we are able to pass on most costs to our landlords, while our franchisees are responsible for other maintenance capital expenditures related to the kitchen, furniture and fixtures. _Pure Franchise_ In a Pure Franchise arrangement, the franchisee owns the business assets rights (fonds de commerce), leasehold rights and business goodwill and as such is fully responsible for the operation of the business and its relevant expenses, including all of the capital expenditures related to building, kitchen, furniture and fixtures. Our franchisees under our Pure Franchise arrangements are the tenants of record on the lease for the land on which the restaurant operates, paying rent directly to a third-party landlord. While we have ultimate decision power when choosing a new location for a restaurant, franchisees may propose a certain location that we may consider when deciding whether or not to open in a specific location. Our contractual ties under our Pure Franchise arrangements are limited to a franchise agreement, whereby franchisees contract to operate under our restaurant brand name. In a Pure Franchise arrangement, franchisor revenue is primarily generated from brand royalty and payments and advertising contributions as the lease revenue stream is not present in this arrangement. Pure Franchise is our core development model for future growth for most of the brands in our network. Of our 82 new franchise restaurant openings in the year ended December 31, 2023, 54% of them were opened under a Pure Franchise arrangement. While the Burger King brand primarily operates under a Franchise with Lease Management model (77%), in specific cases such as site concessions that preclude us from leasing the property directly, we also engage in Pure Franchise arrangements for this brand. Our Pure Franchise model is particularly attractive for franchisees seeking to leverage our established brands while maintaining a higher degree of autonomy. 171 ----- _Asset-Light Model_ Our Franchise Restaurant model centers around an asset-light approach, pursuant to which we do not own the land, building or physical assets of the restaurants within our network. We derive the benefits of this asset-light model under both types of our franchise arrangements. Under our Franchise with Lease Management Model, we partner with a diverse base of real estate investor partners who own the land and buildings where our restaurants operate. These properties are then leased to us, following which we sub-lease the land to our franchisees under our Franchise with Lease Management Model. As such, we are able to generate lease management fees while reducing our capital burden. Our franchisees are thereafter responsible for ongoing capital expenditures. Our franchisees under our Pure Franchise model lease their restaurant locations directly from third-party landlords and directly invest in the physical assets required to establish and operate their individual locations, bearing responsibility for all ongoing capital expenditures, including building and development. Real estate expenditures traditionally represent substantial fixed costs for food service operators, and this asset light model has allowed us to significantly improve our cash conversion and EBITDA margins. This approach also allows us to easily and rapidly replicate our franchising model to new restaurants and brands that join our network. We seek to uniformly implement this model across all of our restaurant brands by transitioning any preceding directly-owned ownership models to our asset-light model. _Royalties and Fees Paid by Franchisees_ We generate revenue from our Franchise Restaurants through a structured franchise royalty and fee system, designed to support the growth and maintenance of our network of brand restaurants. The ongoing royalties and fees we generate from our franchisees is generally fixed as a percentage of SWS, which level varies depending on the brand and type of franchise arrangement (either Franchise with Lease Management or Pure Franchise). This model ensures a consistent and predictable revenue stream, while also providing franchisees with the infrastructure support they require to maintain and grow their SWS. When a franchisee opens a Franchise Restaurant, we charge a new one-off franchise fee, which generally ranges between €40,000-€50,000. In connection with Burger King Franchise Restaurants, we transfer a portion of these new franchisee fees to BKC to cover entrance fees owed in connection with the opening of each new Burger King Franchise Restaurant and retain a portion as compensation for our role as master franchisee. See “— Burger King.” Subsequent to the initial investment, franchisees pay certain fees on an on-going basis that generally fall within three distinct categories: brand royalties, advertising fees and, in the case of our franchisees that operate under the Franchise with Lease Management model, lease management fees. Additionally, for many of our brands, we receive “commercial cooperations” which correspond to income derived from supplier rebates. The fixed percentage of brand royalties that we collect monthly from our franchisees ranges across our network and brands, generally from 5.0% to 9.0% of SWS. In the case of Burger King, for which franchisees pay monthly royalties of 9% of SWS, we pay, under the terms of the Master Franchise Agreement, one half of this amount to BK Europe, the affiliate of BKC, leaving us with a net amount of 4.5% of SWS in brand royalties. For most of our other brands, brand royalties range between 5.0% to 6.5% of SWS. Our Pitaya brand bears a slightly different structure where brand royalties paid to us by franchisees are slightly lower than other brands (2.0% of SWS). However, franchisees of our Pitaya brand also pay know-how fees and support fees, each representing 2.0% of SWS annually. In addition to brand royalties, we also expect our franchisees to actively participate in the development of the brands that they operate by contributing to our marketing and advertising campaign. Such advertising fees range across our network and brands from 1.0% to 4.0% of SWS annually. For our Franchises with Lease Management, our standard arrangement provides that franchises pay lease management fees equal to a percentage of their sales, ranging from 12.0% to 15.0% of SWS across our network and brands. As we are the tenant of record on the leases for Franchise Restaurants operated under Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, we generally pay on a quarterly basis the landlords for the use of these properties an amount between 5.5% and 6.5% of the franchisee SWS that we generate. In addition to royalties and fees paid by franchisees, we benefit from rebates granted by suppliers to our Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon and Volfoni brands. See “—Operational Synergies of our Multi-Brand Franchise _Model—Supply Chain & Procurement Platform.”_ 172 ----- _Franchisee Selection Criteria_ As of December 31, 2023, we partnered with over 420 franchisees across our restaurant brand network, of which 47% operated more than one restaurant and 8% operated more than five restaurants. Our franchisees operate, on average, two restaurants. Our largest franchisee operates 12 restaurants. We actively seek to expand our restaurant network by identifying strategic, high-caliber franchisee partners. Since our franchise revenue model is based on the royalties and fees that we generate from our franchisees, which in turn are calculated on the basis of a percentage of their total SWS, our financial performance is inherently correlated to the sales performance of our franchisees. As a result, it is imperative that we partner with franchisees that demonstrate the acumen to drive sales growth, uphold brand standards and deliver high-quality customer experience. Where possible, we seek to work with franchisees that have the willingness and capacity to operate within multiple restaurant brands within our portfolio. Their multi-brand operations enable them to leverage cross-brand knowhow, optimize market coverage and diversify their revenue streams, which in turn enhances the overall stability and resilience of our franchise network. These franchisees often have a deeper understanding of local market dynamics and consumer preferences, which in turn helps them better tailor the customer experience across different brands and formats. Before entering into a new agreement with a potential franchisee, we conduct rigorous due diligence procedures to ensure that they meet our strategic criteria. While we do not grant any of our franchisees for the Burger King network the right to an exclusive territory, we may grant such rights for other brands in our portfolio, such as Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Volfoni and Léon. Our franchise agreements are typically between nine and ten years in length. For our Burger King brand, our franchise agreements under our Franchise with Lease Management arrangements are generally valid for a period of nine years which can be automatically renewed only if certain cumulative conditions relating to the franchisee, its financial situation and its compliance with our operational standards are met. The agreement can be renewed only once. If prescribed renewal conditions are not met, the agreement terminates at the end of the first nine-year period. The renewal of our franchise agreements is generally contingent upon the fulfillment of several criteria, including that franchisees are up to date with all required payments to us and investments for their restaurants, that they are financially solvent, that they have historically maintained a level of performance in line with our standards (such as achieving minimum required scores in annual checks, covering key operational areas such as hygiene, safety, quality, and cleanliness, as well as adherence to other brand standards) and that the teams they have hired to operate restaurants are deemed sufficient in number. In addition, franchisees must demonstrate a commitment to the strategy of the brand they operate, and there must be no ongoing disputes (judicial or otherwise) between us and our franchisees. Our franchise agreements for Pure Franchises are generally entered into for a period of ten years and may continue up to a duration of twenty years. We may terminate our agreements with our franchisees for certain reasons, including failure to pay royalties and other fees and failure to operate restaurants in accordance with our standards. For our Burger King brand, BKC may also direct us to terminate any of our franchise agreements under certain circumstances to protect the integrity of the Burger King brand. Our franchise agreements also contain certain provisions that prohibit the franchisee from operating another restaurant business that would compete directly with our business, or in a location where the restaurant would compete with an existing restaurant of the same brand within our portfolio. In addition, our agreements impose certain non-compete restrictions on our employees. For example, for our Burger King brand, during the period of an employee’s employment contract and for six months after such contract has been terminated, an employee may not go and work in another Burger King restaurant.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Each of the brands in our portfolio possess a distinct identity that resonates with its dedicated customer base. We are also focused on curating a portfolio of brands of high-growth brands that have the potential to lead their respective markets. As of December 31, 2023, we operated eight brands in our portfolio, as follows: _Our Main Brand, Burger King France_ Burger King stands as one of the largest global fast-food chains, positioned as a direct competitor to McDonald’s with a focus on offering a more premium, flame-grilled taste experience. Its marketing emphasizes customer choice and personalization under the slogan “Have it your way,” aiming to differentiate itself with the promise of higher-quality ingredients and a unique cooking method that sets its burgers apart from others in the QSR industry. We are the master franchisee for the Burger King brand in France. Burger King is an important strategic brand in our portfolio, with 544 restaurants (including one Quick restaurant under conversion) representing 51% of our total restaurant network as of March 31, 2024. Burger King generated €1,969 million in Pro Forma SWS and €244 million in Pro Forma EBITDA for the twelve months ended 31, 2024, representing 70% of our Pro Forma SWS and 84% of our Pro Forma EBITDA, respectively. Through our rigorous site selection, a commitment to high quality and a strong focus on innovation across product offerings and omni-channel capabilities, we were able to successfully increase our Burger King France SWS from €1,136 million as of December 31, 2019 to €1,969 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, with an increase in our points of sale from 384 to 544 (including one Quick restaurants under conversion) over the same periods. The average basket size (excluding VAT) of Burger King in France is €16. Burger King has played a pivotal role in our historical growth trajectory, demonstrating our capability to apply our deep knowledge of the food service industry and blueprint of key operational processes to develop the Burger King brand in France after a 15-year absence into a market-leading, high-quality brand tailored to the unique preferences of a French clientele. In 2013, our principal shareholder Groupe Bertrand reintroduced the Burger King brand to the French market by signing an exclusive master franchise agreement between Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. Our network expansion plan was driven in part by a strategy to acquire an incumbent Burger QSR operator with nearly 400 restaurant locations in France in order to convert their existing restaurants, which we did in 2015, when we acquired Financière Quick Group. We demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of our Burger King network in France, through our two-pronged strategy of converting Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand and opening new Burger King restaurant. Burger King also serves as a testament to the strength and resilience of the operational model that we have developed, as demonstrated through Burger King’s performance in France throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To cope with external restrictions during this period, we further enhanced our multi-channel offerings, including through the expansion of our drive-through and takeaway services by using new Click & Collect channels, the development of our home delivery options and our integration with third-party delivery aggregators. The further enhancement of such offerings allowed us to protect our top line during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions by offsetting the reduction in on-premise customer traffic and allowing customers to access our products through alternate channels. In addition, we were also focused on supporting our franchisees through the challenges of the pandemic, closely monitoring their financial health and adapting our support initiatives as the impact of the pandemic on our franchisees’ performance evolved. For example, during the period of the first lockdown in France, we implemented temporary royalty adjustments for our franchisees. We also temporarily waived the 174 ----- obligation of our franchisees under our Franchise with Lease Management arrangements to pay us a minimum lease management fee. As a result of such measures, none of our franchisees experienced a default of their payment obligations to third parties. Collectively, these measures allowed us to rapidly ramp up following each of the most severe COVID-19-related restrictive periods in France, with monthly sales immediately following each lockdown nearly recovering to prelockdown periods. For example, in June 2020, our SWS under the Burger King brand recovered to €73 million as compared to the €85 million pre-lockdown level in February 2020. Similarly, in December 2020, the month during which the second lockdown restrictions were lifted, our SWS reached €86 million as compared to the €94 million pre-lockdown SWS recorded in October 2020. Further, despite the implementation of a curfew in France ending in June 2021, we were able to achieve consistently increasing SWS levels from April 2021 through August 2021, which we believe emphasizes the resilience of our business model, further supported by the long-term integration of the measures we adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. _The Burger King Master Franchise Agreement_ In November 2013, our subsidiary Burger King France entered into a master franchise and development agreement with BK Europe for a period of 20 years, the duration of which has since been amended in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to extend for an additional year through December 31, 2034, with the option to extend the term for an additional 10 years at expiration, subject to certain conditions (such agreement, as amended from time to time, the “Master Franchise Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Master Franchise Agreement, we have the exclusive right to develop the Burger King brand in France and may grant third parties the right to operate Burger King restaurants in exchange for the payment of royalties and license fees. Pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement, we may enter into franchise agreements with third parties to operate and manage their own Burger King restaurants in France. As the master franchisee for France, we are responsible for the management and strategic development of the network’s brand development, promotion, execution of a marketing and advertising strategy and certain other services, for which we are remunerated by franchisees through fees and royalties. We are also entitled to use related trademarks, logos and trade names and receive access to BKC’s know-how and the processes that it has developed. The Master Franchise Agreement imposes certain obligations that we must respect in order to maintain the exclusive rights to develop the Burger King brand in France. Certain default provisions under the Master Franchise Agreement include, among others: (i) failure to pay BKC amounts we owe under the Master Franchise Agreement; (ii) transferring or assigning our rights under the Master Franchise Agreement; (iii) if we or any of our affiliates acquire an interest in a competitor; or (iv) if we enter into insolvency proceedings. If the Master Franchise Agreement is terminated for any reason, we do not lose the right to continue the operation of the Burger King restaurants that we have already established. However, we will lose our exclusivity right and be unable to further expand our presence and market share in France. The Master Franchise Agreement also contains certain covenants related to the expansion of Burger King in France that we must respect in order to maintain the exclusive development rights for the Burger King brand in France. _Our Other Brands_ - **_Au Bureau: Au Bureau is a pub and restaurant chain that offers a convivial atmosphere reminiscent of traditional British pubs, combined with a diverse menu that includes classic pub fare and French bistro favorites.

We centralize our brand management to a dedicated internal team that seeks to reinforce brand differentiation by clearly defining brand concepts to allow for consistent messaging and quality across each of our brands, enhancing brand recognition and awareness. When we integrate a new restaurant brand in our portfolio, we focus on improving its brand concept by aligning its menu, products and pricing architecture to our assessment of its target market. This process has historically generated improvement in our newcomer brands. 177 ----- We take advantage of our knowledge across different food segments to centralize product development to ensure that the menus of our restaurant brands both correspond to their concept and adapt to evolving consumer preferences. This centralized approach also allows us to closely monitor our price positioning to maintain our competitive position in the market. Beyond the menu we offer our customers, we also seek to innovate on production processes and methods in our kitchens by monitoring and identifying the best equipment to optimize work organization to deliver the best dining experience to our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,Operational Synergies of our Multi-Brand Franchise Model,18.20.2,Advertising and Communication Strategy,"As part of our brand management activities, we are focused on marketing, advertising and promotion for each of our brands that reinforce their brand positioning. We believe that an effective marketing and advertising strategy is essential for the success of our brands as marketing and advertising programs are a key traffic driver and enable us to attract new customers to our restaurants and retain existing customers’ loyalty. In order to reinforce awareness of our brands, build on our image and generate footfall, we invest annually in innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns. Our advertising expenses are partly financed by our franchisees, who are required under the terms of their franchise agreements to contribute a percentage of sales (between 1.0% to 3.5% of SWS annually depending on the brand and franchise arrangement) as advertising fees, which we then use to market, advertise and promote initiatives and programs for the brands they are part of. Restaurants’ SWS and results of operations can be significantly affected by the frequency and effectiveness of our advertising and promotional programs. We use three levels of advertising: (i) system-wide advertising, which is coordinated and centralized in our headquarters outside of Paris; (ii) digital and social media advertising; and (iii) local advertising, which franchisees handle with materials we create or approve. Franchisees may not use their own advertising materials without our prior consent. In addition, in the case of Burger King, we must obtain BKC’s prior approval for all of our marketing, advertising and promotional programs and initiatives. As a result, our marketing efforts for the Burger King brand are often developed and rolled out in close coordination with BKC. Our communication strategy is centered around the development and consistent presence of social media, targeted digital marketing and efficient loyalty programs, which we have prioritized and significantly developed in recent years. We focus on tailoring each independent brand’s communication campaigns based on its individual communication style that we believe best aligns with its brand concept and positioning. We create videos for sharing on social media outlets such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, X and Facebook, which we believe are the most effective ways to reach our customers as well as engage in influence marketing. We regularly post information regarding new openings, promotions and new products, interact with customers and answer queries from users. In addition, we manage the development and maintenance of our brands’ mobile applications, which we seek to expand to include features such as Click & Collect in-app ordering and customer loyalty programs. Under our targeted marketing approach, we identify the most attractive customers for each brand, building a tailored strategy for each identified group to strengthen customer engagement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,Operational Synergies of our Multi-Brand Franchise Model,18.20.3,Supply Chain & Procurement Platform,"Our supply chain infrastructure is critical to support our and our franchisees’ ability to meet customer demand with efficiency and reliability. Our supply and procurement strategy are designed to reduce complexity and to capitalize on our broad network to optimize operations, reduce costs and ensure the timely delivery of high-quality products. We intend to incorporate any newcomer brands into our existing supply chain and procurement model to further enhance the benefits of our scale. We pre-approve a limited number of suppliers for each brand for the key products that they use. This allows us to retain a certain degree of consistent quality control across our brands as approval of suppliers is subject to our rigorous due diligence process. Our franchisees then are able to order raw materials and supplies independently and directly from our approved suppliers or logistics platform. In certain cases, they are able to order products directly from wholesalers or other suppliers. _Procurement_ We take advantage of the size and breadth of our network to consolidate purchasing power across our network. This allows us to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers that we are then able to pass on to our franchise partners. As part of these favorable terms, our suppliers grant us certain rebates in connection with large-scale purchases. We have also put in place supply pooling for products used by multiple brands, such as the paper and packaging material for sale of our products and beverages. 178 ----- Our Burger King brand currently operates under a separate pre-existing supply chain and procurement platform. Pursuant to our franchise agreements, Burger King operations are required to source raw materials from BKC approved suppliers. As a result, all Burger King restaurants independently purchase supplies for their needs from approved suppliers. These purchases include food products and the paper and packaging materials for the sale of our products, as well as cleaning supplies and other products for the maintenance of equipment. We are able to tap into the network of BKC approved suppliers both in France and in additional European markets, in particular Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, where approved suppliers provide us with approved raw materials on a regular basis, subject to their capacities. We have also developed a significant French network of approved suppliers, securing access to supplies while reducing transport costs. The development of our network is beneficial to the overall success of the Burger King brand as our suppliers will be able to source other Burger King markets in the event of a shortage or other interruption in the supply chain. We anticipate that the locally sourced component of our raw materials from French suppliers will continue to increase along with the growth of the Burger King network. In order to improve and optimize our supply chain and achieve lower prices, we focus particularly on implementing an efficient sourcing and food management policy through optimization of the procurement process and product development at both the recipe level and overall product offer level. We have developed relationships with a number of high-quality suppliers to source the ingredients we need. We use a limited number of suppliers for each ingredient to obtain high volume discounts and maximize the service level the business receives (backed up by contingency solutions) and only use a small number of suppliers in order to control and guarantee quality. We also optimize food costs by reducing waste and by focusing on food losses (for example, through our “Have it Your Way” model and “made to order” model, through which customers can customize their menu items and food is prepared only after a customer places an order, providing customers with fresh foods and limiting waste). We have implemented a purchasing strategy for raw materials which allows us to obtain price commitments from suppliers by giving them mid- to long-term visibility on volumes and growth in France. Moreover, we have entered into forward buying contracts with our suppliers, except for beef, which limit our exposure to any short-term fluctuations in food prices. A typical forward buying contract provides for fixed prices for at least six months. In addition, we entered into mid- to long-term contracts with our strategic suppliers for beef, French fries, buns, chicken and beverages. This strategy allows us to have pricing visibility and minimize the impact of fluctuations in food and supply prices on our operations for the duration of these contracts. Beef is a key ingredient in our product offerings. We have developed a dedicated strategy for beef supply management optimization in order to mitigate the effect of the global upward pricing trend on the beef market. In addition, we have a limited number of beef suppliers which are strictly required to purchase beef only from EU approved establishments and a limited number of countries of origin (France, Germany and Austria). In 2022, our beef is exclusively sourced from Europe, more than 50% of which comes from France. We intend to continue to select our suppliers and track our raw material sourcing using very strict processes, which include supplier selection criteria based on quality control, financial situation, production capacity (ability to handle both large volumes and flexible production), emergency back-up capabilities, as well as strength in research and development. _Supply Chain Logistics_ In addition, we aim to seek synergies and efficiencies in our logistics activity which supports delivery from our key suppliers. Our logistics of key products for most of our brands are managed through third parties, predominantly Transgourmet and Sysco, which are the main channels of supply for our operations. Where we can, we aim to centralize our product supply and logistics platform to streamline operational efficiency and provide uniform consistent high-quality products across all of our brands, ensuring that our franchisees have access to the necessary products to meet daily operational needs. For the Burger King brand, procurement and logistics activities are outsourced and handled by QSL-STEF, a joint venture of Quick Service Logistics (QSL) and STEF dedicated to the QSR sector. QSL-STEF purchases our food supplies and other raw materials from various suppliers. We contractually set certain targets and goals with QSLSTEF, which monitors our inventories and packaging in addition to ensuring that goods and materials reach our restaurants from their point of origin at an optimal cost and service level. Franchisees order their raw materials and supplies directly from QSL-STEF as an approved vendor. 179 ----- QSL-STEF serves as a third-party and fourth-party logistics provider for us, coordinating the logistics of our thirdparty providers and is also responsible for the warehousing and related storage from the suppliers. Under the terms of agreements with the suppliers, QSL-STEF becomes the owner of these products once they reach third party warehouses with whom it has contracted to provide such warehousing services. Storage and distribution of food items and operational supplies to all restaurants (Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants) is subcontracted to a third-party logistics provider (STEF). As we rely on QSL-STEF for coordinating logistics for our Burger King restaurants, we are able to negotiate favorable terms as a block and provide our Franchise Restaurants with the ability to achieve preferential price points, improving their overall results of operations. Our team in our headquarters located at Clichy, France monitors the logistics and distribution to our Burger King Company Restaurants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We are focused on innovation in terms of digital convenience options for our customers by integrating in-store experiences with digital platforms ensures that our franchisees are equipped to meet the evolving needs of consumers. We embrace technology to facilitate seamless interactions across various channels, from online ordering for Click & Collect meals and mobile apps to delivery services and in-person dining. We understand that developing additional channels for our customers provide complementary source of revenues to our in-person dining. As a result, we have reinforced our partnerships with food delivery platforms such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo, while developing new packaging for our brands, designed specifically for delivery. Each new franchisee that joins our network is required under their franchise agreement to offer home delivery as an option. We also offer our franchisees support in developing their mobile apps through our shared app structure that we then customize for each brand. Our restaurants also benefit from in-house business intelligence and customer data collection across our network, to provide consistent and reliable data that can be used to further improve performance. Our strategy is focused on going even further to leverage our existing network and capabilities by developing white label product offerings to capture additional revenue opportunities. Following the positive growth of these initiatives with the Burger King brand, we plan to replicate this model across our entire brand portfolio. Additionally, we have recently acquired The Original Food Court, a proprietary technology that enables customers to order seamlessly from all of our brands, creating a “digital food court.” Our commitment to innovation in the omni-channel space positions our brands as industry leaders, providing convenience and accessibility to customers while promoting growth and profitability for our franchise partners.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We offer our franchisees a comprehensive training program, with extensive materials and training on how to organize, manage and monitor service delivery in their restaurants, including best practices. Our detailed manuals assist franchisees in organizing the taking and dispatch of orders, for in restaurant dining, take away and drive through, and work force scheduling management during peak hours. In addition, for our Burger King brand, franchisees (along with their manager(s)) must attend and successfully complete a training program prior to opening their restaurant. Our training program covers various topics, including: culture, food preparation and storage, food safety, specific position training, uniforms, cleaning and sanitation, marketing and advertising, point of sale systems, accounting and hospitality, among others. We require our franchisees to live within one hour of their respective restaurant(s) and require them to hire a restaurant manager who either resides in the area where the restaurant is located or is willing to move to this area. We maintain programs to monitor and evaluate the adherence of Franchise Restaurants to our quality, service and cleanliness standards. We also closely monitor financial data of each Franchise Restaurant, including revenue, sales and profits. In addition, we are responsible for communicating and conveying certain initiatives and process enhancements to our franchisees and conducting business reviews in order to assist franchisees to operate more efficiently, increase financial performance, sales and profits and stimulate footfall and visibility. We have a dedicated franchise support team for each brand with proven expertise to assist in any challenges. Our franchisees 180 ----- also benefit from access to financial support from our French bank partners due to our scale, track-record and relationships, helping them to secure the capital they need to launch and grow their businesses effectively. Our support system is designed to foster a collaborative environment.

Our processes for site sourcing, development and construction prioritize a systematic approach for fast and efficient decision making in order to rapidly replicate success on a large-scale across our various brands.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,Restaurant Development,18.21.2,Site selection,"We consider the location of a restaurant to be critical to its long-term success and as such we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential locations for both Franchise Restaurants and Company Restaurants. In particular, while we are not responsible for the development of restaurants under our Pure Franchise arrangements, we assist our franchisees with site selection and connect them with trusted real estate partners to ensure they successfully open restaurants in optimal locations. We have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process that incorporates our management’s experience, as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our restaurant development team has extensive experience identifying and evaluating suitable restaurant locations with deep local knowledge, backed by a proprietary sourcing methodology that we apply across all of our restaurant brands. We also benefit from access to attractive prime locations as tenant of choice due to our scale and existing relationships. Our site selection process for both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants includes extensive data collection, strategic mapping and competitive analysis. We seek new restaurant locations based on specific criteria, such as intrinsic demographic characteristics and expected demographic trends relating to a potential location, the presence of one or several of our major competitors or indirect competitors, the catchment area, the known success of other retail brands already present in the area, the residential density thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. Each of these identification criteria is supported by our developed know-how. Following this initial “experience-based” assessment, our development and management teams assess the development costs of each site based on various factors, including the site’s complexity, size and location. The management team develops an estimate of the potential revenue for each identified site based on known local market trends and conditions and relies on estimated data such as the success rates of our major direct or indirect competitors in the vicinity. This enables our development and management teams, who meet on a weekly basis, to assess the potential return on investment and cash conversion rates of a restaurant at each new site identified. Thereafter management makes a physical visit to a potential site before a final decision is made to adapt a specific site. Our management teams are actively involved in the site selection process. Further work may be carried out on a potential site, including the appointment of marketing and footfall consultants to assess customer flow and market factors. Our development and management teams continue to compile and review information on a potential site up to the date a lease is signed. If any negative information on the proposed site or area is discovered during this time, the management team may choose not to proceed with 181 ----- developing a particular site. On average, the period from site selection to the start of construction is approximately 18 months.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,Restaurant Development,18.21.3,Construction,"On average, 24 months is required from the identification of a site until a restaurant is ready to open for business. The majority of this time is dedicated to carrying out due diligence regarding the potential site as described above and the negotiation and signing of a lease. This time period includes the average time required to obtain the necessary permits and carry out pre-opening training at the new location. A significant portion of this process, however, is related to obtaining the necessary construction permits when we are planning to build a new restaurant. In our experience, obtaining a construction permit from local authorities may take up to five months. While we are able to expedite this process under certain circumstances, the preliminary approval process imposes a significant delay and must be completed before we are able to begin other aspects of opening a new restaurant. However, the actual timeframe for the development of a new restaurant will vary based on site specific considerations such as whether the location is newly constructed or converted from an existing space. Management directly oversees each step of the development process. Where we identify a restaurant location that requires significant site construction, we may engage with Foncière Bertrand, a Group affiliate, to execute the required restaurant construction activities. See “Principal Shareholders _and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions.” This is the case primarily for restaurants that we_ open under our Burger King brand. In a standard process, where we identify a restaurant location that we believe is suitable but requires significant construction, we partner with Foncière Bertrand to secure the land through purchase and deliver a turnkey project for new restaurant openings. Once completed, Foncière Bertrand sells the land to one of our diversified bases of real estate investors who then lease the land back to us so that we can either sub-lease the restaurant to our franchisees under our Franchise with Lease Management arrangements or directly lease the restaurant to be operated as a Company Restaurant. This model permits us to build on our asset-light strategy, as we do not bear any of the capital expenditure requirements of constructing new restaurants, except limited expenditures necessary to complete technical fittings and leasehold improvements. In a Pure Franchise arrangement, our franchisees are solely responsible for all costs associated with opening a new restaurant. We regularly engage with potential lenders, educating them about the case for lending to our franchisees in France. Our consistently strong performance following the opening of a new restaurant helps provide comfort to potential lenders and allows our franchisees easier access to the necessary up-front costs of opening a new restaurant.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

We receive regular financial reporting by franchisees which assists us in monitoring performance and forecasting new development in similar locations. In addition, according to our franchise agreements, we have the right to review the financial information of our Franchise Restaurants upon request. We have implemented reporting procedures and IT systems that enable us to monitor the sales, labor and food costs for each of our restaurants on a daily basis. See “—Information Systems”.

In particular, in the case of Burger King, we are required to adhere to BKC’s standards and procedures on quality assurance and food safety and have benefitted from BKC’s strong experience and knowledge in this area. We have developed a strong hygiene culture and established a reliable control track record, with stringent standards which can in some cases go beyond the requirements under French legal regulations. Such standards apply to all the restaurants in our portfolio. See “Regulation” for a description of the laws and regulations that 182 ----- govern food safety and hygiene in our operations. No material food contamination incident has been attributed to our restaurants since we began operating the restaurant brands. Our quality control department is fully dedicated to monitoring and enforcing quality assurance and food safety standards and procedures and managing any quality or food safety issue across our entire supply chain from production to transportation and storage to end-delivery. We have implemented a detailed food safety manual that covers all aspects of cleaning, food handling and storage, pest control, stock control and waste disposal. We also have rigorous food safety procedures based on a hazard analysis and critical control points plan, which includes controls and monitoring for key processes such as receiving food deliveries, defrosting, cooking, cooling and storage. This includes stringent guidelines on date labelling, allergen labelling, refrigerator plans and temperature checks. In addition, we use specific cleaning products to maintain hygiene and food safety and we communicate an allergen list through leaflets, posters in restaurants and on our website. For Franchise Restaurants, non-compliance with our quality assurance and food safety rules is grounds for termination under our franchise agreements. For our Company Restaurants, any breach of our quality assurance and food safety rules by a restaurant is sanctioned and is factored into the restaurant manager’s compensation. We review our safety governance policy on an ongoing basis at the restaurant, area and group level. All restaurant employees receive training on critical aspects of food safety as part of their hiring process and also complete a food safety course. Restaurant team members receive ongoing training regarding sanitary procedures, and all senior personnel and managers are required to complete food safety qualifications administered by us. Senior operations management may also seek to attain further food safety qualifications. We inspect our restaurants on a quarterly basis, performing audits on the procedures in place to ensure that food is being correctly handled. In addition, we have a contract with an independent lab to perform bacteriological tests in certain of our restaurants. In the case of Burger King, BKC also conducts inspections on a quarterly basis in order to verify that its requirements are being respected. Further, failure to comply with food safety requirements may be grounds for termination of the Master Franchise Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The following provides a brief description of these arrangements. Commercial leases have a minimum initial duration of nine years to twelve years. For standard commercial leases, the lessee has the right to terminate a commercial lease at the end of each three-year period. For certain lease agreements, notably when we do not bear any of the capital expenditure requirements of construction (including technical fittings and leasehold improvements), we are able to negotiate longer lease terms. The lessor may only terminate the lease at the conclusion of each three-year period in certain limited circumstances. At the end of the contractual term of the lease, the lessee is entitled to a renewal. If the lessor refuses such renewal, the lessor will be required to compensate the lessee, unless the lessor can show good cause. Upon expiration of the lease agreement, if the lessor and lessee take no action to renew or to terminate the lease, the original lease will be automatically renewed until either the lessor or the lessee serves a notice of termination. An automatically renewed lease may be terminated at any time by either the lessor or the lessee _provided that six months’ prior notice is given. In addition to our commercial leases, we maintain certain ground leases for some of our older properties which have a typical duration of 30 years. The parties to a commercial lease are free to determine the initial rent, generally according to the current market value of the property at the signing of the contract. The rent may be fixed, variable or composed of a fixed portion and a variable portion. Generally, the lease contains an annual rent indexation clause. The agreed index must have some connection with the activity carried out by one of the parties or to the purpose of the lease. The majority of our leases are based on the Commercial Rent Index (ILC) (indice des loyers commerciaux) published by l’Institut _national de la statistique et des études économiques (INSEE), the French public statistics institute._ We do not lease the real estate for the restaurants under our Pure Franchise arrangements, which are the responsibility of our franchisees under such arrangements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

As franchisees are independent business owners, they and their employees are not included in our full-time employee count. We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our major competitors. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. In France, a collective bargaining framework agreement is in place for certain food market sectors that sets, among other things, annual working times, employee holiday time and overtime pay and employee leaving conditions. In addition, there is a limited number of trade unions that are recognized as representatives and given the legal authority to appoint trade union delegates, and to negotiate additional company-specific collective bargaining agreements. Some of our employees are members of these trade unions. We place significant emphasis on staff training, which we believe is key to maintaining high standards of quality across our business. We provide comprehensive in-house training to all employees, across both our Company Restaurants and to Franchise Restaurant staff through a number of training initiatives to actively support and foster employee development and retention at Franchise Restaurants. Our training focuses on health and safety issues for restaurant-based employees, and we also provide food-hygiene training and food retail management to managers of both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. In addition, we regularly encourage our franchisees and their employees to visit our Company Restaurants in order to demonstrate new equipment, menu items, workflow practices and ensure that all franchisees and their employees are trained to a consistent standard.

We therefore source a wide range of ingredients locally from France. As of December 31, 2023, for Burger King France 67% of the food products we purchase for our main categories of raw materials (including buns, potatoes, beef and chicken) come from French agri-food companies. In our casual dining restaurants, 100% of the beef sourced for menu options such as beef tartare are sourced from France, while 70% of our vegetables are sourced from France. Across all of our operations, our beef and poultry are exclusively sourced from Europe. We seek to partner with suppliers that promote the environment and respect for animal welfare. We signed a Better Chicken Commitment pledge with non-profit Compassion in World Farming to improve the well-being of poultry raised in France. We further aim to minimize the footprint of our products with a focus on our ingredients and product offerings. We aim to design our menu options with an eye for seasonal ingredients to reduce the impact of non-seasonal options. Through our ingredients, we are committed to providing seasonal fruits, MSC-certified fish and organic ingredients. We believe driving the adoption of meatless proteins is one of the most impactful ways that we can contribute to the reduction in the carbon footprint of our industry. As a result, we started developing and marketing plant-based offerings to implement across our different brand menus. Providing our customers with healthy dining options is at the heart of our food innovation philosophy. We have focused on implementing policies to protect consumer health, including through improving the nutritional profile and ingredients of our products and developing product ranges for specific nutritional requirements. We are also committed to the reduction of palm oil, artificial preservatives, sugar, salt and other high-calorie ingredients that do not promote proportionate nutritional value. Moreover, we also continue to invest in customer choice, by proposing new products in order to satisfy most of our clients’ tastes such as low-calorie salads, wraps, vegan and vegetarians options. Since our products are developed in France, we are able to provide our customers access to nutritional information, as well as information on product allergens to allow customers to make an informed choice within our offer. 184 ----- Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to help ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products by conducting strict internal control over food safety across our network. We maintain strict controls over the food supply chain to guarantee product safety, regulatory compliance and to assure the quality standards of our restaurants. For these purposes, we have implemented supplier controls, production controls and a system of food safety verification, as well as pre-approving a limited number of key suppliers for our franchisees. For example, raw materials are controlled by an external laboratory to ensure proper compliance with all food safety criteria. We are also able to trace the distribution of raw materials from our production facilities or suppliers. We have implemented rigorous control protocols over all our restaurants, which are subject to bi-monthly hygiene audits performed by an external independent accredited laboratory.

In 2023, 44% of our employees were women. Since 2019, the Penicaud index, a gender equality index introduced under the French law no. 201915 of January 8, 2019, has applied to all companies in France with more than 50 employees. The index provides an optimal score of 100, calculated on the basis of five indicators, including, for example, the gender pay gap and differences in distribution of individual salary increases. In 2023, our operations achieved a Penicaud index score greater than 90 for entities of the Burger King perimeter, above the compliance threshold of 75. We aim to maintain this equality in the future and to prioritize gender equality in our management teams in our branch restaurants. We have also adopted a policy for harassment and bullying at work in our restaurants, as well as an incident reporting platform to address such occurrences. We recognize the importance of inclusion and consider the diversity of our team as one of our greatest strengths. Therefore, we focus on growing employment for individuals with disabilities to promote inclusion. Training is the cornerstone of our operational excellence. We provide continuous investment in our training teams. For example, for our Burger King brand, we require a minimum of 50 hours of training per employee, nine weeks for managers and 18 weeks for directors to offer career growth, retain talent and maintain high service quality.

Our environmental initiatives are built on three key pillars: the reduction of the impact of (i) our real estate footprint, (ii) our waste and (iii) our logistics. To mitigate our real estate footprint we have used PEFC-certified wooden frames for all new buildings since 2019. Furthermore, we participate in trial initiatives, for example, rooftop energy collection, CO2 cooling, optimized lighting and car charging points. We are committed to reducing waste and implementing eco-friendly packaging. To this end, we have banned our usage of single-use plastic from our service packaging in favor of paper solutions. Our environmentally-friendly packaging has helped us avoid approximately 1.9 tons per year of single-use plastic waste used in our Burger King brand restaurants. For example, for our Burger King brand, our kids cups have been plastic-free and compostable since 2021. In addition, since 2020, toys are no longer systematically distributed with kids menus, leading to 10% of such menus being sold without any toys. In addition, we have a plan in place to significantly reduce waste. For example, we have introduced packaging systems that do not require a lid and we have also reduced the size of our cashier’s receipts. Furthermore, we have implemented waste sorting and collection initiatives. Moreover, we are committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the fight against climate change. For example, for our Burger King brand, in 2019 we optimized our truck load by improving the filling rate of our trucks for a 15% reduction in route mileage. This allows our truck fleet to meet a strict criterion in terms of polluting gas emissions (in line with the Euro 6 European emissions standards).

The Franchise Law provides certain protections to franchisees in the context of the entering into of a franchise agreement. Franchisors are subject to regulations preventing undue interference with franchisees’ business operations, as well as requiring that franchisors provide certain information to franchisees and potential franchisees. For example, franchisors are required to provide potential franchisees, or current franchisees contemplating the opening of a new store, with certain information at least 20 days prior to entering into a franchise agreement. The franchisor must provide full and accurate information regarding the franchise to allow the prospective franchisee to make an informed decision with respect to the franchise.

It is an increasingly regulated tool that is intended to help customers in their food choices and to support public health policy measures. Our products are subject to Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of October 25, 2011 on the provision of information to customers (the “Food Labelling Regulation”), which replaced and consolidated into one piece of legislation previous labelling rules deriving from Directive 2000/13/EC regarding labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling of foodstuffs, and other legislative acts for specific categories of foods. The Food Labelling Regulation, which introduced key changes such as mandatory nutrition disclosure on processed foods and amendments to nutrition labelling format, entered into force on December 13, 2014 (save for the obligation to provide nutrition information applicable from December 13, 2016). Successive amendments to the Food Labelling Regulations, including various EU and French implementation regulations, have since been adopted on various subjects, including the indication of the country of origin for certain types of meat and other ingredients, nutritional and health claims made with respect to food products and the labeling of additional vitamins, minerals and other substances in food ingredients. For example, Regulation (EU) 2018/775 lays down rules for the application of Article 26(3) of the Food Labelling Regulation. It sets out guidelines for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food product, providing that if the origin or provenance of a product’s primary ingredient is different to the origin or provenance currently indicated on the label of a food, food services providers will have to provide additional information on packaging regarding the origin of the primary ingredient or ingredients. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure that customers are not misled about the origin of a product’s ingredients. In recent years, national and local authorities have begun reinforcing such food labelling regulations and requirements motivated by concerns regarding nutrition and environmental sustainability. These measures have included, among others, greater emphasis on food labelling and disclosure of nutritional content, requirements to utilize recyclable packaging materials, and additional taxes on food and beverage items with high sugar content. For example, specific French legislation regulates the labelling of beef in restaurant establishments (Decree no. 2002-1465 of December 17, 2002). In addition, there has been increasing regulatory scrutiny over the disclosure of allergens present in prepared food products. For example, French legislation (Decree No. 2015-447 of April 17, 2015) regulates consumer information on allergens. Pursuant to such regulation, allergenic substances present in both prepackaged and non-prepackaged products must be pointed out in the list of ingredients. In the coming years, we expect additional regulations pertaining to food labelling to be enacted. For example, the European Commission is contemplating the introduction of uniform mandatory nutrition labelling laws for the front of food packaging, in addition to the mandatory labelling already imposed on the back of food packaging. The proposed labelling could take a form analogous to the Nutri-Score used today in France. Under the current timetable for the European Commission’s “Green Deal”, regulations are expected to set maximum levels of certain nutrients in food products and to establish uniform nutritional profiles, as well as to limit certain communication around products rich in sugar, salt and fat.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Food safety and hygiene regulations and directives promulgated by the EU have an impact on our business because we conduct substantially all of our activities in France, which is a member state of the EU. The main food safety regulator at the EU level is the European Food Safety Authority (the “EFSA”), which was established in 2002 by Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, as amended and supplemented (the “General Food Law Regulation”), which is the key text of the Hygiene Package. The EFSA assesses and communicates risks associated with the food chain in order to inform the policies and decisions of food safety risk managers. The General Food Law Regulation lays down the general principles and requirements of food safety legislation to be implemented into national law by all member states of the EU. In particular, the General Food Law Regulation requires food business operators to ensure that businesses under their control satisfy relevant requirements and to verify that such requirements are met at all stages of production, processing and distribution. It also imposes a mandatory traceability requirement along the entire food chain that applies to all food and all types of operators in the processing, transportation, storage, distribution and retail stages, among others. Each food operator is required to register and keep for a reasonable period of time (the guidance of the Standing Committee states that five years is a reasonable time) detailed product information (including the name and address of the producer, the nature of the product and the transaction date) and make such records immediately available to competent authorities upon request. As part of the Hygiene Package, we are also subject to other specific European food hygiene legislation under Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 of April 29, 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, which applies to all food businesses, and defines general hygiene rules applicable to all foodstuffs, and to Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 of April 29, 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for the hygiene of foodstuffs of animal origin (together, the “EU Hygiene Regulations”). The EU Hygiene Regulations require that we obtain and maintain hazard analysis and critical control point (“HACCP”) certification, including instructing employees in this regard and conducting appropriate record-keeping. HACCP is a systematic preventive approach used in the food industry to identify potential food safety hazards, so that key actions (known as critical control points) may be taken to reduce or eliminate risks, while considering all key aspects of product manufacturing, from the safety of the raw materials, to process validation (for example, cooking and washing), to shelf life and finally end-consumer usage. In addition, the EU Hygiene Regulations include more stringent requirements for food products of animal origin, such as meat, fish and dairy products, and food containing such products. European legislation regulates the temperature settings at which these products must be kept as well as the length of time for which they can be displayed. A number of subsequent regulations that serve as implementing texts of the Hygiene Package have also been enacted, certain of which are applicable in our operations. These regulations lay out specific criteria and requirements for compliance with the Hygiene Package, as well as consequences for non-compliance. _France_ In France, the principal food safety regulator is the Agency for Food, Environment and Occupational Health and Safety (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail, or the “ANSES”). The ANSES provides the relevant authorities with the necessary expertise in order to set national-level regulations concerning, among other subjects: hygiene rules applicable to the retailing, storage and transport of products of animal origin and food containing such products; technical and hygiene conditions applicable to the transport of foodstuffs; and licensing of establishments that bring to market products of animal origin or food containing such products. In addition, French food safety regulation requires each establishment that brings to market products of animal origin or food containing such products to obtain an official authorization. Further, we 188 ----- are subject to several provisions of the French Rural and Maritime Fishing Code (Code rural et de la pêche _maritime), as amended, dealing, among others, with food safety epidemiology concerns related to products of_ animal origin and animal feed, and animal health.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The Single-Use Plastics Directive promotes approaches that favor sustainable and non-toxic re-,58.4.1,,"usable products and re-use systems instead of single-use products. Furthermore, the European Commission has published guidance on single-use plastics products to ensure uniformity in implementing the Single-Use Plastics Directive across the European Union. In France, the AGEC law aims to end the use of single-use plastic packaging by 2040. Plastic cups and plates were banned beginning on January 1, 2020. Plastic straws, confetti, cutlery and polystyrene take-away boxes were banned beginning on January 1, 2021. In addition, from January 1, 2023, fast-food restaurants are obliged to use reusable tableware for the meals and drinks consumed on site by their customers. The AGEC extended the EPR sector to cover toys in France. Plastic toys are often offered in the catering sector with some of their menus. However, the plastic toys are not recyclable and often end up in the waste bin. Therefore, from January 1, 2022, the law provides for the prohibition of plastic toys supplied with some kids menus. As a result, plastic toys are made optional in kids menus. _Selective sorting regulation_ In addition, in France, Decree no. 2016-288 of March 10, 2016, governs waste management in the workplace. This requires selective sorting according to the five streams identified in the regulation. The five streams include types of recyclable waste (paper, metal, plastic, glass and wood) that must be sorted by all companies that generate and hold such waste in France. In particular, the fast-food sector is subject to the regulation of all five streams. 190 ----- This requires the fast-food establishment to sort the waste according to its nature. To this end, establishments will have to equip their French sites with selective sorting stations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The GDPR sets out the general framework for the European data privacy regime. Under the GDPR, the definition of personal data includes information such as name, identification number, e-mail address, location data, online identifiers such as Internet protocol addresses and cookie identifiers, or any other type of information that can identify a natural person. The GDPR sets out, among others, the following key principles and obligations that apply to the Group and its operations: - Lawfulness: any use/processing of personal data requires a specific legal basis. Use of personal data is permissible, for example: to the extent this is required to perform a contract; if the individual has given its consent; or if the organization has a legitimate interest. - Fairness and proportionality: processing of personal data must be fair, proportionate and compatible with the purpose for which the data were collected. - Transparency: individuals must be informed about the processing of their personal data. - Security: adequate technical and organizational measures need to be implemented to ensure the security of personal data. - Storage limitation: personal data may not be retained for longer than necessary and should be deleted after such period. - Data subject rights: individuals have several rights under the GDPR such as a: - right to access (obtain a copy of their personal data); - right to rectify any incorrect personal data; - right to request erasure of any personal data when no longer needed; - right to data portability (receive the personal data in a structured format so it can be used by another service provider); and - right to object to the use of personal data on in particular situations. 191 ----- - Use of third-party service providers: in the event the personal data is processed by a service provider (data processor) on behalf of a data controller, this processing needs to be governed by a contract between the data controller and the data processor. Such contract must include certain mandatory clauses, such as for example on the subject-matter and duration of the processing; the right to audit, not engaging other third-party providers without consent, etc. Personal data breaches: depending on the breach, the competent supervisory authority and/or the data subject may need to be informed of a personal data breach within 72 hours after becoming aware of such breach. - Record keeping: Controllers and processors are required to be able to demonstrate compliance with the rules imposed by the GDPR at all times and on an ongoing basis. To that end, organizations must maintain a record containing a description of all their data processing activities. - Data controllers and processors may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) in certain situations. - The transfer of personal data to entities outside the EEA is subject to specific requirements. Fines for breach of the GDPR may be significant, depending on circumstances of an individual breach. In the worst-case scenario, they can go as high as 20 million euros or 4% of our total annual revenue.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes. “Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except (x) in respect of the first Interest Period, for which the Determination Date will be the Issue Date and (y) in the event that EURIBOR is not available for any Interest Period (or portion thereof) as may be required to calculate the interest payable in order to redeem any or all Floating Rate Notes in respect of any notice of redemption delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to use the Determination Date for the prior Interest Period (as notified by the Issuer to the Trustee, Paying Agent, Calculation Agent and the holders of the Floating Rate Notes in such redemption notice); provided that if the redemption date is delayed requiring the Issuer to update the notice of redemption, the Issuer will also reset the Determination Date in accordance with this definition. “EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0.00%. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request (or cause to be requested) that the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the eurozone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the 219 ----- euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request (or cause to be requested) that each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, or it becomes illegal for the Calculation Agent to determine any amounts due to be paid, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with the Rate Determination Agent, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes; provided further that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the holders of Floating Rate Notes, the Calculation Agent, the Paying Agent and the Trustee of the adoption of any such alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis (provided that the EURIBOR successor rate does not, without the prior agreement of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, have the effect of increasing the obligations or duties, or decreasing the rights or protections, of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as the case may be, under the Indenture). The decision of the Issuer will be binding on the Issuer, the Calculation Agent and the holders of Floating Rate Notes, without any further action or consent by the holders of Floating Rate Notes or the Trustee, and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least ten Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such EURIBOR successor rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the applicable rate. “Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that have adopted the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude     , 2024. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer and which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be any of the Agents) as appointed by the Issuer at the expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under (a), the Issuer. “Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System, or any successor system, is open for the settlement of payments in euro. 220 ----- The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. Brussels time on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each outstanding Floating Rate Note, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes is permitted by any applicable law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made or intended to be made by the Calculation Agent.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably requested by the Trustee or the Paying Agent, the Issuer or the Guarantors will provide to the Trustee or the Paying Agent such information as may be in the possession of the Issuer or the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee or the Paying Agent) to enable the Trustee or the Paying Agent to determine the amount of withholding Taxes attributable to any particular holder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Issuer or the Guarantors be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential.

The Notes will be guaranteed within 60 days of the Issue Date by the Guarantors. The Parent will not guarantee the Notes. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. As described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the New Revolving Credit Facility or other indebtedness of the Issuer shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees or security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles which limit the ability of the Issuer, a Guarantor or the Parent Security Provider to provide a guarantee or security, as applicable, or may require that the guarantee or security interest granted be limited by an amount or otherwise, as described below under “—Security—General”. Each of the Note Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be contractually limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or any security interest granted by such Guarantor, as applicable, could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes. Other debt of such Guarantor may not be similarly limited. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Applicable _laws may limit amounts recoverable under the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral”._ The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Parent will not guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The _Issuers and certain Guarantors are holding companies dependent upon cash flows from the operating companies of the Group to meet their obligations on the Notes or the Guarantees”._",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Within 60 days from the Issue Date, the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Note Guarantees will be secured by the Post-Closing Date Collateral (as defined below) on a senior basis. As of the Issue Date, the Issue Date Collateral is expected to include the following properties and assets of the Issuer and the Parent Security Provider: - the financial securities accounts (compte-titres) to which the shares of the Issuer owned by the Parent Security Provider representing 100% of the issued share capital of the Issuer, are credited; - the respective financial securities accounts (compte-titres) to which the shares owned by the Issuer in each of its direct subsidiaries Groupe Flo SAS, MiditsuCo GB SAS, Holdco GB SAS, United Lab SAS, Bertrand Franchise Services SAS and Midco GB are credited, in each case constituting all of the outstanding shares of each such subsidiary owned by the Issuer; - all intragroup loan receivables owed to the Issuer; - the material bank accounts of the Issuer located in France; and - all receivables due to the Issuer by BH pursuant to the BH Cash Management Agreement, together, the “Issue Date Collateral”. In addition, BH will grant for the benefit of the Issuer only a bank account pledge over the dedicated account on which all funds advanced to BH by the Issuer pursuant to the BH Cash Management Agreement (and all proceeds thereof) will be credited from time to time. Within 60 days from the Issue Date, the Post-Closing Date Collateral is expected to include the following properties and assets of the Post-Closing Guarantors: - the financial securities account (compte-titres) to which the shares owned by Midco GB in Burger King France SAS are credited; - the financial securities account (compte-titres) to which the shares owned by Burger King France SAS over Burger King Restauration, Financière BKF, Burger King Construction and France BKR are credited; - the financial securities account (compte-titres) to which the shares owned by Financière BKF in France BKR SAS are credited; - the financial securities account (compte-titres) to which the shares owned by Groupe Flo SAS over ABDF (ex. B&C Développement Franchise), Léon Invest 1, Léon Invest 2, SDC Léon, LDF (ex. Léon de Bruxelles) and VDF are credited; - the shares (parts sociales) owned by Groupe Flo in Hippo Exploitation (ex. Hippo Gestion & Cie); - the shares (parts sociales) owned by Financière BKF in BK Invest France; 230 ----- - the shares (parts sociales) owned by France BKR SAS in BK Invest France; - the material bank accounts of each Post-Closing Guarantor located in France; and - all intragroup loan receivables owed to each Post-Closing Guarantor, together, the “Post-Closing Date Collateral”. The assets and property of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Parent Security Provider that are from time to time subject to, or required to be subject to, a Lien pursuant to the Security Documents are referred to as the “Collateral”. The security and other agreements in respect of the Collateral are referred to as the “Security Documents”. The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or other restrictions applicable to security providers, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers. The Liens securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations on a pari passu basis. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations will be entitled to receive payment from the proceeds of enforcement of the Security Documents prior to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. In addition, under the Indenture, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to Incur certain additional Debt in the future that may share in the Collateral, including Debt with priority rights to proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. The amount of such additional Debt will be limited by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Debt”. Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Debt that may share in the_ Collateral could be significant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including: - if the cost of providing security or perfecting the same is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders of Notes and the other secured parties; - if providing such security requires consent of a third party and such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors; - if providing such security would be prohibited or to the extent it would be limited by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles or if entering into the Security Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors or officers, contravene any legal prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors or officers; and - until an enforcement action is taken, if perfecting such security would have an unreasonable adverse effect on the ability of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as permitted by the Indenture. Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Parent Security Provider to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’, as applicable, payment obligations 231 ----- under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, _inter _alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the lenders under the New_ Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain secured hedge counterparties, and for the Trustee and the holders of Notes. Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests in France, the relevant Security Documents will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Debt under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the other secured obligations). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in France. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral”. Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable, the Security Documents, and the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such. The holders of the Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent (as creditor of the parallel debt, in respect of the Security Documents governed by French law), as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents (the “Security Interests”) that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents in accordance with the Indenture and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement of Transaction Security”._ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Parent Security Provider, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing). The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, respectively, and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The proceeds from the _enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”._ No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantors in connection with this Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Notes or the Note Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all. The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France. The term “Security Interests” refers to the Liens on the Collateral. 232 ----- Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall procure that each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any, and the Parent Security Provider shall, at their own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent or the Trustee, as applicable, may require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Parent Security Provider shall, and shall procure that each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may request.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of such series of the Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)) to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, is required to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and that it is entitled to redeem such Notes pursuant to their terms. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of independent tax counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.14,Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control,21.14.1,,"If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs at any time, then the Issuer must make an offer (a “Change of _Control Offer”) to each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or in integral multiples of_ €1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder’s Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that are prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the Indenture. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes in accordance with the Indenture and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the notice will state: (a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice; (b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute a Change of Control; (c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, 237 ----- or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations; (d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; (e) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and (f) any other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. An agent of the Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for such Notes. The Trustee (or the authenticating agent appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note or Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated Notes; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The Issuer’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer of such repurchase. If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. If the Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default”. Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the Issuer and its subsidiaries may prohibit the prepayment of the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. The New Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant restricting the Issuer from offering to purchase the Notes, unless the Issuer has complied with its mandatory prepayment obligations in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility as a result of such Change of Control. If the Issuer was so prohibited from conducting a Change of Control Offer and not able to prepay any indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations to holders of the Notes who exercise their right to have their Notes repurchased following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture. A Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived by holders of the Notes, could result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements”._ The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers of the Notes. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the 238 ----- future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Debt are contained in the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation _on Debt” and “—Limitation on Liens”. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a_ majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “— _Amendments and Waivers”). Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the provisions of_ the Indenture will not require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) the Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any “person” or “group” of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders, being or becoming the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer (or any successor entity permitted by the covenant described under the caption “— _Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”); provided that, for the purposes_ of this clause, no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of the Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent; (b) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person, other than or one or more Permitted Holders; or (c) the Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or dissolution other than in a transaction that complies with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain _Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.”_ 239 ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes if made prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph. No Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. While the Notes are held in certificated form, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes redeemed. For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the _Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations, posted on the_ official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

(6) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Debt of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Debt is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Restricted Subsidiary shall be in Default of this covenant). (7) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (2)(a) through (r) of this covenant or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify items of Debt on the date of its Incurrence and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Debt in one of such clauses or paragraphs, and the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant, and may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type of Debt described in this “—Limitation on _Debt” covenant at any time; provided that all Debt Incurred under any Credit Facility that is_ secured by Liens on the Collateral that are accorded super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to have been Incurred in reliance on the exception 246 ----- provided in clause (2)(a) above and may not be reclassified. Subject to the limitations in this paragraph, if an item of Debt (or a portion thereof) is Incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such item of Debt (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission. (8) Debt permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Debt but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more provisions of this covenant permitting such Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee or any of the Agents is responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), this discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) who purchases the Notes for cash at original issue and at their issue price (generally, with respect to any series of Notes, the first price at which a substantial amount of such series of Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) and who holds the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, and holders of indebtedness of the Group that is repaid pursuant to the Refinancing. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

The Issuer intends to take the position that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. Assuming the Issuer’s position is respected, any such additional payments would generally be taken into account by a U.S. holder at the time such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s usual method of accounting for tax purposes. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such U.S. holder will recognize income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. 316 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

In the event that the Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of such Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of such Notes may be required to include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such series of Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined _de minimis_ amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Floating Rate Notes or the Fixed Rate Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder of such Notes is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to such Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note issued with OID at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only with respect to the Floating Rate Notes, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Notes as of the issue date. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Stated Interest.” A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is considered to be traded on an 317 ----- established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (and, if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method U.S. holder makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S. holder, increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Stated Interest”. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (and if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates generally will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Stated Interest,” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. In the case of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals), any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of a restructuring. In order to transpose the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, the French government issued: (i) on September 15, 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as from October 1[st], 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and (ii) on September 23, 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the implementation of the 2021 Ordinance.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.1,"Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015 and applies",910.1.2,,"to insolvencies which commenced after 26 June 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have considered a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts most of its business or has its head office and the location where most of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be 323 ----- recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”. When main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. When main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: (i) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; (ii) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; (iii) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and (iv) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no 324 ----- preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a debtor and its creditors, the court, at the request of the debtor or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. When the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: (i) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (A) courts and (B) insolvency practitioners and courts; (ii) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; (iii) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and (iv) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on 31 December 2020, in accordance with EUWA (as amended by the _European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) converts directly applicable EU law (which includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the Transition Period into UK domestic law subject to a number of amendments. The _Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) set out a number of amendments to be made to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK and domestic UK insolvency law including the Insolvency Regulation. As the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement regime for the automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will 325 ----- be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular, in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

In addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France or it has an establishment in France or, (ii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office or its main center of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, it could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., either safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde and _sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement _judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation _judiciaire)._ Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our Group having its COMI in France could be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation also lists accelerated financial safeguard proceedings as insolvency proceedings but accelerated financial safeguard proceedings no longer have a separate existence under French law as they have been merged into accelerated safeguard proceedings as of October 1[st], 2021 (save for proceedings commenced before this date) by the 2021 Ordinance. Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or court-administered proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in net turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts. In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds). Accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes or the Note Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations that are due and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending 327 ----- enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see section “Hardening Period” below).",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.4,Court-Assisted Proceedings,"A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. _Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of_ the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the _mandataire ad hoc are determined by the president of the competent court that appoints him or her, usually to_ facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. _Mandat ad hoc_ proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually also accept to abstain from such action while they are ongoing. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of_ a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the president of the competent court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this fivemonth period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. 328 ----- _Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from_ taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. Creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above) if a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, is suing for payment, or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim. In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the competent Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the competent Court at the request of the debtor - following a hearing held for that purpose to which the person appointed by the social and economic committee, as the case may be, must be convened – if: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the terms of the conciliation agreement ensure the continuation of the business as a goingconcern; and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgment (constatation) as described above and, in addition: (i) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the amount of any Conciliation Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the social and economic committee, that is informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court; (ii) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including with respect to certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “Conciliation Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; (iii) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted), not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed); 329 ----- (iv) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and (v) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of occurrence of the insolvency (see section “Insolvency test” above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below – see section “Hardening _Period” below), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval_ (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force: (i) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; (ii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and (iii) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor during the execution of the conciliation agreement pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code mentioned above. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the conciliation agreement addressing the consequences of such termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may also be revoked. Conversely, _provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by potential recoveries made) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor’s business, in particular through a “plan for the sale of the business” a.k.a. a prepack sale plan (plan de _cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial_ liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements, offers received in this context by the _mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may, after consultation of the public prosecutor, be considered by the court_ in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or_ (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. 330 ----- A statement of all the costs incurred by the debtor is prepared by him, with the conciliator’s help and includes: (i) the remuneration of the conciliator, if it has already been agreed, or, if not, the conditions of this remuneration as fixed by the president of the court, as well as the remuneration of the mandataire ad hoc if a mandat ad hoc has immediately preceded the commencement of the conciliation proceedings; (ii) the remuneration of any person or expert appointed by the judge or involvement of whom has been requested by the conciliator; (iii) the fees of the debtor’s advisors or those paid by the debtor in the framework of the conciliation proceedings and the mandat ad hoc proceedings which may have immediately preceded it; and (iv) the fees of the creditor’s advisors when they are charged to the debtor. This statement shall be signed and submitted to the court’s clerk by the debtor. Before acknowledging or approving the conciliation agreement, the president of the court or the court checks the filing of this statement with the court clerk. This cost statement may only be disclosed to the _conciliateur, the president of the court, the court or the State prosecutor. In the event of the opening of subsequent insolvency proceedings, the court may, ex officio or at the request of the State prosecutor, be provided with the statement. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. Although French accelerated safeguard proceedings are the transposition into French law of preventive restructuring proceedings in the spirit of the EU Restructuring Directive, they are defined in the French Commercial Code by reference to standard safeguard proceedings. As a result and for the sake of clarity, standard safeguard proceedings will be presented below before accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.5,Court-Administered Proceedings - Safeguard,"A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, _provided that it is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors (or submit to the classes of affected parties – see below) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the courtappointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator._ 331 ----- Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). The supervisory judge can appoint one to five controllers (contrôleurs) among the creditors who have filed a request, provided they meet certain conditions (in particular no affiliation to the debtor). Controllers assist the creditors’ representative in his functions and the supervisory judge in his duty of supervising the progress of the insolvency proceedings. In order to protect creditors’ interests and under certain conditions, the controllers may act in the interests of the creditors when the creditors’ representative fails to take sufficient action. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative_ or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if, no plan has been adopted, the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (i)(b) above where: (i) the court may not act upon its own initiative, and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the supervisory judge as controller (contrôleur) (if any), the public prosecutor and the person appointed by the social and economic committee(if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. _Judicial Restructuring Lien: Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard, judicial_ reorganization or liquidation proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial Restructuring Lien”): (i) during the observation period in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the temporary continuation of business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the supervisory judge and are subject to publicity, or (ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan, enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien (iv) pre-commencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code. 332 ----- The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to commencement of the proceedings. In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. Creditors (and if applicable, equity holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the_ proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the creditors representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, _provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the creditors representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-forequity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to exceptions such as the ones applicable to claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates falling after the term of the plan, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if such date is later than the first payment date provided for in the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. 333 ----- If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps. _Class-based consultation: This applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the_ proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties affectées), as defined below. Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan. Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code, affected parties are: (i) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan; (ii) equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are modified by the proposed plan. Please note that a decision of the Versailles Court of Appeals, 22 June 2023, no 23/03276 in the Orpea matter, ruled that holders of notes giving future access to the share capital (such as notes convertible into shares) are deemed to be creditors for the purposes of the proceedings if they have not converted their bonds into equity by the date of the commencement of the proceedings. The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes presenting a sufficient commonality of economic interest (communauté _d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions:_ (i) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of their claims so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes; 334 ----- (ii) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the courtappointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class; (iii) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and (iv) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme (AGS) claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account. At least 21 days prior to the date of the vote, the court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered certified accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust. Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors’ representative or the court-appointed administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the parties. The court of appeal then has 15 days to rule. There is no possibility to submit a challenge before the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation). The debtor, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of preparing the draft plan. The proposed plan may, _inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien). The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree. The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days. The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting a vote. If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority. Within a class, the vote on the adoption of the plan may be replaced by an agreement which, after consultation with its members, has received the approval of two-thirds of the voting rights. 335 ----- Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the competent court which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met: (i) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above; (ii) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated equally and in proportion to their claim or right; (iii) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties; (iv) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e., no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved); (v) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and (vi) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected. The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). Cross-class cram-down: The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a_ cross-class cram-down mechanism into French law: where the safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties that voted against the plan provided that: (i) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; (ii) the plan has been approved by: (a) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors class (créanciers _chirographaires); or, if such condition is not met,_ (b) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); 336 ----- (iii) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e., absolute priority rule); (iv) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its claims or interests; (v) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if: (a) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and 20 million euros of net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover; (b) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); (c) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, pro _rata their shareholding; and_ (d) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of equity holders, The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes. Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption. As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent. If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent. At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that - the best interest test criterion has not been met; or 337 ----- - in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met: (a) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the order of payment in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, a court-ordered sale plan); (b) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such class(es) would not have received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, of a court-ordered sale plan), may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor. In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed and, in judicial reorganization proceedings, in case of failure of the classbased consultation (see section “Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial _Liquidation Proceedings” below)). Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security_ and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called upon to vote on the proposed plan.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.6,Court-Administered Proceedings - Accelerated Safeguard,"A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) enabling it to implement a restructuring plan in an expedited fashion through a class-based consultation. To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: 338 ----- (i) its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable); (ii) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; (iii) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough of the parties that will be impaired to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period, that may be extended up to a total maximum of four months, following commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings, upon request from the debtor and the court-appointed administrator; and (iv) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings. The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors alone. If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditor classes (see above) to be formed, the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected parties, party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered-accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing (see section “Status of Creditors during Safeguard, _Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings” below)._",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.7,Court-Administered Proceedings - Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings,"Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be initiated against (by a creditor or the public prosecutor) or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of judicial liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above). De jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire), 339 ----- a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), the partial or total sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and the adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows: (i) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator on their own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); (ii) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; (iii) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void. (iv) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide to apply the cross-class cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in addition to the debtor or the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and (v) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails the approval of the plan may occur through the standard consultation rules (see above). In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization proceedings: (i) in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan 340 ----- provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan; (ii) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Commercial Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (b) the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: (a) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or (b) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession). At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: 341 ----- (i) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: (a) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; (b) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and (c) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their going-concern market value; or (ii) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (a) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only), the formal prior authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to proceed with the amicable auction sale (adjudication amiable); (b) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (c) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). 342 ----- However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court orders a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either: (i) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction _du passif); or_ (ii) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: (i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or (ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from_ these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.8,The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings,"The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings, unless, in this decision or in a subsequent one, the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of a professional receivables (Dailly assignment) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. 343 ----- Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers _détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court_ determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”. There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, _diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014,_ no. 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, except in accelerated safeguard proceedings and judicial liquidation proceedings where the continued operation of the business has not been ordered by the court, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and _provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above. In such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision ordering the sale plan, as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) required by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier requesting payment directly from the debtor; 344 ----- (iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge; (iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; (v) creditors (or beneficiaries of a third-party security granted by the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (a) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (b) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed to the creditor; or (c) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset - whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights _in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings that may be commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); and (vi) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code; and (vii) in the context of reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. 345 ----- A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan or of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the relevant official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et _Commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France._ Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the twoor four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or chartered certified accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two- or four-months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court orders a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, postcommencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and public creditors (i.e., taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority is not relevant to all creditors, for example creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset will be treated separately. 346 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.12,Limitations on Guarantees,"The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to: (a) certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and (b) French corporate benefit rules. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce _pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Notes Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantees. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.13,Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.,"Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted 347 ----- that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société _par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly_ established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.14,Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”),"Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. In addition, in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be noted that foreign investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors (notably where their activities relate to equipment, products or services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national security, in particular in the areas of energy and water supply, public health, public transport and electronic communication) may require the prior authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business. Where any of the above sectors are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure: (a) A transaction as a result of which a non-EU investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business (branche _d’activité) or (iii) crosses the threshold of 33.33 percent of the share capital, in each case of a company_ whose registered office is located in France. 348 ----- (b) A transaction as a result of which an EU investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business, in either case of a company whose registered office is located in France. (c) A transaction as a result of which a French investor under non-French control acquires all or part of a business of a company whose registered office is located in France. When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French authorities which must render a decision within two months of receipt of the application (failing which authorization shall be deemed to have been granted).",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or wilful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,910,EUROPEAN UNION,910.2,France,910.2.16,Parallel Debt - Trust,"The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be provided for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a 349 ----- security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_ n°10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged (i) in insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, by the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the commissioner of its safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or (ii) by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a Note Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Note Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Note Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for 350 ----- any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are qualified broker-dealers under applicable law. We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions”. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: - a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; - a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or - not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Important Information _About This Offering Memorandum” and “Notice to Investors”._ The Notes and the Guarantees are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer intends to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof; however, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the Issue Date, which will be     business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is referred to as “T +      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. 353 ----- In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their respective behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Managers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided, and may in the future provide, commercial lending, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuer, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees and expenses. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer’s affiliates. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum United JVCO holds 18.00% of the share capital of the Parent, and is itself held by a several investment vehicles which include Goldman Sachs Asset Management, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers will be mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will be made available to the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries on or about the Issue Date. Some of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates hold positions under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which is being refinanced in the context of the Refinancing, and will therefore receive a portion of the proceeds of the Notes. Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker-dealers registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The majority of the directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciare) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. The civil court with territorial jurisdiction is determined in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the French Code of Civil Procedure. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained, at the request of the party in whose favor the judgment was rendered, following proper proceedings (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only a U.S. judgment that is enforceable in the jurisdiction of the U.S. court which rendered it can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the _res _judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in_ 361 ----- France after all remedies have been exhausted. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal, the appeal Court decision also being rendered on the ground of the above-mentioned criteria. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 Decree No. 2022-207 of February 18, 2022 and Order of the Ministry of Economy of March 7, 2022 (all relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with or in view of a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with applicable international treaties or agreements and laws and regulations in force (such as the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad). Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of 6 January, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) and the General Data Protection Regulation (i.e., Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code apply only to the extent there is no other legal basis for French courts’ jurisdiction. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. More specifically, according to this case law, a French defendant can no longer challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign court on the basis of Article 15 of the French Civil Code in circumstances where the foreign tribunal has otherwise jurisdiction. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court or by virtue of a jurisdiction clause in favour of a foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction (among unlimited options) was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. 362 ----- Finally, please note that any document submitted as evidence by the parties which is not in the French language may be required to be translated into French for the purpose of any proceedings brought before a French court in respect thereof (although such translations do not need to be made before the relevant proceedings are commenced). 363 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,589

Of these restaurants, 91 were contributed following the contributions of Groupe Flo and other subsidiaries on 31 October 2023 (see note 2.2).

Expected impairments are estimated through the use of a provisioning matrix based on a history of impairments, adjusted for specific factors related to creditors, current general economic conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions that can be obtained on the closing date without having to incur excessive costs or efforts.

Non-current financial assets The change in working capital requirement of €5.3 million observed in the 2022 financial year is mainly related to: - increased activity, - the increase in receivables related to the property development activity at the Burger King France subgroup. Loans and guarantees are mainly related to security deposits paid under the lease agreements entered into by the Group as lessee. At their initial recording, they are measured at their fair value and then measured at their amortised cost. The Group also uses caps and tunnels to cover the share of its variable-rate bond debt. These derivative instruments are measured at their fair value. The method of accounting for their change in fair value depends on whether or not a documented hedging relationship exists within the meaning of IFRS 9: - In the absence of a hedging relationship, changes in fair values are recorded in the income statement; - If a cash flow hedging relationship is documented, the change in fair value of the hedging derivative is initially recorded in other items of comprehensive income for the effective portion and directly in the income statement for the ineffective portion of the change. However, the time value of options is accounted for separately as a hedging cost. It is recorded in other items of comprehensive income.

A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

The Group’s chief operating decision-maker is the Board of Directors.

44_6,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,912,BERTRAND FRANCHISE S A S,912.11,Consolidation of subsidiaries,912.11.4,,"A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls a subsidiary when it is exposed or is entitled to variable returns due to its links with the entity and has the ability to influence these returns due to its power over it. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is gained until the date on which the control ceases.

The Group does not hold a stake in the partners Group believed it did not have control of the except in temporary special cases, and the Group companies managing the restaurants in question does not grant any loan or current account to the insofar as the partners have rights deemed partners. ----- ###### 4.2. Company acquisition and takeover Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method when they give control to the Group. Thus, the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company are generally accounted for at fair value on the date of acquisition when a business combination complies with the definition of IFRS 3. In accordance with IFRS 3, a transaction under common control should be taken into account as soon as all the entities being combined are ultimately controlled by the same party, both before and after the combination and without the control being only temporary. Since IFRS 3 does not have any specific application or directive for this purpose, this type of combination is outside its scope. In the absence of standards governing the accounting treatment of business combinations between entities under common control, management must establish an accounting method in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Methods, Changes in Accounting Estimates, and Errors. The Group has therefore chosen to account for combinations under common control according to the acquisition method, applying IFRS 3 – Business Combinations in its consolidated financial statements by analogy. Goodwill is calculated as the total of the fair value of the transferred consideration (including the fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired company) plus the amount recorded for any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company, minus the net amount recorded (usually at fair value) for identifiable assets and liabilities taken over. Non-controlling interests are measured, optionally at each takeover, either up to the share of identifiable net assets or at fair value. When the difference determined in this way is negative, and after reassessment of the different components of the equation, the gain resulting from an acquisition made under advantageous conditions is immediately recognised in profit or loss in “other non-current income and expenses”. Subsequently, goodwill is assessed at its cost less any write-downs representative of impairment. Writedowns are immediately recorded in profit or loss and are irreversible in accordance with IAS 36. ###### 4.2.1. Acquisitions related to the establishment of Bertrand Franchise As part of the reorganisation of the Bertrand Group (see note 2.1 in the “reorganisation” section), the Bertrand Franchise Group received the contributions of 100% of the shares in the capital of Flo Group, United Lab, Miditsuco GB (parent company of the Itsu subgroup), Holdco GB (parent company of the Pitaya subgroup), and Bertrand Franchise Services (parent company of Bertrand Franchise Logistics) on 31 October 2023, paid for via a capital increase. All of these entities and activities were and remain controlled by the Bertrand Group, held by the BH Group head company. In this case, the shareholding of all the parties falling within the scope of the transaction remains under the ultimate control of the BH entity. In addition, the operations making up these consolidated financial statements remain under the direct management of the historical management of Bertrand Franchise, characterising the transaction as under common control. The Group, historically TopCo GB and including historical operational entities (mainly Burger King), is considered the acquirer of these ----- operations for accounting purposes in accordance with IFRS 3. The provisional allocation of the purchase price on the takeover date, for a 100% share acquired, can be summarised as follows: ----- The work in valuing assets and liabilities and the allocation of the purchase price, as required by IFRS 3, were assessed by an independent expert. This assessment work is still ongoing and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3. If, within this period, new information is obtained regarding events and circumstances that prevailed on the date of acquisition and would lead to the adjustment of the amounts below, the accounting for the acquisition will be adjusted retrospectively. Intangible assets include trademarks, lease rights, and franchise agreements valued at €405.1 million, €15.2 million, and €58.7 million, respectively. Franchise agreements are amortised over a period of 13 to 15 years; trademarks and lease rights are not amortised. The contributed companies have cumulative tax loss carryovers of €230.6 million, of which €182.4 million (i.e. €47.1 million of deferred tax assets) was capitalised up to the amount of the taxable temporary differences recognised in provisional net assets, taking into account a cap on the shortfall allocable annually to taxable profits up to 50% and taking into account the tax provisions applicable in France. This capitalisation takes into account the tax consolidations recorded prior to the acquisition, and which will take effect in 2024. Given the uncertainty regarding future earnings forecasts, residual tax losses were not capitalised. The contribution of Bertrand Casual Food to the Group’s revenue and net income following the acquisitions and contribution of securities of Flo Group, United Lab, Miditsuco GB, and Holdco GB (see note 2.1) is €49.7 million and €-12.0 million, respectively, and is presented within the Group’s consolidated financial position. If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2023, the Group estimates that these contributions to revenue and net income would have been €270.6 million and €(34.8) million, respectively. Acquisition costs related to the transaction amounted to €16.5 million in the 2023 financial year and were recorded in the amount of €15.4 million as a reduction of equity for costs directly attributable to capital increase transactions (see note 12). The balance was recorded in “other non-current income and expenses”. ###### 4.2.2. Acquisition of Burger King La Réunion On 16 June 2023, the subgroup Burger King France purchased a majority share in the Burger King operations on the Island of Réunion carried out by the companies S2FOI (which directly owns and operates 17 restaurants on the island) and DISTRIFOOD (which manages a dedicated purchasing and logistics centre). These two companies were acquired on 1 June 2023 via the company BK La Réunion, 70% owned by Financière BKF. On 1 April 2023, the Burger King France subgroup also acquired two companies, each housing a Burger King restaurant: DDNP and TPN. The provisional allocation of the purchase price on the takeover date can be summarised as follows: ----- The amount shown in the statement of cash flows for “acquisitions of subsidiaries, net of cash” also includes the retrocession of 30% of Burger King La Réunion’s shares to Iriben for €6 million. The work in valuing assets and liabilities and the allocation of the purchase price, as required by IFRS 3, were assessed by an independent expert. This assessment work is still ongoing and will be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3. If, within this period, new information is obtained regarding events and circumstances that prevailed on the date of acquisition and would lead to the adjustment of the amounts below, the accounting for the acquisition will be adjusted as a result. ----- Non-controlling interests were valued using the fair value method. Furthermore, as part of the transaction, non-controlling interest purchase agreements were implemented via put agreements for €11.7 million (see note 4.5.). Burger King La Réunion’s contribution to the Group’s revenue and net income since the acquisition on 16 June 2023 is €28.3 million and €-4.5 million, respectively, and is presented ###### 4.3. Scope of consolidation In 2023, the group created 5 companies: BK Newco 3, BK Newco 4, VALB6, CLO143, and SERPE07. Companies accounted for under the equity method are non-significant joint ventures. The Group consolidates the following subgroups and entities using the full consolidation method if it believes it has control of them: Aqaking (exAgaquick), 50% owned by the Burger King France within the Group’s consolidated financial position. If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2023, the Group estimates that these contributions to revenue and net income would have been €49.6 million and €-2.3 million, respectively. Acquisition costs related to the transaction amounted to €1.6 million in the 2023 financial year (see note 6.4). subgroup; Pitaya Paris les Cannettes, 33% owned; ThaiFood Darcy, 50% owned; and Althai, 51% owned.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: ###### • Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ###### • Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. ###### • Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. ###### • Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. ###### • Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ----- ###### • Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP AND ITS OPERATIONS Bertrand Franchise (the “Company”) is a _société _par actions simplifiée [simplified joint stock_ company] under French law. Its registered office is located at 34 Rue Mozart, 92110 Clichy. The Company is registered in the Nanterre Trade and Companies Register under number 839 070 067. This Company had its corporate name changed in the 2023 financial year and was previously called TopCo GB. Bertrand Franchise is a subsidiary of the Bertrand Group, the first independent French group in the restaurant and hotel industry whose operational development has resulted in a brand new organisation in 2023: the Bertrand Group is now deployed around 2 distinct and autonomous business areas, from both a legal and financial standpoint and an operational standpoint: Bertrand Hospitality and Bertrand Franchise. These financial statements constitute the first consolidated financial statements of the Bertrand Franchise Group within the meaning of IFRS 1. At the time of their preparation, 1 January 2022 is considered the first date of application. Since the Group is controlled by Bertrand Group, it had never previously prepared consolidated financial statements (see note 3.2). Before this new organisation, the Company had control of the Burger King France Group. Since the reorganisation (see note 2.1), Bertrand Franchise has been the platform for multisegment franchise food service brands, and is now positioned as the French leader in franchise food service. Diversified and multi-brand, this group manages brands with different positioning: - Burger King®, a fast food chain predominantly serving hamburgers, using its own “flame broiled” cooking expertise and techniques; - Bertrand Casual Food-themed dining, which includes: `o` Au Bureau® [At the Office]: restaurant chain with an English pub and Brasserie concept; `o` Hippopotamus®: a restaurant chain specialising in beef and grilled meat in a steakhouse format; `o` Léon Fish Brasserie®: restaurant chain specialising in seafood, fish, and fresh mussels cooked on-site; `o` Volfoni®: fast food chain specialising in quality traditional Italian cuisine; `o` Pitaya®: restaurant chain specialising in Thai street food; `o` Itsu®: specialising in Asian-inspired cuisine. The consolidated financial statements present the accounting position of Bertrand Franchise S.A.S and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), as well as its holdings in the joint ventures. The Group’s reference financial year is from 1 January to 31 December. The consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 were approved by the president on 15 May 2024 and will be submitted for approval by the next ordinary general meeting. ----- #### 2.

According to IFRS 16, a contract or part of a contract is or contains a lease if it grants the right to control the use of an identified asset for a certain period, in exchange for a consideration. The terms of the leases used to determine the rights of use were determined in accordance with the IFRS IC decision published on 16 December, 2019 and the statement of conclusions of the Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) of 3 July, 2020, which cancels and replaces the one dated 16 February, 2018, to determine the IFRS 16 terms of the French leases “3/6/9” in particular being in a tacit renewal position. The Group shows the “rights to use” asset on a line dedicated to the balance sheet asset and shows the rent debts on lines separate from the “current/non-current financial debts”, entitled “current/noncurrent rent debts” of the statement of the financial situation. ----- The Group accounts for a “rights of use” asset and rent debt on the start date of the lease agreement. The “rights-of-use” asset is initially valued at cost, then, at cost less any amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, with the amount subject to adjustment based on certain revaluations of the rent liability. The lease debt is initially valued at the present value of the rents due but not yet paid at the contract start date. The discount rate used corresponds to the implicit interest rate of the contract or, if it cannot be easily determined, to the marginal borrowing rates (based on duration and not maturity) per lessee. These latter rates are used by the Group as discount rates. The rent debt is then increased by the interest expense and reduced by the amount of rent paid. It is revalued in the event of a revision of future rents following a change in index or rate, a new estimate of the amount expected to be paid under a residual value guarantee or, where applicable, a revaluation, the exercise of a purchase or extension option or the non-exercise of a termination option (which then become reasonably certain).

Consequently, the right to the lease constitutes an initial direct cost to the Group as lessee, which is taken into account in the initial valuation of the rights of use of the asset. It was considered that the right of use consists of two distinct significant components, having different consumption rates of their future economic benefits, and must be amortised separately: - The “right to lease”; - The other elements constituting the right of use. For the “right to lease” component, an analysis of the sites concerned showed that in the vast majority of cases the premium nature and location guaranteed a residual value at the end of the lease at least equal to the current value. As a result, no amortisation of this component is recognised. The other elements constituting the right of use are amortised over the useful life of the right of use, i.e. the term of the lease agreement. The rights of use are broken down as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2024,589
