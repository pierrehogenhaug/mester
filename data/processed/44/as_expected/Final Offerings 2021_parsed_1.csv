These forward-looking statements include matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Listing Prospectus and include statements regarding the Issuer’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Group’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, competition in areas of the Group’s business, outlook and growth prospects, strategies and the industry in which the Group operates. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. You are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that the Group’s actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Listing Prospectus. In addition, even if the Group’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Listing Prospectus, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause those material differences include: - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics on the Group’s business; - the impact of competition on the Group’s business; - the significantly greater financial resources of the Group’s main competitor; - the Group’s dependence on the economic conditions in France; - the impact of unforeseen events such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events; - the Group’s dependence on our franchisor and the success of the Burger King brand worldwide; - food safety, food traceability, food borne illness and hygiene-related concerns; - the Group’s ability to adopt new ESG policies; - the effectiveness of the Group’s marketing and advertising programs and franchisee support of these programs; - the dependence on our corporate reputation and the value and perception of the Burger King brand; ----- - the Group’s ability to control franchisees and to implement the Group’s strategic initiatives; - the Group’s ability to retain franchisees; - the impact of changes in raw material costs, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs; - the impact of shortages or interruptions on the availability and delivery of raw materials; - the impact of higher employment costs; - the impact of changes in consumer preferences and perceptions; - the Group’s ability to successfully implement its restaurant development and growth strategy; - the lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or decline in the quality of the locations of the Group’s current restaurants; - the Group’s ability to renew leases or control rent increases at its restaurant locations, or obtain leases for new restaurants; - the Group’s exposure to risks related to litigation and negative publicity, including litigation with franchisees; - the Group’s ability to adequately protect its intellectual property; - the Group’s ability to pursue successful disposals; - the impact of IT system failures or interruptions or breaches of the Group’s network security; - the ability to adequately protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees; - the risk of amplified negative publicity due to the increased use of social media; - the impact of legislation and regulations requiring more transparency in the Group’s business; - the Group’s ability to promote its products to its key target market through media advertising; - the adoption of new governmental regulations; - the adoption of new environmental regulations; i ----- - the adequacy of the Group’s insurance coverage against claims; - the Group’s reliance on key executives; - tax risks; - the impact of tax changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position; - the Group’s ability to deduct all or a portion of the interest on its indebtedness incurred in France; - risks related to the Group’s presentation of financial and other information; - risks related to the Issuers’ and their subsidiaries’ indebtedness; and - risks related to the Notes and the Collateral. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Moreover, the Group operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Issuers to predict all such risk factors on the Group’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus, the Issuers also present certain run-rate adjustments to the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA which model the additional EBITDA the Group would have generated for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 if all of the Burger King restaurants opened or converted from September 2, 2020 to August 31, 2021 had been operational during an entire twelve-month period. Such Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection of future performance and investors should not place undue reliance thereon. Such information is based on mathematical averages of ARS and certain other estimates and assumptions which are further described under “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Indicators—Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”._ You are urged to read the sections of this Listing Prospectus entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect the Group’s future performance and the markets in which the Group’s operates. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements in this Listing Prospectus may not occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. Neither the Issuers nor any of their subsidiaries assumes any obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this Listing Prospectus to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in factors affecting these statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Issuer or its subsidiaries or to persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus, including those set forth under “Risk Factors”. ii -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are Burger King France, resolutely focused on the expansion of the world’s second largest QSHR chain in the French market which is characterized by secular, long-term demand for eating out and a strong affinity for our brand. Guided by the Burger King philosophy of “Have it your way”, we offer customers a differentiated eating experience, combining high-quality food, such as our flame-grilled hamburgers, with attractive restaurant locations. In 2013, our principal shareholder Groupe Bertrand reintroduced the Burger King brand to the French market after a 15-year absence, by signing of an exclusive master franchise agreement between Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. Groupe Bertrand is a leader in the French restaurant industry, known for its ability to roll out and transform restaurant concepts. Following our acquisition in 2015 of Financière Quick Group, an incumbent QSHR operator with nearly 400 prime restaurant locations in France, we demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of our Burger King network in France, both through the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, as well as through new Burger King restaurant openings. As of June 30, 2021, we operated 412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion) and as of August 31, 2021, we operated 413 restaurants under the Burger King brand (425 restaurants including nine restaurants under the Quick brand to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and three Quick restaurants under conversion). Our mission is to continue to deliver a high-quality service to our customers and support the growth of our franchisees through expansion of new Burger King restaurants. We are committed to strict development criteria, prioritizing sustainable initiatives and seeking to exploit economies of scale to further growing our EBITDA. Our business model features a mix of predominantly Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants and Pure Franchise Restaurants, and to a lesser extent Company Restaurants. We believe this model enables us to manage our growth flexibly while controlling the locations of the restaurants in our network. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 83% of our Burger King restaurants are Franchise Restaurants under our Burger King brand and the remaining 17% are Company Restaurants, a balance that supports our gross margin and reduces our capital expenditure requirement for expansion. As of June 30, 2021, we were the direct lessee for or owner of approximately 87% of the restaurant locations in our network, compared to 85% of the restaurant locations in our network as of December 31, 2018. In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. The strong recognition of the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide, serves as a solid base to attract customers and prospective franchisees. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) for Burger King restaurants was approximately €2.8 million. 1 ----- We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with locations throughout the country and approximately 15% market share by sales of burgers in 2021 (up from 8% in 2017), generating €1,056.7 million in SWS (reported), €448.3 million in revenue and €151.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA (reported) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, with 412 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 (399 of which were under the Burger King brand).",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Attractive and resilient market in France with steady growth characteristics,"We believe that the QSR market in France benefits from strong and sustainable growth characteristics with demonstrated resilience through business cycles, as well as in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The QSR segment has historically experienced a steady growth rate in France, and we believe that it has significant untapped potential. According to GIRA Foodservice, absolute sales in the French QSR market grew at a CAGR of 6.8% per annum between 2017 and 2019 from approximately €17.1 billion in 2017 to €19.5 billion in 2019. The QSR market has historically been the key driver of growth in the OOH market, with a CAGR of 6.8% between 2017 and 2019, compared to a CAGR of 3.5% for the commercial restaurants and a CAGR of 3.0% for the total OOH). Based on GIRA Foodservice, the QSR market also increased its share of the commercial restaurants market from 32% in 2017 to 41% in 2020. Although QSR market sales temporarily decreased in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in absolute terms (decreasing by 31.2% between 2019 and 2020), according to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, sales have significantly increased by 10.6% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period during the prior year. The QSHR category in the broader QSR market also exhibited growth throughout these same periods. QSHR is the largest category within the broader QSR segment and has been a significant driver of the growth in the French QSR market. According to GIRA Foodservice, sales in the QSHR market grew at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2017 and 2019, from approximately €6.9 billion in 2017 to €8.1 billion in 2019. As with the QSR segment as a whole, the QSHR market temporarily decreased in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit at a lower rate than the QSR market. We observed the relative resilience of the QSR market and outperformance of the QSHR market during COVID-19 compared to the total commercial restaurants/total OOH, with a decrease of 22.9% in absolute sale in the QSHR segment and 31.2% in the QSR segment versus 42.2% for the total commercial and 37.7% for the total OOH in 2020 compared to 2019. Notwithstanding this temporary decrease in 2020, according to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, the QSHR market's sales increased by 29.7% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period during the prior year. Based on GIRA Foodservice, its share in the QSR market increased from 40% in 2017 to 47% in 2020. In addition, GIRA Foodservice expects sales in the QSR segment to exceed 2019 levels in 2022, with projected sales amounting to €20.6 billion in 2022 as compared to €19.5 billion in 2019. GIRA Foodservice expects the QSR market to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.8%, between 2019 and 2023, compared to a growth at a CAGR of approximately 0.6% in the overall commercial restaurants sector in France, which is expected to increase its sales from approximately €56.4 billion in 2016 to €57.7 billion in 2023. We believe the French QSR market has significant penetration potential and that we are poised to take advantage of this growth. The QSR market in France, which was a €19.5 billion market in 2019, has a lower penetration rate than other Western European countries, although it is growing fast and roughly in line with the growth rates in such other countries. For example, the QSR market grew in France at a rate of 7.4% between 2018 and 2019 and the QSHR category grew at a rate of 9.3% over the same period. Further, we believe there is significant whitespace potential in France based on the average annual commercial foodservice spend per inhabitant in France (€640), which in the year 2017 was much lower as compared to its neighboring countries, such as the United Kingdom (€831) or Belgium (€842), according to GIRA Foodservice. The French market is generally characterized by more stringent anti-competition regulations than other Western European markets, limiting the number of chains in operation in France, which could prevent new market entrants. In addition, we believe that our 2 ----- successful business model serves as a barrier to entry because brand equity and prime locations throughout mainland France cannot be easily replicated by new entrants due to the significant investment levels required and the necessary time to attain our economies of scale, operational and logistics know-how. As a result, through our established presence in the French market, we believe we have a strong competitive advantage in the face of potential competitors or new market entrants. This long-term growth potential is underpinned by structural changes in customer habits and way of life, which we believe are favorable for QSR restaurant operators. These trends include increasing digital penetration and out-of-home convenience-oriented food consumption, favoring value for money, preferences for health-conscious and quality product offerings and the expansion of daypart opportunities. Such structural trends in French society foster an increased demand for the QSR segment. According to NPD, there has been a 5 percentage points growth in share of restaurant chains to 61% as of March 2021 year on year. Furthermore, 46% of French people name attractive price as their main selection criteria for a restaurant. Certain of these favorable trends were accelerated as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, customers have more increasingly relied on digital channels (such as home delivery and Click & Collect options) and convenient and affordable dining options. According to NPD, the QSR share of commercial restaurants digital orders is now 81% with a 22% growth in digital orders as of March 2021 year on year. Approximately 90% of Burger King France restaurants offer Click & Collect following the launch in 2020. Customers have also demonstrated their loyalty to strong brands that successfully address the aforementioned evolving preferences. See “Industry”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

In the last few years, the sizes of our respective Burger King brand network and franchise network have significantly expanded, with our Burger King brand network almost doubling from 203 restaurants as of December 31, 2017 to 399 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 and our franchise network for Burger King restaurants increasing from 158 franchise restaurants as of December 31, 2017 to 330 franchise restaurants as of June 30, 2021. Throughout these periods, our Group has also demonstrated strong sales per unit, with ARS for the year ended December 31, 2019 of €3.2 million. Our leading market position in France is underpinned by the distinctive Burger King global brand and high local recognition in France. We are Burger King’s master franchisee in France and are well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry worldwide. Burger King is the world’s second largest QSHR chain in terms of total number of restaurants with over 18,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The chain had more than $20.0 billion of SWS for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a Burger King master franchisee we benefit from Burger King’s international brand awareness, its distinctive product offer, unique cooking method, efficient and reliable supply chains and food quality reputation. We also benefit from Burger King's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and generate increased footfall in our restaurants. Over the years, Burger King has launched innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns that highlight the popular relevance of the Burger King brand globally. We believe we are well positioned to further increase our market position by closing the market share gap between ourselves and McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, which held 69% market share as of the first half of 2021 Our strong brand awareness and growing market share are supported by our high-quality and innovative product offering, our focus on expanding digital convenience options for our customers and our unique local communication strategy. Our focus on innovation in terms of digital convenience for our customers has further contributed to the strengthening of our market share. Following the launch of home delivery and Click & Collection options respectively in 2019 and in 2020, our market share of digital sales (measured by the number of transactions) steadily increased to 14% as of March 2021. In addition, we also expanded our digital sales channel in 2020 through the mobile 3 ----- Burger King app, which now includes our expanded customer loyalty program. Our Burger King app was downloaded on average 5,000 times a day during the first six months of 2021 and has increased to a daily download rate of 10,000 times a day during promotions. Our Kingdom loyalty program had more than 3.6 million registered members as of the end of September 2021. In addition, over the last few years we have expanded home delivery options through our partnerships with home delivery services such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. Our rate of home delivery increased by four times from 15 transactions per day per restaurant in July and August 2019 to more than 60 transactions per day per restaurant in July and August 2021. We expect the volume of our digital sales to increase, along with growth in the French QSR market and as digital penetration grows in line with increased focus on digital convenience. We enjoy strong brand recognition in France, supported by customer's perception of the taste and quality of our products according to KANTAR. In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. In addition, we invest annually (through contributions from both our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants) in innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns at the French national level, which we believe reinforce Burger King’s growing brand awareness in France and have a positive impact on our level of SWS. According to an IFOP (Institut français d'opinion publique) survey on the French population, our brand awareness has improved in France from 72% Spontaneous Awareness in 2018 to 83% in 2021 while our Total Brand Awareness has remained stable reflecting 91% in both 2018 and 2021. In addition, according to KANTAR, our brand equity has also improved, with an increase in the power of our brand equity from 18 in March 2018 to 21 in April 2021 (out an index of 100). The strong and growing recognition of the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide, serves as a solid base to further increase our market share.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Broad footprint and diversified channel mix with strong digital and contactless capabilities,"Our extensive restaurant network reflects a balanced approach of different formats and sizes appropriately tailored for each of the locations in which we operate. We choose our restaurant sites carefully and have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process that incorporates our management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our restaurant development team has extensive experience identifying and evaluating suitable restaurant locations. As of June 30, 2021, we operated a network of 412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the shortterm and two Quick restaurants under conversion). At each of our sites, we select and develop one of three of our principal restaurant formats: a free-standing drive-through facility format, a downtown format and a shopping center or mall format. As of June 30, 2021, 328 of our restaurants reflected a drive-through facility format, 39 of our restaurants reflected a downtown format, 26 of our restaurants reflected a shopping center or mall format and 19 restaurants reflected other formats (including restaurants located in travel locations such as airports, train stations and highway service concessions). For our drive-through facility restaurants, which have historically represented our largest restaurant type, we have developed three different restaurants sizes to best address market potential. We are also focused on ensuring that most of our restaurant locations are well-suited to offer both take away and home delivery services to our customers. We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed complementary multi-channel offerings that we believe have favorably positioned us to respond to evolving customer trends. Particularly, we believe our multi-channel offering has underpinned the resilience of our business (including during COVID-19) and maximize customer reach. Our customers can access our product offer through multiple channels, including on-site through in-restaurant dining or drive-through orders, online through Click & Collect services (which include services for on-site Click & Collect pick up through our parking lots or drive-through lines or home delivery) and home delivery services (either through third-party aggregators such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. In addition, we intend to begin to roll out our own home-delivery services in certain locations, which we believe demonstrate an opportunity to further develop our multi-channel approach. 4 ----- A breakdown comparing our SWS by channel for the December 2019 and August 2021 period are reflected in the chart below: We have further optimized our restaurants and customer journey with a number of digital initiatives that are consistent across all of our channels to better cater to our customers and improve their dining experience. For example, we have enhanced our drive-through experience by accelerating the order process through the use of digital tablets in our drive-through sites. All our restaurants have been equipped with in-store kiosks since 2015. Since 2019, our drive-through capacity has doubled based on the average number of cars per hour that passed through the drive-through. We have also developed our mobile app to allow for Click & Collect orders directly in-app to facilitate easy ordering. To further improve customers' in-dining experience, in 2021 we rolled out geolocalized table service in approximately 250 restaurant locations, allowing dine-in customers to receive their meals directly at their table and further supporting market share gains in the key target family demographic. As of the date hereof, table service is available in more than half of our restaurant network, and we are targeting the implementation of this service in approximately 80% to 90% of our restaurant network by the end of 2022. Customers can also now register purchases to their loyalty programs via scanner capabilities on every touch point in order to facilitate customer identification. Thanks to our single PoS IT system that is fully integrated across all of our network and distribution channels, we are able to achieve futureproof and scalable state-of-the-art operations monitoring and process management.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.4,Agile business model with best-in-class operational expertise,"We believe navigating the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business model and our ability to respond quickly to unprecedented business disruption. At the on-set of the pandemic, our management team rapidly implemented various cash management measures to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our operations and liquidity position. Our management team prioritized various initiatives to strengthen our liquidity position, including by drawing in full our Existing Revolving Credit Facility for a total of €60 million and entering into the state-guaranteed PGE Loan (contrat de prêts garantis par l’État français) for a total of €80 million. In addition, in an effort to manage cash during the restrictive periods of the pandemic, we ceased most external service expenditures such as cleaning, security and maintenance, both in our restaurants and at our headquarters, and temporarily renegotiated our rental obligations of certain of our Company Restaurants and supported our franchisees in the renegotiations of their rental obligations for certain periods with our landlords. As a result, we were able to maintain a strong level of free cash flow since the start of the pandemic. Further, we were focused on supporting our franchisees through the challenges of the pandemic and closely monitored their financial health, adapting our support initiatives as the impact of the pandemic on our franchisees' performance evolved. For example, during the period 5 ----- of the first lockdown in France, we implemented temporary royalty adjustments for our franchisees. We also temporarily waived the obligation of our franchisees to pay us a minimum lease management fee. As a result of such measures, none of our franchisees experienced a default of their payment obligations to third parties. We further believe that our strong restaurant-level operations coupled with our tight cost control and disciplined cash management have allowed us to further enhance our resilient model to withstand any future crises. In response to the pandemic, we implemented robust operational protocols to safely continue our activity in compliance with government restrictions. While our restaurant opening plan was impacted by the pandemic, we were still able to open a number of new restaurants during the COVID19 period and plan to continue to carry out the final conversions from the few remaining Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, which we believe demonstrates the confidence of our franchisees and the strength of our strategy. In addition, in continuation of our digital strategy and to cope with external restrictions, we further enhanced our multi-channel offerings, including through the expansion of our drive-through and takeaway services by using new Click & Collect channels as of July 2020, the development of our home delivery options and our integration with third-party delivery aggregators. The further enhancement of such offerings allowed us to protect our top line during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions by offsetting the reduction in on-premise customer traffic and allowing customers to access our products through alternate channels. Following the return of on-premises dining with the easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures, we continue to benefit from the robust contribution of our off-premises channels, such as delivery and Click & Collect options. We also regularly and proactively communicated with our customers, which had a positive impact on our brand image. In response to a KANTAR survey in April 2021 which asked to what extent customers' image of fast food brands has improved, maintained or gotten worse in the last months of the COVID-19 pandemic, 25% of respondents indicated that Burger King had improved. Pursuant to the survey results, Burger King's operations reflected the highest proportion of responses indicating improvement as compared to other fast food chains in France that were mentioned in the survey, including McDonald's, KFC, Domino's and Subway. In addition to the foregoing measures, we remained committed throughout the pandemic periods to our ESG best practices, including introducing menu innovations that were healthy and nutritious, such as the launch of our bowls and plant based offerings, and our continued efforts to enhance our supply chain with local sourcing and pro-environment initiatives. We believe that our SWS before and after each of the most severe COVID-19-related restrictive periods in France (i.e., the first and second lockdowns in March to May 2020 and October to December 2020) demonstrate our ability to rapidly ramp up and down, with monthly sales immediately following each lockdown nearly recovering to pre-lockdown periods. For example, in June 2020, our SWS under the Burger King brand recovered to €73 million as compared to the €85 million pre-lockdown level in February 2020. Similarly, in December 2020, the month during which the second lockdown restrictions were lifted, our SWS reached €86 million as compared to the €94 million pre-lockdown SWS recorded in October 2020. Further, despite the implementation of a curfew in France ending in June 2021, we were able to achieve consistently increasing SWS levels from April 2021 through August 2021, which we believe emphasizes the resilience of our business model, further supported by the long-term integration of the measures we adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a demonstration of this resilience our SWS in the months following the easing of lockdown restrictions in July and August 2021 reached historically record levels. 6 ----- A breakdown of our SWS for each of our channels over the course of first lockdown, second lockdown and post-lockdown periods is presented below: Further, a breakdown of our monthly SWS during the period beginning January 1, 2020 through August 31, 2021, as well as a breakdown of our quarterly EBITDA over those same periods, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2019 is presented below:",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.5,Asset-light business model with high cash conversion,"Our successful franchise-based business model, including a robust network of committed franchise partners, generates recurring and predictable revenues with high EBITDA margin. As of June 30, 2021, 83% of our Burger King network restaurants were Franchise Restaurants under our Burger King brand (compared to 70% as of December 31, 2016), with 17% of our restaurants operated as Company Restaurants (compared to 30% as of December 31, 2016). While our previous strategy was focused on the conversion of Quick restaurants and the progressive switch toward franchise restaurants, our current approach reflects a continuous focus on franchising most of our restaurants (29 out of 30 restaurant openings were franchise restaurants over the six-month period ended June 30, 7 ----- 2021), and we are now moving from conversions to new openings. This asset-light model allows for higher cash conversion and reduces or eliminates for locations with third-party landlord agreements our capital expenditures for such franchise openings. The table below demonstrates our enhanced cash conversion (measured as pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA minus restaurant opening and conversion capex divided by pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA) in recent years following our adoption of an asset-light franchise-focused model for new restaurant openings, as compared to prior years. Our annual cash conversion ratio increased from 4%, 2% and 19%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as compared to 73%, 59% and 74%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and the twelve months ended August 31, 2021. We believe that our ""asset-light"" operating model generates enhanced cash conversion and significant recurring free cash flow primarily driven by royalties and lease payments collected from franchisees based on sales levels, while limiting our capital expenditures. The corporate infrastructure and capital expenditures necessary to support a franchise business model are substantially less than a company-operated system, as franchisees and landlords assume most capital expenditure costs. In particular, most of our openings are operated by franchisees under a lease management contract, and when this franchise model is combined with third party landlord agreements we bear no capital expenditure. We expect the continued success of our asset-light operating model, underpinned by the completion of most of our Quick conversions pursuant to the disposal of most of our Quick restaurants (see “Business—Our Business—Quick Disposal”) and our continued preference for the Franchise with Lease Management arrangements combined where possible with third party landlord agreements. In addition, our franchise-based model allows us to retain strong control over our network through our standard agreements with our franchisees, which govern various aspects of our relationship, including the royalties and fees due by them to us. We believe that our franchise model offers us favorable upsides and that our emphasis on growing this model in the future will continue to drive high cash conversion.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Our Chief Financial Officer, Xavier Cottineau, joined the Group in September 2016 after serving as Chief Financial Officer at Financière Louis, as Finance Vice President at EuroDisney and senior financial auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our experienced management team has a long and successful history with a proven track record of developing, integrating and operating in the QSR segment and has managed to lead our Group through evolutions to its business model, support our Group's growing network (including its organic growth trajectory) and execute M&A transactions to further our business strategies. Our management team has also successfully managed our business through challenges 8 ----- that accompanied evolving government regulations and customer behavior in the face of the COVID19 crisis, and guided the recovery of our operations to strong levels following the easing of COVID-19 related restaurant closure measures. We also benefit from the support and expertise of our significant shareholders, Groupe Bertrand, which is a leading French operator of restaurant chains, and Bridgepoint, which is an international alternative assed fund management group. Each of our shareholders provides us with long-term support through their respective and complementary expertise. Groupe Bertrand was founded by Olivier Bertrand more than 20 years ago. Groupe Bertrand has created and managed a fast growing restaurant franchise group in France, with over 900 restaurants (both franchises and owned restaurants) under management. Groupe Bertrand has demonstrated that it considers network development over the long term, applies a cautious approach to risk management and enjoys a strong entrepreneurial culture, which serve as further support to our senior management.

We also seek to expand our product offering by relying on our expertise in creating innovative, premium convenience food products that match customers’ demand, which we believe will be a key driver of our revenues. For example, we intend to continue to expand our healthy and nutritious product offering through the introduction of additional healthy options and preservative-free ingredients to further capture key markets, such as families, and anticipate market trends toward local sourcing, value-for-money products and healthy food options as well as meatless alternatives and products with no animal protein. We also plan to further strengthen our multi-channel approach through the enhancement of takeaway options and the development of new digital sales channels to further drive our growth. Finally, we intend to capitalize on increased consumption opportunities by the continued operation of our restaurants in the afternoon or late-night hours. We believe that we will continue to benefit from the support that BKC provides through its menu items, product enhancements and reimaging initiatives, which combined with our continuous innovation and operational expertise, will help drive overall consumption levels in the currently moderately-penetrated French QSR segment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

While we have already successfully integrated the use of in-app orders and pre-orders, Click & Collect orders, in-store tablets that allow customers to skip the line and home delivery options with third-party aggregators, we also see opportunity in expanding our digital channels, through, for example, white-label delivery. We believe that the current trends and growth observed in our digital sales, accelerated as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate a distribution channel that adapts to the changing preferences of our customers and is complementary to our in-restaurant dining channel.

Our key strategic ESG pillars include: (i) adapting our product offering to address future global challenges, (ii) promoting the well-being of our teams and (iii) limiting our environmental impact. With respect to our product offering, we intend to continue to promote local and quality product sourcing, innovate our offer to provide healthy and responsible food options (through, for example, a full permanent range of plant-based burgers, wraps, salads and sandwiches without animal protein) and apply stringent safety standards to our operations. In promoting the well-being of our teams, our goal is to create an inclusive workplace with frequent staff trainings and an emphasis on fighting against harassment. We are also focused on limiting our environmental impact through waste management initiatives, continued improvement of our logistics services and responsible growth of our business. We also seek to prioritize ESG initiatives in order to create and share value with our stakeholders.

Our network of Burger King brand restaurants expanded from 16 as of December 31, 2014 to 399 as of June 30, 2021. Following the Quick Disposal, we expect our network to increase, with over 400 targeted locations already identified, providing us with significant room for further growth, particularly in light of the moderatelypenetrated French QSR market. For example, McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, has a denser network of restaurants in France than Burger King, with approximately 1,500 restaurants (as of June 2021) for McDonald’s, compared to 412 restaurants (as of June 2021) for Burger King (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion). We believe we are well-positioned to close the network density gap between ourselves and McDonald's and to further increase our market positioning. We plan to further expand our Burger King brand restaurant network in collaboration with current and new franchisees to continue to increase our market share in the French QSHR category. We expect that a higher density of restaurants will further contribute to brand awareness, support customer loyalty and increase traffic in our existing restaurants, while our new restaurants will benefit from our strong brand, reputation and know-how. We have a rigorous approach to expansion and expect to promote new restaurant growth through the opening of Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, which allow us to retain a high degree of control over our network of restaurants, with limited capital expenditure. Opening Company Restaurants requires significantly higher capital expenditures and adds leases and personnel costs to our cost structure, whereas in franchise arrangements, the cost impact of adding a new Franchise Restaurant is significantly reduced. As a result, we intend to control the number of new Company Restaurants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.5,Focus on cost control and economies of scale,"We intend to continue to improve our gross margin and profitable expansion through the optimization of our supply chain and marketing. While Franchisees bear the food and logistic costs for their restaurants, we organize and negotiate the sourcing for both Company and Franchise restaurants. We source a wide range of ingredients, including beef and chicken, potatoes and other fresh and frozen products and a variety of sauces to form our menu and we also incur logistics costs to store inventory and transport raw materials and semi-finished products to such restaurant locations. Our food and logistics costs are significant, and we believe that we could drive our gross margin through enhanced control of our logistics costs by exploiting economies of scale in line with the growth of our restaurant network, further developing local supplier networks and implementing cost control measures to reduce 10 ----- food waste. For example, we require all of our Burger King franchisees to source their raw materials from suppliers that BKC has previously approved and with whom we intend to continue to leverage our extensive restaurant network and economies of scale to obtain the most favorable commercial terms. In addition, suppliers have sought to invest in long-term partnerships with us, which has allowed us to reduce food costs and secure dedicated product lines to satisfy our needs. We also intend to enter into exclusive deals with our suppliers, such as with Coca Cola or Nutella, driven by our brand image and growth prospects. Apart from focusing on the optimization of our supply chain, we intend to further develop our communication and advertising campaigns to promote our brands, product offerings and commercial offers in order to reinforce awareness of the Burger King brand, build on our image and increase customer traffic, which we believe will also contribute to the improvement of our gross margin and profitable expansion.

As such, you should not place undue reliance on the inclusion of the preliminary financial results in this document, it should not be regarded as an indication that such preliminary financial results will be an accurate prediction of future events, and such information should not be relied on as such. See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations._ Based on preliminary management accounts, we expect our SWS for the eight months ended August 31, 2021, to be approximately €907.2 million (€755.0 million from our continued operations and €152.2 million from our discontinued operations), compared to €661.3 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 (€543.0 million from our continued operations and €118.3 million from our discontinued operations). We believe the principal factors driving the growth in SWS for the eight months ended 12 ----- August 31, 2020, were the strong rebound in activity and accelerated recovery of our operations following the easing of COVID-19-related lockdown measures beginning in May 2021, as well as new restaurant openings during this period. Further, we believe that the robust performance of delivery, drive-through and takeaway channels compensated for the reduction of on-premises traffic in our restaurants. Based on our preliminary accounts, we expect that the months of July and August 2021 each demonstrated record monthly SWS levels for the Burger King brand in France. In addition, according to management's analysis of preliminary management accounts, we expect our post-IFRS16 EBITDA for the eight months ended August 31, 2021 to be approximately €126.4 million (€104.8 million from our continued operations and €21.6 million from our discontinued operations), compared to €68.3 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 (€53.3 million from our continued operations and €15.0 million from our discontinued operations), reflecting an EBITDA for the continued operations for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 of €160.9 million. Despite the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on our operations, we expect our SWS and EBITDA for the eight months ended August 31, 2021, to approach 2019 pre-COVID levels. Further, based on preliminary management accounts, we expect our Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA to be €176.1 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our operations, including by requiring us to manage the numbers of customers in our restaurants, reduce or temporarily close the operation of certain of our restaurants following evolving guidelines or orders by the French government, invest in protective and other safety equipment and increase our reliance on home delivery and Click & Collect purchase options. We have also faced the risk of product delivery delays or shortages as suppliers adapted to government-mandated restrictions. Further, as a result of the pandemic and government-imposed lockdown restrictions, consumers’ expectations with regard to eating out, particularly with regard to safety and convenience, have changed. For example, the pandemic significantly accelerated the trend of consumer reliance on food delivery options. If consumers’ heavy reliance on delivery services continues and if the trend towards a long-term increase in delivery services compared to pre-pandemic levels is confirmed, even upon the easing of pandemic restrictions, we may continue to face in the longer-term the inherent risks associated with delivery services. See “—Our business is affected by _changes in consumer preferences and perceptions” for a description of the risks associated with a_ sustained level of increased delivery activity. As from March 2020, as a response to COVID-19, we complied with government-mandated shutdowns of restaurants, country-wide lockdowns and safety measures across all our operations in France. As a result of the first lockdown in France, a large majority of our restaurants were shut down from March 17, 2020 through the end of April 2020, after which we underwent, and are still undergoing, a period of gradual and progressive reopening of all our restaurants. We currently only have three remaining restaurants that have not yet reopened: two of which are located in airports, one of which is located in a train station and one of which is located at La Cité des Sciences in Paris and is scheduled to reopen in the short term. During the second lockdown, which was followed by a nationwide curfew, we were able to keep most of our restaurants open, however we experienced reduced sales as a result of the lockdown restrictions. In addition, the French government announced a range of measures to 38 ----- support businesses affected by COVID-19. However, due to the size of our Group, we are limited in the government aid we can receive and, even when we are able to obtain such governmental aid, its impact is usually limited. To support our franchisees throughout the evolution of these restrictions, and in order to allow our franchisees to resume their operations following the first lockdown of 2020, we agreed to implement certain temporary royalty adjustments, which resulted in reduced revenues from our franchisees during this period. Further, as lessors of the restaurant premises under our Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with the landlords of such restaurants as their revenues decreased during this period. See “—We are _subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount of space, including future increases in occupancy costs” for a description of the potential long-term impacts of such exceptional lease_ renegotiations with our landlords. Despite ongoing vaccination rollouts, COVID-19 outbreaks remain prevalent around the world as new, more contagious strains of the virus emerge. Beginning at the end of July 2021, France has mandated the health pass (pass sanitaire) system, whereby individuals seeking to access a number of public locations, including as of August 9, 2021, restaurants, malls and long-distance public transportation, must provide proof of vaccination status or present a negative COVID-19 test. The initial enforcement of the health pass in August 2021 has had an initial negative impact on our sales which has since decreased. We cannot predict whether such an impact will continue in the future and there remains significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19. For example, following the COVID-19 outbreak, the restaurant industry has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining employees. This challenging recruitment environment may be further burdened in the short-term by the national requirement since August 30, 2021 for all employees working in contact with the public, which includes our in-store employees, to provide their employers with a valid health pass. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results of operations will depend on the ongoing development of the virus, which is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Any future mandatory shutdowns, reductions in operations or other restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot predict whether such challenging economic conditions will have any long-term effects on consumer confidence, our prices and input costs, demand for dining out experiences or volatility of raw material prices, nor can we predict if the state of the global economy will deteriorate further or when it will improve at a consistent rate. These factors may therefore continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, following the COVID-19 pandemic, most insurance companies have begun to exclude pandemics from their insurance coverage of operating losses. To the extent we renew our insurance coverage or face a subsequent pandemic, our insurance coverage of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (or other pandemics) on our operating losses would no longer be subject to coverage. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect general economic conditions or our business, operations, financial condition or operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening one or several other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,"We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business and financial results may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive pressures.","The restaurant industry in France is highly competitive. We compete primarily with other well-established international fast food restaurant chains and franchises (such as McDonald’s, our main 39 ----- competitor with a dominant market share), as well as other regional and local QSR restaurants on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service, location and the nature and condition of the restaurants in our network. The restaurant industry has few barriers to entry for opening one or numerous points of sale and therefore new competitors may emerge at any time. We may lose market share to well-established companies such as McDonald’s. Other international and national QSR chains such as KFC and Subway may also take market share as they expand in France, and new chains may enter the market. We also compete with QSR restaurants that focus on sandwiches or offer alternative menus, such as Paul, Brioche Dorée, Exki and Prêt à Manger as well as “fast casual” restaurants. Lastly, we also compete with certain segments of the food industry, such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in grocery stores as well as online food options from our competitors through ordering services platforms such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to expand our network and continue to modernize and refurbish certain of our existing restaurants, develop and roll-out new products and product line extensions, effectively respond to consumer preferences, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and franchisee network as well as the impact of our competitors’ actions, and maintain our customer’s perception of the quality and value of our products. The Burger King brand, which returned to France in 2012, is a relatively new brand compared to our main competitor, McDonald’s, which has been present in France since the 1970s and has a more established market presence, with more than three times as many restaurants and substantially greater financial resources than we do. See “—Our main competitor has a substantially larger network than we _do, and therefore we may be at a disadvantage in competing with it”._ In addition to competing for customers, we also compete for franchisees, management personnel and employees. Our competitors may be able to offer greater resources and benefits to their franchisees (for example, in terms of lower franchise royalties, advertising programs, greater training and more extensive franchise support), as well as better salaries, compensation and benefits to their management personnel and employees, all of which may enable them to attract and retain franchisees, management personnel and employees more effectively than we can. The market for suitable restaurant locations is also highly competitive and QSR companies, restaurant chains and other retail companies compete for prime real estate sites. As a result of their size advantage and/or their greater financial resources, some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable commercial lease terms than we can, and some landlords and developers may offer priority or grant exclusivity to some of our competitors for desirable locations. As a result, we may not be able to obtain leases for new restaurants or renew leases for existing restaurants on acceptable terms, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent that one of our existing or future competitors offers items that are better priced or more appealing to consumer tastes, increases the number of restaurants it operates in one of our key markets, rebrands its restaurant portfolio to better enhance the restaurant experience or has more effective advertising and marketing programs than we do, our revenue and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

According to the NPD Group, McDonald’s had a market share of 69% in the QSHR category of the QSR segment for the first quarter of 2021 based on the SWS of burgers. Its significantly greater size may enable McDonald’s to negotiate lower prices than we can from our suppliers (for 40 ----- example, in respect of raw materials) or better absorb increases in its cost base (for example, due to inflation of raw material prices and increases in labor, rental and other operating costs). McDonald’s also has a denser network of restaurants in France than Burger King, with approximately 1,500 restaurants (as of June 2021) for McDonald’s, compared to 412 restaurants (as of June 2021) for Burger King (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion). These competitive advantages may enable it to react to changes in pricing more quickly and more effectively than we can. McDonald’s can and does spend significantly more on advertising, marketing and other promotional activities than we do, which may give it a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. In addition, McDonald’s and other competitors may be able to deploy greater resources in order to accelerate restaurant openings and refurbishment efforts, to rapidly expand their offer of new products or to implement aggressive product discounting, all of which could give them a competitive advantage over us and could therefore adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under challenging economic conditions, the competitive advantages resulting from greater financial resources and economies of scale may intensify, thereby permitting McDonald’s or other competitors to gain market share. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins and revenue from Company Restaurants and royalty payments from Franchise Restaurants, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,Our business depends on the health of the French economy as the sole country in which we operate.,"Our revenue and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions, unemployment levels, the availability of discretionary income and consumer confidence, particularly in the communities where our restaurants are located. Because our restaurants are exclusively located in France, any deterioration in the French economy could have a significant effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. According to INSEE, French GDP grew at only 1.9% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019, followed by a significant drop of 7.9% in 2020, which is mainly attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While French GDP slightly rose in the first quarter of 2021 by 0.4%, a rebound to pre-pandemic levels may take longer than anticipated as the health crisis evolves, which could translate in a slow recovery of consumer confidence and therefore in lower consumption levels. Significant events such as sustained impact to the French economy as a result of the ongoing health crisis and political uncertainty tied to upcoming elections in France and other EU member states, could result in the implementation of strong protectionist measures and may affect the recovery of the Eurozone, including the French economy or lead to additional exits from the EU or the Eurozone. Furthermore, potential EU instability may have important consequences on our ability to obtain supplies from other EU countries at reasonable costs. A sustained economic downturn could cause our suppliers difficulty in accessing financing, which could lead to insolvency or general decline in the financial condition of our suppliers resulting in disruptions in our supplies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

For example, both Burger King’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were adversely affected by the terrorist attacks in Paris. Such events, even when outside of France, could dampen consumer spending 41 ----- among French consumers, reduce footfall and prevent us from operating our restaurants at peak capacity or cause disruptions to our supplies. Because a significant portion of our restaurants operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of revenue following such events harms our operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses. In addition, other developments, such as strikes, boycotts, traffic blockades, both nationally and in areas in which our restaurants operate, social and economic instability, civil disturbances, government-imposed lockdowns, or similar events, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our operations in France were most impacted by the Yellow Vests (Gilet Jaune) protests, which caused intermittent traffic blockades and transportation disruptions, particularly in downtown areas, limiting foot traffic and access to our restaurants, during the period from roughly November 2018 through early 2019.

We do not own the Burger King brand, and we are therefore highly dependent on our franchisor, BK Europe and its ultimate parent, Burger King Corporation (“BKC”). Moreover, the Master Franchise Agreement contains certain customary undertakings, and failure to reach certain restaurant opening milestones may result in fines or early termination in certain circumstances (e.g., failure to reach pre-determined new restaurant opening targets or to pay royalties when due). If the Master Franchise Agreement were terminated, all rights granted to Burger King France under the Master Franchise Agreement (including the development rights) shall terminate, and BK Europe and/or its designee may develop, open and operate, and approve third parties to develop, open and operate, Burger King restaurants in France. As a consequence, we would not be able to continue to expand our network and realize our anticipated economies of scale as a master franchisee in France, although our rights and obligations under the then existing company franchise agreements shall remain unaffected solely by reason of such termination, and that any then existing franchise agreements (whether pure franchise or with management lease) shall remain in full force and effect and we shall be able to continue receiving payments thereunder until their respective terms. The early termination of the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot control or influence the actions of our master franchisor, and our master franchisor may take actions that could harm us. For example, BK Europe may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Certain actions taken by BK Europe, including those involving the Burger King brand, may adversely affect our business operations such as BKC requiring its franchisees to adopt a product offering that we do not believe would be popular with consumers in France. Moreover, if BK Europe does not adequately protect the Burger King brand and other intellectual property rights, our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe, we are required to comply with operational programs established by our master franchisor. For example, the Master Franchise Agreement requires that our restaurants comply with specified design criteria. In addition, our master franchisor generally has the right to require us to remodel our restaurants to conform to the then-current image of Burger King, which may require the expenditure of considerable funds.

However, food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow disease”, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. New illnesses resistant to existing precautions or diseases with long incubation periods may develop in the future, such as mad cow disease, which could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Risks to the health of our customers can arise from our supply and logistics chain, which we do not control, and at our Company Restaurant and Franchise Restaurant locations. We rely on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to supply ingredients used in the preparation of the meals we sell, including sauces, meat and fresh produce. Although such third parties are subject to regulations, including food safety and environmental regulations, such regulations may not prevent such third parties from experiencing problems related to food safety and hygiene. As a result, our reliance on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. In addition, although we maintain operational controls and provide employee and franchisee training at our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants aimed at preventing food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues, we can provide no assurance that these measures will be sufficient. Any report or publicity linking us, one of our franchisees or Burger King restaurants in other countries to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect the Burger King brand, along with our revenue and profits. Outbreaks of disease, including influenza, or the continued emergence of COVID-19 variants, could reduce footfall in our restaurants. If customers were to become ill from food-borne or hygiene-related illnesses, we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants and, more significantly, the Burger King brand and reputation could be damaged, which could result in a decline in sales, thereby negatively affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, failure by any of our third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to comply with regulations, allegations of compliance failure, claims of intentional or negligent contamination of ingredients and raw materials or prolonged and intense negative publicity may disrupt their operations and result in a disruption of our food supply. Disruption of our third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners’ operations could in turn reduce or impair our supply of ingredients or other raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring at restaurants of competitors could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally. 43 ----- The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of ingredients, which could result in supply chain disruptions, significantly increasing our costs and/or lowering margins for us and our franchisees. In addition, our industry has long been subject to the threat of food tampering by suppliers, employees or guests, such as the addition of foreign objects in the food that we sell. Reports of alleged injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of restaurant chains in the QSR segment and could negatively affect us in the future as well. In addition, the QSR industry is currently under heightened journalistic, legislative and regulatory scrutiny stemming from the perception that some QSR products have contributed to widespread medical problems, such as obesity and diabetes. Compliance with consumer health laws and regulations, such as those regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items, may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if such laws and regulations change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu accordingly.

Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, lenders and other market participants are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments and consumer choices. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. We have adopted certain practices and policies to align our ESG approach with our strategy in order to deliver long-term social, environmental and economic values across our business. See “Business—ESG & Sustainability”. However, our stakeholders may look to us to implement more or different ESG procedures, standards or goals in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us, or before they make further investments in us. We may also face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. We are also subject to evolving environmental regulations, the implementation of which may be costly and timeconsuming. See “—We are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations, which could result _in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation”. As a result, we may_ be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies or such constituencies might not be satisfied with our efforts or the speed of adoption of ESG practices or polices. If we do not meet our stakeholders’ expectations or we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, trust in our brand may suffer and our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. 44 ----- These limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing such capital markets. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may also impair our ability to service our indebtedness. Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with wide-ranging ESG requirements. Concurrently with the Offering, on the Issue Date we plan to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will be a sustainability-linked financing. As a result, we will be required to maintain our sustainability targets in order to benefit from the pricing benefit associated with the sustainability-linked feature of the facility. Any failure to adhere to such targets could result in the payment of maximum amounts set forth under the terms of the financing.

Burger King France’s marketing and advertising programs must be approved by BKC, the owner of the Burger King brand. If BKC does not approve our marketing and advertising programs, we may have to develop replacement programs, which could involve additional significant costs and delay the implementation of our marketing and advertising programs. Moreover, if our marketing and advertising programs are not successful, if our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotion or if our marketing and advertising programs happen to coincide with a larger marketing and advertising program from one or more of our competitors thereby rendering our advertising program less visible or effective, we may not be able to attract new customers and retain existing customers and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our Franchise Restaurants and Company Restaurants contribute to our advertising fund based on a percentage of their gross sales. As a result, our advertising fund expenditures depend on sales volumes at system-wide restaurants. If System-wide sales decline, there will be a reduced amount available for our marketing and advertising programs. However, because of the significant financial resources of our main competitors which have larger marketing and advertising budgets than we do, we may have to maintain a certain level of marketing and advertising expenditure (notwithstanding any decline in sales) in order to compete and maintain our exposure in the market. In such circumstances, our margins may be diminished, which will have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, our margins may also be affected if the cost of mounting advertising campaigns increases.

Brand value is partly based on consumer perceptions of a variety of subjective qualities, some of which we may have limited or no control over. Isolated or repeated events that originate from us, our franchisees or suppliers, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation. For example, the Burger King brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers and distributors, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. Similarly, entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct, including alleged human rights abuses, that damages the Burger King brand or its 45 ----- reputation. Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in, or negatively affect the perception of, the Burger King brand and/or our products and decrease the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our products, which could result in lower revenue and profits.

As such, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from Franchise Restaurants. Revenue from Franchise Restaurants consists of brand royalties and rent under Franchise with Lease Management agreements, each calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales. Consequently, our results of operations depend substantially upon our franchisees’ sales volumes. Our franchisees are independent operators and, while we can mandate certain operational standards and procedures through the enforcement of our franchise agreements, we may not be able to quickly respond to franchisees that do not uphold these standards. In addition, we cannot prevent our franchisees from incurring indebtedness or conducting other businesses that could adversely affect their financial viability, nor can we control many other factors that impact the profitability of our Franchise Restaurants. Furthermore, franchisees may be less directly interested in preserving or enhancing the Burger King brand and reputation than we are. Franchisees may operate their restaurants in a manner inconsistent with our standards and requirements, such as the cleanliness, service or quality standards set forth in our franchise agreements and manuals, or standards set by governmental laws and regulations. In addition, franchisees may fail to adequately hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. While we ultimately can terminate franchisees that do not comply with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements, our brand and reputation may nonetheless suffer and our franchise business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The support of our franchisees is important for the success of our promotional activities and the strategic initiatives that we seek to undertake, and the successful execution of these initiatives will depend on our ability to maintain alignment with our franchisees. While we can generally mandate certain strategic initiatives through enforcement of our franchise agreements, we need the active support, as well as the managerial competence and, in certain cases, the financial ability, of our franchisees if the implementation of these initiatives is to be successful. In addition, our efforts to secure alignment with franchisees may result in a delay in the implementation of our promotional activities and other key initiatives if we are not able to quickly obtain franchisee commitment and support.

Leases are generally for a fixed term between nine and twelve years and feature periodic increases based on indexation clauses. In addition, market practice for leasing commercial space in certain high value areas such as central Paris requires the payment of key money to lessors and/or the former tenant. Our ability to effectively renew our existing restaurant leases or obtain restaurant leases to open new restaurants depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We may not be able to renew our existing restaurant leases on favorable terms or at all, including, for example, when the landlord is able to establish statutory grounds for non-renewal or if the leases do not have the benefit of statutory or contractual rights of renewal. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with our landlords. See “—Our business, financial condition and results of _operations have been and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics”. This renegotiation may have an impact on our future leasing transactions moving_ forward as landlords who operate in the retail space may impose higher rents or new and stringent conditions that would prevent losses like those sustained as a result of pandemic-related lease 47 ----- renegotiations. We typically occupy our restaurants under operating leases with terms of nine to twelve years. Any favorable rental rates that we are able to negotiate upon entering such leases in the years when there are high vacancy rates are not guaranteed to continue, and this may force us to pay higher rents once those leases expire or restaurants are closed in desirable locations. In addition, under French law, the maximum increases in rent imposed by law do not apply to leases with a term in excess of nine years. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, leasehold and occupancy costs represented approximately 14% of our revenue; however, as we expand our restaurant base, our lease expenses and our cash outlays for rent under the lease agreements will increase. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including: - requiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing. If an existing or future Company Restaurant or a Franchise with Lease Management Restaurant is not profitable and we decide to close it prior to expiration of the relevant lease, we would still be liable for the fulfillment of the obligations under the lease. In the event we decide to close any underperforming restaurant, we would have to renegotiate the terms of the lease agreement with the landlord for the remainder of the term of the lease and/or potentially assign or sub-lease the premises to a third-party.

The prices of many of our raw materials are affected_ by fluctuations in commodities markets, governmental agricultural policies, customs barriers, food safety warnings, the operations of suppliers, political upheavals and unforeseen events, such as severe weather conditions. We are required to source raw materials from BKC-approved suppliers. In the event of a supply disruption, a rise in commodities prices or other adverse event that affects our sources our food or logistics costs could materially increase. In addition, BKC may choose not to certify any additional suppliers that we may find in order to diversify our raw material sourcing or to replace our existing suppliers, or such certifications may take longer than anticipated to obtain. Furthermore, our existing or future suppliers may not maintain their compliance with BKC’s standards in order to maintain such certification. Certain of our restaurants may have difficulty locating suppliers that meet the certification requirements. Any difficulty in locating an adequate number of such certified suppliers could affect these restaurants’ market position which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we and our franchisees are dependent on third parties that can make frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet our specifications.

In this respect, we have to continuously monitor the productivity levels of our employees by measuring a variety of productivity indicators, such as number of tickets per working hour and sales revenue per working hour. In addition, we seek to minimize the long-term trend toward higher wages through increases in labor efficiencies; however, we may not be successful.

If we or any such third party service providers fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if any such loss of personal customer data were otherwise to occur or if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident or if our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and as a result information about our customers and employees is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately), we could be subject to liabilities and penalties, reputational damage, litigation or government enforcement actions, the incurrence of substantial costs and a loss of customer confidence, thereby adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data came into effect. The GDPR obligates EU-based companies or companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing; and (iv) rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, right of access, right to rectification, or right to erasure. In spite of our continued efforts to comply with the GDPR and similar regulations, we also face the risk that customer data that we collect may be stolen or misappropriated. Our customers may be discouraged from providing us with their data and our business could be negatively affected as a result. Under such circumstances, our regulation, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. As a data controller, we could face legal actions in the absence of compliance with GDPR. In addition, we could also face legal action in the absence of compliance of a third party processing personal data on our behalf. Given that we and/or third parties, on our behalf, process certain sensitive information, we are subject to specific processing conditions and have taken steps to ensure compliance with these conditions. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. The GDPR provides for substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to 4.0% of the annual worldwide revenue of the preceding 53 ----- financial year or €20.0 million, particularly in the event of a breach of the conditions applicable to consent and/or related to data subjects’ rights. A fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease any processing). The GDPR, the national implementing legislation, i.e., the French data protection rules and French law in general, also provide for a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements and additional private enforcement mechanisms. For instance, the French supervisory authority may issue a public warning, as part of a control revealing infringements of the applicable data protection regulation, and in parallel a public formal order to comply with the applicable regulation.

Media reports relating to any of these topics, even when not involving us, could reduce demand for our products and could result in a decrease in customer footfall in our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. In particular, with respect to social media, consumers value readily available information concerning the industry and market segments in which we operate, and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to the accuracy of such information. The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Information concerning or affecting us may be posted on such platforms at any time, including accurate and adverse information that may harm our business. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our brand or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers, could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. Our social media presence amplifies consumer engagement with our brand but comes with less control due to consumer comments and hashtags compared to more traditional public relations and marketing methods, which could associate the brand with content or views, which are not aligned with our values.

We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws and regulations may make it difficult to restructure our operations in an advantageous manner. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate may result in reassessments, interest on late payments, fines and penalties. Furthermore, we may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss carry-forwards from our entities. The actual realization of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French tax code (Code général des impôts) (the “French Tax Code”), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of taxable profit exceeding €1.0 million.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD **II”), which, inter _alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that_ its provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from January 1, 2020. The ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such new rules apply since January 1, 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

If a substantial number of franchises are not renewed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 46 ----- Further, the European Commission is currently contemplating amendments to its Regulation (EU) 330/2010, Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, (the ""VBER"") which provides parameters for businesses entering into vertical agreements and published for public consultation a draft VBER and draft revised guidelines on vertical restraints (the “Vertical Guidelines”) on July 9, 2021. The proposed amendments, provide that an exemption of Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall apply to vertical agreements, in the event competing supplier and buyer have an aggregated market share, which does not exceed 10% in the relevant market at retail level. In the event competing supplier and buyer have an aggregated market share exceeding 10% (and not above 30%), the exemption shall also apply, except for exchange of information between the parties. Such amendments, if adopted, would necessarily concern franchisors. Indeed, whilst engaging in dual distribution is not prohibited, specific attention should be given to the way a “supplier” who has set up a dual distribution system operates, in particular regarding the exchange of information with distribution partners. To address these concerns, the European Commission already proposed to make some adjustments to the existing safe harbor for dual distribution. Following the publication of the draft VBER and draft Vertical Guidelines, most of the parties expressed the view that “franchising” should be more precisely defined at the EU level and in the context of the VBER, so as to mitigate the possible effects of the contemplated amendments on informationsharing in the franchise system. The timeline for the final adoption of the revised VBER and Vertical Guidelines is now expected on June 1, 2022. In the event the amendments would pass as proposed, without further clarification, we will need to potentially modify our sharing of certain sensitive information across our network and, if necessary, pass the exemption test. Such amendments, if adopted, should be taken into consideration for our franchise network, if the latter qualifies as a dual distribution system where a “supplier” not only sells its goods or services through independent distributors (such as retailers) but also directly to end customers in direct competition with its independent distributors. In the event the market share threshold is met, adequate measures, such as Chinese walls, would need to be implemented in franchise networks, including ours, to frame the exchange of competitively sensitive information (such as prices, customers or sales volumes) with distribution partners, which are competitors on the retail level. If adopted, such amendments could create an area of legal uncertainty and require burdensome internal procedures that could be detrimental to the development of franchised brands. Such difficulties could have the impact of dissuading us or our franchisees from using our existing distribution model, which could negatively impact the size of our franchise network, and as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) (the “French Finance Law for 2020”) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD II and thus",13.3.1,"French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of interest incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.","Under Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. In addition, France has implemented the ATAD regarding in particular interest deductibility limitations and the ATAD II regarding hybrid mismatches with third countries. Pursuant to the ATAD, codified in particular under Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the 58 ----- same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount. French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group, as determined under accounting consolidation rules, to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own debt-to-equity ratio. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. The ATAD II, applicable as from January 1, 2020 (except for certain of its provisions which will be applicable as from January 1, 2022) and codified under Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises”, except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established and the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” (i.e., entities holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its 59 ----- voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit) are established, qualify the entity as nontransparent. Where such a hybrid entity is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax at its own level or taxable pursuant to Article 8 of the French Tax Code at the level of its partners or shareholders, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and may thus increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses.

More recently, in a communication to the European Parliament and the Council of May 18, 2021 and denominated “Business Taxation for the 21[st] Century”, the European Commission has announced additional measures in the field of corporate taxation to take into account the evolution of the context of the EU business taxation policy. In particular, the European Commission announced that it will propose a new framework for income taxation for businesses in Europe (“Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) that will replace the pending proposals under the CCCTB. BEFIT will be a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU and will 57 ----- consist in consolidating the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to Member States using a formula and be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and will give rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes, (ii) adopt a recommendation on the domestic treatment of losses and (iii) make a legislative proposal creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”). Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Our tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties (including legal counsel), and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

We also present average restaurant sales (“ARS”) and System-wide sales (“SWS”), neither of which are not identified as accounting measures in the framework of IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable with those presented by other groups. With reference to the interpretation of these APMs: - APMs are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and are not audited; - these measures are calculated solely on the basis of the historical data of the SSN Issuer; - the APMs must not be considered as substitutes for the indicators provided for under IFRS; - APMs are not indicative of our future performance; and - since APMs are determined on a basis which is not regulated by IFRS, the criteria applied for the relative determination of APMs, as well as the definition and calculation of APMs presented in this Listing Prospectus may not be homogenous with the criteria adopted by other groups and therefore, APMs presented in this Listing Prospectus may not be comparable with similarly titled APMs presented by other groups.

Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection, estimate or guarantee of performance regarding Adjusted EBITDA generation for the year ending December 31, 2021 which may be affected by definitive closures of Quick restaurants, the phasing of the novelty effect and the pace of conversions (including temporary closures for conversion). Moreover, prospective investors should note that the additional Adjusted EBITDA modeled by Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for new restaurant openings and conversions may be offset, to a degree that will vary on the circumstances, by a number of factors. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to: - the impact of the novelty effect for new Burger King restaurants discussed under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Evolution of our network”_ and whether this has been sufficiently accounted for in our assumptions; - estimates and assumptions regarding demand by customers visiting our increased number of restaurants; and - assumptions regarding the absence of increases in our fixed costs resulting from the operation of additional Company Restaurants during such period. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and the underlying calculations have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is included in this Listing Prospectus because we believe that it provides a useful indication of what our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 would have been under certain circumstances and assumptions as described herein; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS, and you should not consider Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we have used to calculate Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA are reasonable and are based either on historical experience and our knowledge of the marketplace, investors should not place undue reliance upon any of these calculations, as underlying estimates and assumptions could differ from what would have been our actual results of operations if all Burger King restaurants in operation or under conversion as of August 31, 2021 had been operational for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021. In addition, our results of operations that are ultimately achieved with the conversion in accordance with our strategy could differ from the model of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA presented herein.

The holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indentures) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Under French law the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person and such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the PIK Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the SSN Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (the “Principal Obligations”). Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on parallel debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 _Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt claim. There is no certainty that the parallel debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the parallel debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indentures that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of 1[st] July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the SSN Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the SSN Collateral only at the direction of the “instructing group”. Subject to certain exceptions described below and in further detail in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” among other things, the “majority pari passu creditors” (generally, creditors representing the simple majority of, among other things, the outstanding principal amount under the Senior Secured Notes and any pari passu secured indebtedness) shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the right to instruct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the SSN Collateral, provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. If, however: - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, in each case, within three months of the date on which an instructing group delivers a copy of their proposed enforcement instructions (the “initial notice”); or - the “super senior discharge date” (as described in the section below entitled “Description _of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) has not occurred within six_ months of the date of the initial notice; or - an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a member of the Group; or - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making a determination, and the “majority super senior creditors” (as described below): (a) determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realization proceeds of any enforcement; and (b) deliver enforcement instructions they believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles before the Security Agent has received instructions from the majority pari passu creditors; then the Security Agent shall, instead follow the instructions that are subsequently given by the “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing more than 66.67% of the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain hedging liabilities), provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in a number of respects. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and creditors under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the relevant hedging obligations or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the SSN Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or may 69 ----- be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any SSN Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the cash recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations or the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement actions against the SSN Issuer or its subsidiaries, the SSN Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain SSN Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which may be secured by security interests in the SSN Collateral, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not constitute the requisite majority of pari passu creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent.

In France, the enforcement of the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured over such SSN Collateral, as applicable, under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such a SSN Guarantee or security interest in the SSN Collateral is not in the grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such guarantee or security interest would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In France, the liabilities and obligations under the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce or infringement of the provisions of Articles L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Code de Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the_ offering of the Senior Secured Notes which the Issuers have applied for the direct benefit of each French Guarantor through intercompany loans. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations under the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or a French SSN Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the SSN Guarantee and the security interest in the SSN Collateral. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the 70 ----- guarantee must be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) in connection with a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of non-judicial private attribution (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of attribution (whether judicial attribution or private attribution), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or court appointed expert in the context of a private attribution. In any event, if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the pledged assets and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. Consequently, in the event that the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the holders of the Notes are entitled to, and decide to, enforce the Collateral, as the case may be, which consists of a pledge over the shares of each Issuer, through judicial or private foreclosure, and the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the holders of the Notes may be required to pay immediately to the relevant pledgors a “soulte” equal to the amount by which the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt. If the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such shares, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured. Alternatively, the holders of the Notes could decide to undertake the sale of the pledged shares by public auction. As public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the group as a going concern.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The SSN Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. In addition, the PIK Indenture allows the incurrence of certain additional permitted debt that is secured by the PIK Collateral, and the SSN Collateral may also secure additional debt to 71 ----- the extent permitted by the terms of the SSN Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Not all of the respective Issuers’ assets will secure, directly or indirectly, the Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the French economy and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all of the obligations of the entity must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of France. The security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Issuers cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Issuers also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

If a change of control were to occur, there can be no assurance that the Issuers would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or, in the case of the SSN Issuer, that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the SSN Issuer's other contractual obligations would allow the SSN Issuer to make such required purchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that the Issuers have incurred or may incur in the future. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under any indebtedness that the Issuers have incurred or may incur in the future (including, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility), even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from their subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by the Group's then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuers’ subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, the Issuers’ subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to fund the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, the Issuers expect that they would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. There can be no assurance that the Issuers would be able to obtain such financing. The Issuers’ failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the respective Indentures, which could, in turn, constitute a default under certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes— _Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” and “Description of the PIK Notes— Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control”._ 74 ----- The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar refinancings involving the Issuer that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indentures. Except as described under “Description of _the Senior Secured Notes—Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” and_ “Description of the PIK Notes—Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control”, the Indentures will not contain provisions that would require the Issuers to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar refinancing. The definition of “change of control” in the Indentures will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of each Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular refinancing would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of each of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Moreover, even though the Security Agent can, on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes, enforce the pledge of the SSN Issuer’s receivables under the BH Cash Management Agreement, thereby giving it a direct claim against BH on behalf of the holders of Senior Secured Notes, its ability to enforce this direct claim would be similarly adversely affected under such circumstances. Therefore, if BH were to become subject to insolvency proceedings, the SSN Issuer’s ability to access the cash and other property held by BH on our behalf may be legally blocked, and the amount of such cash and other property may be significant.

The Senior Secured Notes will bear a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (""EURIBOR""), plus an applicable margin, and the New Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable rate based on the EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes. Neither the SSN Indenture nor the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. The European Money Markets Institute (“EMMI”, the administrator of EURIBOR) announced in 2020 that measures needed to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform EURIBOR to ensure continued publication and compliance with E.U. Benchmarks Regulation, such regulation having been implemented into EU law in order to address perceived weaknesses in the admininstration of benchmarks and entering into force on June 30, 2016 (subject to certain transitional provisions). EMMI has subsequently confirmed that it is compliant with the E.U. Benchmarks Regulation. However, there can be no guarantee that subsequent changes in regulatory guidance, industry standards or market practice could result in further changes to way in which EURIBOR, LIBOR or EURIBOR replacement 78 ----- rates or mechanisms or other risk-free rates are drafted, implemented or interpreted. In addition, the potential elimination of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or other benchmarks are determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Secured Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility). Any such change could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements to fix a portion of these interest rates, there can be no assurance that any such current or future hedging arrangements will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of interest rate fluctuations or will not result in losses or that our risk management practices and procedures will operate successfully.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which the Issuers have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time.

Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. 79 ----- The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with France. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France. In addition, the enforcement in France of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are Burger King France, resolutely focused on the expansion of the world’s second largest QSHR chain in the French market which is characterized by secular, long-term demand for eating out and a strong affinity for our brand. Guided by the Burger King philosophy of “Have it your way”, we offer customers a differentiated eating experience, combining high-quality food, such as our flame-grilled hamburgers, with attractive restaurant locations. In 2013, our principal shareholder Groupe Bertrand reintroduced the Burger King brand to the French market after a 15-year absence, by signing of an exclusive master franchise agreement between Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. Groupe Bertrand is a leader in the French restaurant industry, known for its ability to roll out and transform restaurant concepts. Following our acquisition in 2015 of Financière Quick Group, an incumbent QSHR operator with nearly 400 prime restaurant locations in France, we demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of our Burger King network in France, both through the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, as well as through new Burger King restaurant openings. As of June 30, 2021, we operated 412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion) and as of August 31, 2021, we operated 413 restaurants under the Burger King brand (425 restaurants including nine restaurants under the Quick brand to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and three Quick restaurants under conversion). Our mission is to continue to deliver a high-quality service to our customers and support the growth of our franchisees through expansion of new Burger King restaurants. We are committed to strict development criteria, prioritizing sustainable initiatives and seeking to exploit economies of scale to further growing our EBITDA. Our business model features a mix of predominantly Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants and Pure Franchise Restaurants, and to a lesser extent Company Restaurants. We believe this model enables us to manage our growth flexibly while controlling the locations of the restaurants in our network. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 83% of our Burger King restaurants are Franchise Restaurants under our Burger King brand and the remaining 17% are Company Restaurants, a balance that supports our gross margin and reduces our capital expenditure requirement for expansion. As of June 30, 2021, we were the direct lessee for or owner of approximately 87% of the restaurant locations in our network, compared to 85% of the restaurant locations in our network as of December 31, 2018. 90 ----- In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. The strong recognition of the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide, serves as a solid base to attract customers and prospective franchisees. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) for Burger King restaurants was approximately €2.8 million. We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with locations throughout the country and approximately 15% market share by sales of burgers in 2021 (up from 8% in 2017), generating €1,056.7 million in SWS, €448.3 million in revenue (reported) and €151.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA (reported) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, with 412 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 (399 of which were under the Burger King brand).",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

For a further discussion of changes in accounting methods that have occurred, see note 3.2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Listing Prospectus. _IFRS 16 — leases_ IFRS 16 (Leases), which the IASB published on January 13, 2016 and which became mandatory for companies reporting according to IFRS from January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases, and requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Under this new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease payments, are recognized. Short-term leases and low-value leases are exempted. The new standard affects certain commonly used financial ratios and performance metrics because of its impact on the balance sheet and on the nature of expenses related to leases, as rent expenses are substantially replaced with depreciation and finance costs. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognize assets corresponding to the right to use the underlying leased asset for the estimated term of the lease, as well as liabilities corresponding to the discounted obligation to make lease payments for substantially all leases. Operating lease expense in the consolidated income statement is replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset, presented in depreciation and amortization (restaurants) and depreciation and amortization (corporate center), and interest expense on the financial liability, presented in other financial expenses. Regarding the statement of cash flows, the financing cash flows are impacted by the repayment of the debt and interest expenses. The new lease accounting rules under IFRS 16 primarily affect the accounting for our operating leases. Our principal leased assets include our stores, offices, data storage and vehicles. Previously, each lease contract was qualified under the roles of IAS 17 as either a finance lease or as an operating lease, with accounting treatment appropriate for each category. We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. In the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we applied the modified retrospective transition approach and without restatement for the comparative information for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the discount rates we applied as of the transition date are based on the Group's marginal borrowing rate. These discount rates are determined with respect to the remaining terms of leases from the date of first-time application on January 1, 2019. Unless otherwise indicated, the period-to-period comparison of our results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial _Condition and Results of Operations”, are on a pre-IFRS 16 basis._ However, in order to provide prospective investors with the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance, we have prepared reconciliations from our reported results of operations and cash flows as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the six months ended June 30, 2020, the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019 to the restated figures for such periods, including IFRS 16 adjustments and other adjustments, is set forth under the section titled ""—Reconciliations of our results of operations — Impact of the _application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC), IFRS 5 and D&A related to assets held for sale "" and “—_ Reconciliations of our cash flows — Impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC)_ ”. 93 ----- _IFRS IC conclusion for IFRS 16_ On December 16, 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee published its decision on (i) determining the enforceable period of an automatically renewable lease or a lease that can be terminated by either of the parties with no contractual penalty and (ii) the link between the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements and the IFRS 16 lease term. This decision provides clarifications that may impact the term of leases other than the particular cases mentioned. In light of this decision, on July 3, 2020, the French accounting standards authority (Autorité _des Normes Comptables, or the “ANC”) issued a new position statement on July 3, 2020 regarding the_ application of IFRS 16 on French commercial leases that are described as “3-6-9” leases, because such leases are signed for at least nine years, with unilateral termination possible by the tenant after three or six years. This statement superseded the ANC’s previous position statement of February 16, 2018. Subsequent to the issuance of such position statement, we performed a further analysis of our leases in order to identify contracts whose initial accounting under IFRS 16 could be affected by the ANC’s position statement. As a result of this further analysis, the Group revised its accounting treatment of certain lease contracts to reflect an increased estimated term for certain leases. Our analysis focused on the underlying asset leases (restaurants) including inseparable fixtures and installations, of which the residual net book value at the end of the estimated lease period pursuant to the IFRS 16 standard may constitute a significant penalty (within the meaning of the decision of the IFRS Interpretations Committee) for the Group. The revised accounting treatment of such leases were retrospectively recognized at the date of transition to IFRS 16 (January 1, 2019), which resulted in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Unless otherwise indicated, the period-to-period comparison of our results of operations for all periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,_ are on a pre-IFRS 16 basis, and therefore do not reflect the application of the decision of the IFRS Interpretations Committee.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.1,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"As a food service provider with hundreds of restaurant locations, we have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the various health protection measures that have been adopted by the French government. These measures include government-mandated shutdowns of restaurants, country-wide lockdowns and mandatory safety measures across all our operations in France. As a result, we have been required to manage the numbers of customers in our restaurants, reduce or temporarily close the operation of certain of our restaurants following evolving guidelines or orders by the French government, invest in protective and other safety equipment and increase our reliance on home delivery and Click & Collect purchase options. For example, as a result of the first lockdown in France, a large majority of our restaurants were shut down from March 17, 2020 through the end of April 2020, after which we underwent, and are still undergoing, a period of gradual and progressive reopening of all our restaurants. In response to these government restrictions that limited our operations, we adopted various measures to strengthen our liquidity position, including by drawing in full our Existing Revolving Credit Facility for a total of €60 million and entering into the state-guaranteed PGE Loan (contrat de prêts _garantis par l’État français) for a total of €80 million. Once the PGE Loan was secured, we used our_ 94 ----- cash available to repay €40 million of the amounts we borrowed under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, from the period beginning on March 19, 2020 through the end of May 2020, we placed most of our staff, both at our restaurants and in our headquarters, under temporarily unemployment. We also ceased most external service expenditures such as cleaning, security and maintenance, both in our restaurants and at our headquarters, and renegotiated our rental obligations for the period with our landlords. In addition, we implemented temporary royalty adjustments to support our franchisees, which resulted in a reduction in the revenue we generated from our franchisees during the first half of 2020. A breakdown of our quarterly cash flow generation (including our discontinued activity) for the periods impacted by COVID-19, beginning on January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, is set forth below: During the periods presented above, we experienced negative working capital following the COVID-19 crisis as a result of payments to landlords, delayed suppliers' liabilities and a decrease in receivables. However, we experienced a working capital inflow in the three months ended June 30, 2021 as a result of a decrease in trade receivables on our CPI activity (as defined below) and an increase in our financial liabilities driven by VAT. As a result of the various measured adopted by the government to curb the spread of COVID19, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were materially impacted. While we have recorded continued positive performance in the six months ended June 30, 2021, government measures in response to the evolving pandemic continue to be uncertain. As a result, the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of evolving government containment efforts, all of which are beyond our knowledge and control.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.2,"Consumer preferences and societal trends, general economic conditions and consumer sentiment","We operate in the QSHR category of the QSR segment and our results of operations during the periods under review have been, and in the future may continue to be, affected by changes in consumer preferences and societal trends. Among the most significant trends that have affected our results of operations is the increased prevalence of eating away from home as the habits of the French population begins to exhibit greater convergence with other Northern European countries. As a result, the restaurant industry has grown in line with this increase in out-of-home dining. Demographic, social and economic trends underlying this decline include profound shifts in the way people live, work and eat in recent decades that have accelerated with economic and technological changes. More people are living alone, which means that people are eating out alone, stopping to eat while in transit or getting together to eat outside the home as a social activity. In addition, more French households with children have dual incomes, meaning both parents are working and more likely to be on the go during the week and pressed for time on the weekends. Moreover, more French young people are working while 95 ----- pursuing their studies and therefore have comparatively more spending power than prior generations. These demographic, social and economic changes support the QSR segment, and in particular the QSHR market within the QSR segment, as the price points are accessible, customer service delivery is geared towards efficiency and the portion sizes can be generous. According to GIRA Foodservice, during the periods under review, the QSR market grew at a CAGR of 6.8% per annum between 2017 and 2019, although it decreased in 2020 by 31.2% compared to 2019 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite the temporary slowdown in the growth of the QSR market during the COVID-19 outbreak, the QSR market significantly outperformed the broader OOH market during such periods, with the QSR segment generating approximately €13.4 billion in sales in 2020, representing a decline of approximately 31.2% as compared to 2019; whereas the French OOH market overall declined by 37.7% during the same period. According to NPD Group, the QSR market also increased its share of the OOH market from 35% in 2017 to 44% in 2020, reaching 62% for the three months ended March 30, 2021. In particular, during the same periods, the QSHR market grew at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2017 and 2019, decreasing only by 22% compared to 2019 due to COVID-19 impacts. Its share in the QSR market increased from 33% in 2017 to 38% in the first quarter of 2021. See “Industry”. Additionally, we believe that these societal trends contributed to increase footfall which had a positive impact on our results of operations, during the pre-COVID-19 periods under review. Our results of operations are also influenced by changes in consumer preferences and trends regarding taste, packaging, ordering and customer service. To the extent we are able to maintain a fresh brand image and good reputation among consumers for products that appeal to them, our results of operations will be positively affected. Conversely, if we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to such changes by evolving our product offering, menu customization options, portion sizing, pricing and other aspects of our business operations adequately and in a timely fashion, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We are constantly seeking to stay at the vanguard of consumer preferences through product offering and customer service, and have begun initiatives to better satisfy customer needs, for example through the improvements to the Burger King mobile app, which facilitate the ordering of Click & Collect options, as well as integrate our customer loyalty program. In addition, our results of operations are also affected to a degree by global economic conditions and specific local economic conditions in the markets and geographic areas in which we operate. Such conditions include levels of employment, disposable income, consumer confidence and consumer willingness to spend, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including gross domestic product and interest and inflation rates. During the periods under review, our results of operations were affected by the state of the French economy. According to INSEE, France's GDP grew at only 1.9% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019, followed by a significant drop of 7.9% in 2020, which is mainly attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During periods of economic growth, consumers tend to eat outside the home more frequently, young people (an important demographic for the QSHR sector), tend to have more disposable income and consumers generally tend to travel more often for work or leisure, all of which can lead to greater traffic in our restaurants and contribute to System-wide sales (""SWS"") generation. Conversely, during periods with unfavorable economic conditions characterized by stagnant or negative GDP growth and/or a decrease in disposable income, consumers may reduce the frequency with which they dine out or choose more inexpensive restaurants when dining away from home. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, therefore, can reduce customer traffic, as consumers may prefer to prepare food at home, or comparison shop for the best promotional deals from restaurants, which can reduce our total sales. Nevertheless, we believe that our positioning in the QSR segment with good value-for-money products mitigates the impact of potential changes in general and local economic conditions as this sector has historically been relatively resilient. In addition, customer traffic is a product of, among other things, consumer sentiment which can be affected by significant global or national events. Large-scale sporting or cultural events can encourage additional travel to certain regions by domestic and international tourists, which can drive traffic at certain restaurant locations where the event is held or on routes to such locations. Conversely, events such as terrorist attacks or civil disturbances such as prolonged labor strikes can negatively affect our results of operations and discourage customers from dining out, particularly if transportation networks are disrupted. For example, our operations in France were most impacted by the Yellow Vests (Gilet Jaune) protests, which caused intermittent traffic blockades and transportation disruptions, particularly in downtown areas, limiting foot traffic and access to our restaurants, during the period from 96 ----- roughly November 2018 through early 2019. Following these protests, consumers may have been less likely to patronize our restaurants in and around the affected areas or in urban centers generally which partially offset increased sales recorded by our restaurants during the same period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.3,Evolution of our network,"One of the drivers of our results of operations is the size and evolution of our restaurant network. Our historical strategy of converting existing Quick restaurants into the Burger King brand permitted the Group to accelerate its development of the Burger King brand in France. Additionally, we opened new restaurants during the period under review as we sought to continue to expand our nationwide coverage. As a result, our network of Burger King restaurants expanded from 203 as of December 31, 2017 to 399 as of June 30, 2021. Concurrently, the number of Quick restaurants operated by the Group in mainland France during the period under review decreased from 252 as of December 31, 2017 (excluding four restaurants temporarily closed and under conversion to the Burger King brand) to 110 as of June 30, 2021 (excluding two restaurants temporarily closed and under conversion to the Burger King brand) due to closures and conversions to the Burger King brand. The recent disposal of our Quick operations (see ""Summary—Recent Developments"") will allow us to further focus on the expansion of the Burger King brand in France. Our results and our margins are also affected by the evolution of the mix between Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants in our network. Company Restaurants add additional costs to our structure, such as personnel costs and lease costs that we cannot ultimately recuperate from our Franchise Restaurants (as is the case with our Franchise with Lease Management restaurants), generally resulting in a lower margin of SWS when compared to Franchise Restaurants. In addition, we generally incur capital expenditures and pre-opening costs with each new Company Restaurant, whereas due to franchise arrangements, the cash flow impact on the Group for adding a new Franchise Restaurant is more limited and the sales and margin impact may be significant. Additionally, the cost of converting a Franchise Restaurant is also more limited in terms of investment than opening a Company Restaurant, though the return in terms of additional royalties is significant. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 we opened 25, 25, 21 and 17 restaurants, respectively, of which seven, three, one and none were Company Restaurants. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, we converted 63, 29, nine and 15 restaurants, respectively, of which 16, six, four and one were Company Restaurants. We generally record pre-opening costs corresponding to wages prior to trading, training and pre-IFRS16 rent. During years with a high number of Company Restaurant openings, such costs may be unevenly distributed and disproportionally recorded during certain quarters before the sales uplift is experienced. This necessary network growth may affect certain cost items in our consolidated income statement as well as our cash flow related to investing activities in our consolidated cash flow statement. We expect this opening effect to continue to be recorded, though the mix of Company Restaurants opened will likely diminish over time as network expansion stabilizes. See also “—Key Performance Indicators—Number of restaurants” below for a discussion of restaurant openings and closings. In addition, QSHR restaurant locations generally require a certain level of renovation and refurbishment every six to seven years in order to maintain customer traffic. As almost 50% of our Burger King restaurants have opened or have been converted from former Quick restaurants within the last three years, renovation and refurbishment expenses have mostly stemmed from our operation of Quick branded restaurants. Furthermore, the works undertaken as part of the conversion process from Quick branded restaurants to the Burger King brand are sufficient to restart the refurbishment cycle for such restaurants. The following discusses the main trends discernable when examining the evolution of our network during the periods under review that affected our results of operations. 97 ----- The “novelty effect”, which we use to describe the strong sales performance experienced by newly-opened and converted Burger King restaurants, records ARS in their first few months of operations that are significantly higher than the monthly ARS of the entire Burger King network for the full year. We believe the novelty effect results from the strong brand equity that Burger King enjoys in the French market as a relatively newly-arrived challenger in a market long dominated by McDonald’s. Also contributing to this effect is Burger King’s strong value proposition characterized by good quality ingredients and great taste at accessible prices, which resonates with customers. As a result, Burger King restaurants register minimal ramp up time as the first month’s ARS typically exceeds that of the entire Group perimeter. Factors that can affect the intensity and duration of the novelty effect include, among other things: - the number of Burger King restaurants in the catchment area (generally the novelty effect is more pronounced for the first restaurant); - the distance to competitor’s restaurants; - the demographics of the catchment area; and - the characteristics of the restaurant (i.e., city center, suburban area, shopping mall or drive-through location). The higher ARS generated by Burger King restaurants as compared to Quick restaurants recorded during the periods under review is largely attributable to higher customer traffic. As a result, by increasing the number of Burger King restaurants in the network, through both organic expansion and the conversion of Quick restaurants, our revenues generated directly by Company Restaurants, and indirectly from Franchise Restaurant through royalties and lease payments, increased. As we have progressed in our conversion efforts, the weight of pre-existing Burger King restaurants has increased in our calculation of ARS, and due to the waning of the novelty effect as to those restaurants, the ARS for our Burger King restaurants as a whole may slightly decrease, as it did for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year prior. The pace of the growth of our network has depended, and in the future will likely depend, on a combination of factors, including, among other things, the prioritization of certain clusters to achieve better network density in the Burger King restaurant network and decreased logistics costs, receipt of necessary permits and landlord consents, securing financing in the case of franchisees (as applicable) and discussions with franchisees. As a result, the restaurants opened or converted during the periods under review represent a mix of locations, categories and sizes, thereby producing non-uniform effects on our results of operations depending on the circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.4,Franchise arrangements and franchisee performance,"We are the master franchisee of Burger King in France and the former franchisor for Quick, and royalties, entry fees and lease payments from lease management arrangements have contributed significantly to our results of operations during the periods under review. Our franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who remunerate us by paying one-off entry fees upon the opening or conversion of their restaurants and through the payment of a certain percentage of their sales as brand royalties (part of which we in turn pay to BK Europe for those restaurants operated under the Burger King brand). Moreover, for Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, which represent the majority of our Franchise Restaurants, we also receive lease payments as a percentage of sales. As a result of our franchise arrangements, our results of operations and our profitability are significantly affected in a positive way when Burger King’s ARS is performing well. We generally prefer to use franchises as we believe that our franchisees’ overall expertise at running restaurants results in better performance. 98 ----- During the periods under review, our franchisor network grew in line with the further development of the Burger King network through both the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand as franchise restaurants, as well as organic new franchise restaurant openings. In line with our strategy, most such franchises were opened under our Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants arrangement.

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.5,Cost base,"Our cost base is comprised of a mixture of variable, semi-variable and fixed costs. Variable costs primarily include food and logistics costs and selling costs. Operating and occupancy costs (including rental expenses), as well as general & administrative expenses are mainly fixed costs, while personnel costs have both a fixed and semi-variable component. Personnel costs related to staff in Company Restaurants are semi-variable whereas personnel costs in connection with headquarters and Company Restaurants’ management is generally fixed. In the event of a decrease in SWS, we may not be able to reduce our cost base in a timely manner, in particular as it relates to our fixed costs, which could adversely impact our margins. However, in the event of an increase in SWS, we benefit from a strong operational leverage as SWS growth allows favorable scale effects. The following sections discuss the main factors affecting the principal items of our cost base. _Food and logistics costs_ Beginning on March 31, 2019, Franchise Restaurants under both the Burger King brand and the Quick brand are responsible for their own food and logistics costs as Burger King’s model is based on the outsourcing of food purchases and logistics services. Prior to March 31, 2019, food purchases and logistics services for Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand were managed through a dedicated Group subsidiary. However, for Company Restaurants under both Burger King and Quick brands, we source a wide range of ingredients, including beef and chicken, potatoes and other fresh and frozen products, and a variety of sauces to form our menu and we also incur logistics costs to store inventory and transport raw materials and semi-finished products to such restaurant locations. Our food and logistics costs for Company Restaurants were €91.3 million, €54.3 million and €58.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, representing 15.5%, 13.0% and 11.4% of our total sales and franchise revenues for the same periods, respectively. As we are the master franchisee of BK Europe for France, we must use approved packaging and source from approved suppliers with plants that have passed inspection by BKC or its affiliates. During the periods under review, we have developed a significant French network of approved suppliers, which has helped to control our logistics costs as a percentage of revenues as we no longer need to heavily rely on imports of raw materials and semi-finished goods from approved suppliers in neighboring European countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria. In addition, many of the ingredients we use in preparing our food are commodities and are subject to price volatility, notably beef. We purchase all of our beef from suppliers that are strictly required to purchase beef only from the European Union, with a limited number of countries of origin (France, Germany and Austria). More than 50% of our beef comes from France. European beef prices are driven by the interplay of supply and demand dynamics. During the periods under review, prices for European beef were on an upward trend. We seek to optimize spending on ingredients, reduce our exposure to price fluctuations and contain logistics costs through a variety of measures, including regular review of our supply contracts, maintain contacts with multiple suppliers, focusing our cost control measures on prevention of food 99 ----- waste and actively planning our network growth in clusters to reduce logistics costs. Examples of cost control initiatives or events during the periods under review include: (i) use of futures and hedging on certain raw materials purchased from our suppliers; (ii) further development and growth of a BKC-approved supplier network in France, which allows us to obtain better pricing and reduce logistics costs; (iii) secured sourcing plans in France and Europe; and (iv) supplier contingency plans, both with respect to the number of suppliers in France and the expansion of our supplier network in other countries. We expect food and logistics costs to decrease as the network grows and becomes more dense. Enhanced buying power owing to the growth of our network has helped, and potentially in the future can help, us to attain high standards of product quality and more competitive pricing. These factors can have positive effects on our customer proposition and the profit margins of our Company Restaurants, though we expect that they will not affect our franchise revenues since our royalties and lease payments are calculated as a percentage of their sales. An ancillary benefit of our cost reduction initiatives is that franchisees may have greater financial means to invest more quickly in a second or third Burger King restaurant. The effectiveness of our supply and logistics chain can also impact our costs of sales and administration expenses. See “Business—Group Operations—Procurement and logistics—Raw materials supply” for more information. _Leasehold and occupancy costs_ We currently rent almost all of our Company Restaurants and our Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants through commercial or ground leases. We are the tenant of record for both types of restaurants, though pursuant to our Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, the franchisee pays us a percentage of sales for rent, generally with a fixed minimum. Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, discussed in more detail under “—Franchise arrangements and franchisee _performance” require us to be liable for the rent payment. However, not only do they provide us with_ control over the real estate, but the percentage of sales paid by the franchisee compensates us for our ownership and management of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and covers the underlying leasehold costs. Due to the strong ARS generated by the Burger King brand, as the ratio of Burger King restaurants to Quick restaurants has increased during the periods under review, our leasehold costs have improved as a percentage of revenues. Further, during the periods under review, in each conversion of a Quick Franchise Restaurant with Lease Management, the rent remained the same for the existing leasehold while the ARS improved significantly, thereby yielding higher lease payments from the franchisees, which contributed to our gross margin. Our leasehold and occupancy costs for restaurants were €67.2 million, €66.1 million and €68.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, representing approximately 11%, 16% and 14% of our revenues for the same periods, respectively. Commercial leases generally have a term of nine years, typically with early termination options for the tenant every three years and an automatic renewal right for the tenant at the end of the term. Since mid-2019, we have entered into several lease agreements with longer terms of up to twelve years for some of our new Burger King restaurant openings. Ground leases (usually related to freestanding restaurants with their own parking spaces and grounds) typically have a longer term of 30 years. Our leases generally contain an annual increase pursuant to an indexation clause that is based on, among other things, inflation. Increases in our leasehold and occupancy costs occur when we open new Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants. Opening new restaurants also has the effect of increasing restaurant overhead more broadly with additional rent, fixtures, insurance and other costs. Certain restaurant locations, particularly in transportation locations and at large shopping malls, may have a variable rent set at a percentage of sales, typically with a certain minimum rent. See “Business—Real Estate”. To manage leasehold and occupancy costs, we focus on site selection, the right-sizing of the restaurant, and the negotiation of leases that are realistic in terms of the sales that such location can generate. In this process, we are informed by the data from our other restaurants and we are guided by 100 ----- conservative guidelines for rent as a percentage of sales. In connection with the conversion of Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants, we are committed to securing the lease agreement with the landlord prior to the conversion when the conversion is planned to take place at the end of the lease period. We are also leveraging Groupe Bertrand’s long history and know-how in site selection in order to reduce costs. See “Business—Our Network—Site selection”. As the Burger King network expanded during the period under review, leasehold and occupancy costs were better absorbed as a percentage of revenues. In connection with the continued development of the Burger King brand in France, we have decided to enter into Franchise with Lease Management agreements with our franchisees going forward. We expect that occupancy costs will rise in the aggregate but decline as a percentage of revenues as Franchise with Lease Management locations take on a larger proportion of our franchise arrangements. We believe this will result from the fact that lease payments under Franchise with Lease Management arrangements will more than compensate for the higher leasehold and occupancy cost base. _Labor costs_ In addition to the cost of our headquarters staff and management, we hire employees (whom we refer to as “team members”) directly for our Company Restaurants, while franchisees are responsible for their own labor costs. Labor costs primarily comprise the salaries of team members employed in individual restaurants plus managers and restaurant directors. The QSHR category is labor-intensive, which is compounded by the fact that pursuant to French law and the applicable collective bargaining agreements for the fast food sector, our ability to make use of part-time work and require overtime is limited to certain prescribed thresholds. Though labor costs are largely fixed, restaurants directors and managers receive a variable component of their compensation based on ARS and other performance indicators such as profitability and respect of brand standards (e.g., quality and service). During the periods under review, as the Burger King network was expanding, we regularly made new hires for new Company Restaurants and for our general & administrative structure to gear for growth, and our results of operations reflect the integration of such employees into our cost structure. Additionally, a portion of pre-opening costs generally includes employee wages as staff must complete training prior to the opening of the relevant Company Restaurant. The QSR segment generally has a high turnover among team members, which can increase training costs and reduce productivity, but gives us some flexibility to adapt the staffing level to the level of sales through attrition when sales decrease. Our Company Restaurants’ labor costs were €100.8 million, €62.7 million and €61.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, representing 17.2%, 15.0% and 12.1% of our total sales and franchise revenues for the same periods, respectively. We seek to manage labor costs based on right sizing the staff for each Company Restaurant according to restaurant size and the expected footfall informed by similarly situated restaurants. We also focus a portion of our new restaurant development efforts on originating drive-through locations which tend to be more efficient from a labor-cost point of view because of the higher traffic that easily absorbs the additional staff cost. Moreover, we have been investing in point-of-sale and cooking equipment systems that seek to efficiently manage order, preparation and dispatch flow in the front of the house and kitchen. For new restaurant openings, applicable collective bargaining agreements for the fast food sector allow us to use short-term contracts and part-time work, which helps us to accommodate the higher footfall trends during the novelty effect period and also ensure the correct staffing level for the particular restaurant. We also manage team members on short-term contracts by attrition, given the high turnover in the QSR segment. We focus on internal promotion of restaurant managers from the ranks of team members.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The success of new burgers is attributable to a variety of factors, including the attractiveness and taste of the product, suitability of the product to changing consumer preferences, perceived product quality and competition from other comparable products launched by our 101 ----- competitors. Launch of a successful new product or an in-demand limited time offer can result in a sales uplift by encouraging additional orders from our customers. Conversely, a lack of new product offerings, an unsuccessful product or an incomplete roll-out of a new product can decrease sales if customers are not satisfied. Examples of new products during the period under review are the launch of gourmet burgers with premium ingredients, plant-based burger options and additional healthy menu items such as fresh bowls. Brand equity is another factor that can affect results of operations for operators in the QSR segment. Positive associations regarding product quality, service, and value for money, among other factors, can help consumers make a decision regarding which QSHR restaurant to patronize. The Burger King brand was re-introduced in France in 2012 following a 15-year absence. In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands (increasing our position by 6 percentage points as compared to the same survey in 2018). We believe that the following characteristics differentiate Burger King in the market place and help enhance our market position, which contributed to our results of operations during the periods under review: (i) flame-grilled patties; (ii) customization under the “Have it Your Way” slogan; (iii) fresh ingredients; (iv) generous portion sizes; and (v) healthy dining options. During the periods under review, as the network of Burger King restaurants expanded, brand awareness increased and accelerated through word-of-mouth and the Group’s advertising campaigns on various media. The development in France of the Burger King brand, a brand with worldwide currency and a strong challenger positioning to McDonald’s in many other jurisdictions, has resulted in increasing awareness of the Burger King brand in France, which has helped to enhance ARS for Burger King locations and was a significant contributor to our revenues during the years periods under review.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Franchisees under the Burger King brand and the Quick brands contribute 3.5% of their sales and between 4.5% and 5.0% of their sales, respectively, to a marketing budget to which we also contribute the same percentage from our Company Restaurants sales. We then work with advertising agencies to plan and execute campaigns that resonate with our target audiences. During the periods under review, we opted for a strong digital presence, producing “viral” video clips targeted to young people that were widely shared on social media, amplifying our ability to connect with potential customers. During the periods under review, the development of the Burger King network and brand in France allowed for an increased national marketing budget through which Burger King strengthened its marketing campaigns by commencing national television advertising. In addition to national advertising, we leverage our restaurant locations as another medium of communication with our customers primarily through local advertising and promotion campaigns. In the case of both brands, amounts collected from franchisees for such brand’s marketing and advertising budget generally must be spent during the course of the same year. We closely monitor the marketing spending and frequency of our competitors’ advertising and promotion campaigns and endeavor to maintain a relatively constant investment in order to maintain an appropriate communication presence.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations”. We use ARS to assess and compare the performance of restaurants by type and brand across periods. ARS is also used as a benchmark to compute the variable compensation component for restaurant directors, restaurant managers and team leaders if the relevant Company Restaurant out-performs. We track ARS as a key performance indicator for the Burger King network and to reduce the impact of the novelty effect in our internal reporting.

(2) Includes one Quick Franchise with Lease Management Restaurant temporarily closed as of December 31, 2019 for conversion into Burger King. (3) Includes seven Quick Franchise with Lease Management restaurants temporarily closed as of December 31, 2020 for conversion into Burger King. (4) Includes two Quick Franchise with Lease Management restaurants temporarily closed as of June 30, 2021 for conversion into Burger King. The Group has recently disposed of the remaining restaurants that it was operating under the Quick brand, including all restaurants operated internationally. See ""Summary—Recent Developments—Quick Disposal"". We currently operate 11 Quick restaurants (not including the two restaurants under conversion as of June 30, 2021) pursuant to the terms of the Quick License Agreement. (5) Quick has historically had a more heterogeneous mix of franchise arrangements which included variations of pure franchise and franchise with lease management arrangements.

(6) Includes Franchise Restaurants in the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique as of December 31, 2018, as well as Morocco for all periods presented. (7) Includes restaurants that are a part of our discontinued operations perimeter. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we had 468 restaurants in our network (consisting of 252 Quick restaurants, 203 Burger King restaurants, four Quick restaurants under conversion and nine international restaurants), of which 74% were Franchise Restaurants. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had 462 restaurants in our network (consisting of 339 Quick restaurants, 108 Burger King restaurants, eight Quick restaurants under conversion and seven international restaurants), of which 71% were Franchise Restaurants. During the periods under review, the main trends in our restaurant network have been: (i) an expansion of the Burger King network, with an increasing share of Franchise with Lease Management arrangements and an acceleration of Burger King openings resulting from Quick conversions; (ii) a contraction of the Quick network resulting from conversions into Burger King restaurants and closures of certain loss-making restaurants; and (iii) an increased focus on Franchise with Lease Management restaurants, our preferred franchise arrangement. Due to the variations in the economic terms of our franchise arrangements between Pure Franchise and Franchise with Lease Management, the growth of Franchise with Lease Management can disproportionately increase the franchise revenues 103 ----- generation as we collect a percentage of sales because the lease and business assets rights (fonds de _commerce) management fees we collect generally exceeds the fixed lease we pay to the landlord. In_ addition, our results of operations have been affected by outsized contribution of the progressively larger Burger King network due to its higher ARS.

However, it also demonstrates our ability to maintain a strong ARS despite the increase of new restaurants operated under the Burger King brand.

To do so, we calculate an estimate of the sales that would have been generated in a twelve-month period as an estimated ARS of €2.8 million (which is in line 105 ----- with the €2.8 million of ARS we generated for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021). We then apply this ARS to the restaurants in the sample by applying a cost margin or EBITDA margin, as applicable, to the estimated ARS based on the type of restaurant included in the sample, as follows: - **Company Restaurants: for the four new Burger King Company Restaurants opened or converted in the sample, we apply a cost margin to the estimated ARS, calculated on the basis of the actual restaurant costs of the entire Burger King Company Restaurant network; and - **Franchise Restaurants: for the 62 new Burger King Franchise Restaurants opened or converted in the sample, we apply an EBITDA margin to the estimated ARS, calculated on the basis of the underlying franchise arrangement of each model, _i.e., brand royalties for Pure Franchise Restaurants (representing the net amount collected after BK Europe's royalties); and (ii) brand royalties and lease and business asset fees for Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants (representing the net amount collected after BK Europe's royalties plus the net amount collected in lease and business asset fees after payments to landlords). - Fourth, we remove the restaurant operating EBITDA of former Quick restaurants that were either converted into Burger King restaurants, definitively closed or disposed as of August 31, 2021, and which generated an EBITDA during the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2021. - Fifth, we remove the restaurant operating EBITDA of any restaurants that changed their operating model during the Run-rate Period, and then estimate their restaurant EBITDA as if they had their new operating model during a twelve-month period. The new EBITDA restaurant estimations are calculated on the basis of the assumptions underlying the EBITDA estimations for each operating model described under the third step above. Based on the changes to their operating models during the period, we applied these calculations to three Burger King Company Restaurants which transferred into a Franchise Restaurant under Lease Management. - Sixth, in order to account for contractual changes in lease management rates for our Franchise Restaurants (i.e., as a result of progressive rates applied according to the year of openings), we remove the amount of franchise revenues generated by the lease management rate of these franchise restaurants with changed lease management rates during the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, and then apply the lease management rates under the current franchise agreements as of August 31, 2021. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection, estimate or guarantee of performance regarding Adjusted EBITDA generation for the year ending December 31, 2021 or any other future period which may be affected by definitive closures of Quick restaurants, the phasing out of the novelty effect and the pace of conversions (including the length of temporary closures required for conversion).

This increase in network sales for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the previous year for the same period was driven by: (i) the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, (ii) the implementation of other restrictive measures as a result of COVID-19, (iii) the rebound in activity from May 19, 2021 in connection with the easing of COVID-19 measures, (iv) new restaurant openings and (v) the development of new sales channels, such as delivery and Click & Collect options. These effects were offset by the prohibition of in-premises sales until May 19, 2021, as well as the persistence of other COVID-19 measures enforced during the second quarter of 2021, including: limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play areas, travel restrictions resulting in a limited number of tourists in France and the temporary closures of a few restaurants in high-traffic travel locations. They were also partially offset by the definitive closing or disposal of restaurants under the Quick brand over the period. _Results of operations_ The following table sets forth the consolidated results of operations of the Group for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 on a restated basis, excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC) and IFRS 5.

Company Restaurant revenues increased by €17.6 million, or 22.1%, to €97.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €79.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. The net increase in Company Restaurant revenues was mainly due to the temporary closure of all our Company Restaurants (under both the Burger King and Quick brands) between March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020 and the rebound in activity from May 19, 2021 in connection with the easing of the COVID-19 measures. In addition, such revenues increase was impacted by movements in our network over the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021, including (i) the conversion of four restaurants operated under the Quick brand and reopened under the Burger King brand with a higher ARS, (ii) the transfer of two restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand to Company Restaurants and (iii) the higher share of Burger King restaurants with a higher ARS compared to Quick restaurants. As of June 30, 2020, we operated 88 Company Restaurants, of which 70 and 17 were operated under the Burger King and Quick brands (including one temporarily closed for conversion into the Burger King brand), respectively. As of June 30, 2021, we operated 79 Company Restaurants of which 69 and 10 were operated under the Burger King and Quick brands, respectively. Franchise revenues increased by €43.2 million, or 63.2%, to €111.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €68.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mainly driven by the temporary closure of all our Franchise Restaurants (under both the Burger King and Quick brands) between March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020; the rebound in activity from May 19, 2021 in connection with the easing of the COVID-19 measures; the net increase in the overall number of restaurants operated as Franchise Restaurants during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021; and the decrease in the temporary support provided to franchisees in line with the increase in activity between 2020 and 2021. These positive effects were partially offset by the persistence of some restrictive COVID-19 measures during the first half of 2021. 115 ----- At the end of June 2020, a total of 404 restaurants were operated as Franchise Restaurants, of which 280 operated under the Burger King brand in France, 113 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and four were temporarily closed to be converted as Burger King brand restaurants. During the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the total number of Franchise Restaurants increased from 404 Franchise Restaurants at the end of June 2020 to 439 Franchise Restaurants at the end of June 2021, of which 330 operated under the Burger King in France, 100 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and two were temporarily closed restaurants to be converted into Burger King brand restaurants. Changes to our franchise network during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021 resulted in an increase of our overall franchise network, reflecting an increase in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants operated under the Burger King brand and a decrease in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand. These changes were driven by 31 restaurant openings in France (of which 28 were under the Burger King brand and three were under the Quick brand); the conversion of 17 Franchise Restaurants from Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants; the transfer of 10 restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants (which reflected five Burger King restaurants and five Quick restaurants); the transfer of two restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants which operated under the Quick brand to Company Restaurants; the disposal or definitive closing of four restaurants under the Quick brand in France and the temporary closure of two restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand to be converted to the Burger King brand. Other income increased by €31.7 million, or 274.8%, to €43.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €11.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our property development activity and to the increase in fees paid to us by third-party lessors as a direct consequence of the rebound of such activity following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. _Cost of sales_ Reported cost of sales increased by €25.2 million, or 47.9%, to €77.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €52.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated cost of sales increased by €25.9 million, or 45.7%, to €82.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €56.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in food and other costs, which was partially offset by a decrease in labor costs.

These effects were partly offset by the decrease of nine Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants. Food costs accounted for 27.1% of Company Restaurant revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to 28.2% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This slight decrease is mainly attributable to better performance at the operational level over the 2021 period as compared to the same period in 2020 in relation to the easing of COVID-19 restrictive measures, the launch of new offers with higher margins and a higher share of home delivery sales with higher sales prices. Labor costs decreased between the two periods, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of Company Restaurant revenues. However, labor costs accounted for 28.1% of Company Restaurant revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 7.4 percentage points compared to 35.5% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This decrease in labor costs as a percentage of Company Restaurant revenues was mainly due to social charge exemptions granted by the French government during the first quarter of 2021, the higher share of home delivery sales with higher sales prices, higher productivity and job subsidies. Other costs increased over the period as a direct consequence of the increase in our property development activity. _Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Reported operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) for continued activities increased by €1.3 million, or 7.9%, to €17.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €16.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €4.0 million, or 7.6%, to €56.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €52.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mostly driven by an increase in rental and other operating and occupancy costs, partly offset by a decrease in repair and maintenance costs. The following table shows our restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The decrease in repair and maintenance costs reflects the impact of cost reduction measures following the slowdown in activity linked to the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the net decrease of nine restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants. 117 ----- The increase in rental costs is mostly due to the net increase in the overall number of restaurants over the period, with the addition of 26 restaurants during the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021, as well as the fact that in the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, three additional restaurants were temporarily closed for conversion to Burger King restaurants compared to the prior period, resulting in rental costs for such restaurants being booked as non-recurring expenses. Such costs were partially offset by rebates granted by certain landlords following negotiations related to the COVID-19 crisis. The increase in other operating and occupancy costs is mainly attributable to the delivery fees invoiced by aggregators. _Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_ Reported depreciation and amortization (restaurants) for continued activities decreased by €0.5 million, or 1.4%, to €35.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €35.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €1.0 million, or 6.2%, to €15.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €16.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. _Selling costs_ Reported selling costs for continued activities increased by €6.8 million, or 68.7%, to €16.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €9.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated selling costs increased by €8.7 million or 65.9% to €21.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €13.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Franchisees under the Burger King and Quick brands contribute 3.5% of their sales and between 4.5% and 5.0% of their sales, respectively, to a marketing budget to which we also contribute the same percentage from our Company Restaurants sales. The increase in selling costs over the period was primarily attributable to the increase in Burger King's SWS by €180.8 million, or 56.0%; the increase in Quick's SWS by €13.2 million, or 13.1%; and the temporary support provided during the first semester of 2021 to restaurants that provided a lower than expected contribution rate to the marketing budget described above. Selling costs as a percentage of SWS increased by 0.4 percentage points to 3.5% for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021, from 3.1% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to the temporary support that was provided to the restaurants as described above, partially offset by the increasing share of restaurants operated under the Burger King brand, which have a lower rate of SWS dedicated to the marketing budget, within our total network of restaurants. _BK brand royalties_ Reported BK brand royalties for continued activities increased by €8.1 million, or 56.6%, to €22.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €14.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. 118 ----- Restated BK brand royalties increased by €8.1 million, or 56.6%, to €22.4 million for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021, from €14.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in Burger King's SWS, including the additional SWS generated by the 49 new Burger King restaurants opened between the two periods. _Pre-opening costs_ Reported pre-opening costs for continued activities decreased by €0.1 million, or 25.0%, to €0.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €0.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated pre-opening costs decreased by €0.1 million, or 20.0%, to €0.4 million for the sixmonth periods ended June 30, 2021 from €0.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. _Other operating income/(expense)_ Reported other operating income for continued activities increased by €0.4 million, or 44.4%, to €1.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €0.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated other operating income increased by €0.8 million, or 100.0%, to an income of €1.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €0.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. _General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Reported general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) for continued activities increased by €1.0 million, or 5.7%, to €18.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €17.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €1.1 million, or 4.7%, to €24.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €23.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mostly related to the impact of the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, leading to strong cost-reduction measures taken during the six months ended June 30, 2020, certain of which continued, although at a reduced level, during the six months ended June 30, 2021. As a percentage of sales and franchise revenues, restated general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by 4.9 percentage points to 9.7% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from 14.6% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This decrease as a percentage of sales and franchise revenues was mainly driven by the increase in revenues over the two periods. _Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_ Reported depreciation and amortization (corporate center) for continued activities increased by €0.2 million, or 6.9%, to €3.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €2.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. 119 ----- Restated depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly decreased by €0.1 million, or 6.2%, to €1.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €1.6 million for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2020. _Other corporate income and expenses_ Reported other corporate income and expenses for continued activities increased by €0.8 million, or 114.3%, to an expense of €0.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from an income of €0.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated other corporate income and expenses reflected the same figures. _Other non-recurring income and expenses_ Reported other non-recurring expenses for continued activities decreased by €1.6 million, or 51.6%, to €1.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €3.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated other non-recurring expenses increased by €1.3 million, or 39.4%, to €4.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €3.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This increase was mainly due to costs associated with the legal carve-out of the Quick activities booked during the second quarter of 2021. See “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of the Financial _Information Presented—Changes in consolidation scope”. Net financial expense_ Reported net financial expenses for continued activities increased by €2.4 million, or 7.6%, to €33.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from €31.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated net financial expenses increase by €0.1 million to €20.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 from €20.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. _Income tax_ Reported income tax for continued activities decreased by €1.2 million, or 171.4%, to an income of €0.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from an expense of €0.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. Restated income tax decreased by €2.9 million, to an income of €0.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, from an expense of €2.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. The income tax booked for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was computed based on a forecasted corporate income tax for the full year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a provision on CVAE. _Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_ Reported total share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method remained fairly stable over the two periods, reflecting an amount near zero. Restated total share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method reflected the same figures. 120 ----- _Net profit/(loss) for the period_ Reported net profit for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 increased by €45.4 million, to a net profit of €3.6 million, from a net loss of €41.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. As a result of the foregoing factors, restated net profit for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 increased by €47.3 million, to net profit of €4.4 million, from a net loss of €42.9 million for the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

This decrease in network sales was predominantly driven by COVID-19 related restrictions, including the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, when restaurants progressively reopened their drive-through windows, home delivery and takeaway services; limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play areas; travel restrictions resulting in a limited number of tourists in France over the summer of 2020; and the temporary closures of a few restaurants in high-traffic travel locations. This decrease was also due to the definitive closing or disposal of restaurants under the Quick brand during the course of 2020. The decrease in sales was partially offset by the development of new sales channels, such as delivery and Click & Collect options. _Results of operations_ The following table sets forth the consolidated results of operations of the Group for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 on a restated basis, excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC) and IFRS 5.

Company Restaurant revenues decreased by €129.8 million, or 40.1%, to €194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €323.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This 122 ----- decrease was largely driven by the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, as well as subsequent limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play areas due to COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, the decrease was also attributed to changes in our store network, including: the transfer of three restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants (of which two were operated under the Burger King brand and one was operated under the Quick brand) to franchise restaurants; the temporary closure of three Quick restaurants for conversion to the Burger King brand; and the disposal or definitive closure of one Company Restaurant operated under the Quick brand. These network changes were partially offset by (a) the opening of one new Company Restaurant under the Burger King brand, (b) the conversion of four restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand, which generated higher ARS once reopened under the Burger King brand, (c) the transfer of two restaurants formerly operated as franchise restaurants to Company Restaurants under the Quick brand, (d) the higher share of Burger King restaurants, which generate a higher ARS compared to Quick restaurants, and (e) the stronger performance and positive like-for-like sales by Company Restaurants under the Quick brand for the twelve-month period before the COVID19 crisis, as compared to the corresponding period of 2019. Franchise revenues decreased by €35.0 million, or 16.0%, to €183.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €218.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was largely driven by the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, as well as subsequent limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play areas due to COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, as a result of decreased activity due to COVID-19 impacts, the Group provided temporary support to franchises with lower brand and lease management rates during the last three quarters of 2020. These effects were partially offset by the net increase in the overall number of restaurants that were operated as franchised restaurants during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in franchise revenues over this period was less than the decrease in revenues recorded for our Company Restaurants largely due to (i) the development of our network, pursuant to which we opened more Franchise Restaurants than Company Restaurants during the period and (ii) the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 restrictions on our Company Restaurants, many of which are located in malls or commercial shopping centers, which experienced shutdowns over the period. At the end of December 2019, a total of 397 restaurants were operated as Franchise Restaurants, of which 270 operated under the Burger King brand in France, 119 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and one was temporarily closed to be converted as Burger King brand restaurants. During the last twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the total number of Franchise Restaurants increased from 397 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2019 to 422 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2020, of which 300 operated under the Burger King in France, 108 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and seven were temporarily closed restaurants to be converted as Burger King brand restaurants. Changes to our franchise network during the last twelve months ended December 31, 2020 resulted in an increase of our overall franchise network, reflecting an increase in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants operated under the Burger King brand and a decrease in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand. These changes were driven by 20 restaurant openings in France (of which 19 were under the Burger King brand and one was under the Quick brand), as well as the transfer of 11 restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants (which reflected six Burger King restaurants and five Quick restaurants). These increases in the number of franchised restaurants were partially offset by the transfer of two restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants which operated under the Quick brand to Company Restaurants, the disposal or definitive closing of four restaurants under the Quick brand in France and the conversion of five Franchise Restaurants from Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants, of which one was temporary closed to be converted at the end of December 2019. In addition, almost all of the 19 new Franchise Restaurants opened under or converted to the Burger King brand, as well as transferred from Company Restaurants, were operated under Franchise with Lease arrangements, which generate lease payments as a percentage of sales, contributing to 123 ----- franchise revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. However, this was partially offset by the effect of the temporary closures necessary to implement the conversion process. Other revenues decreased by €3.9 million, or 8.6%, to €41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was largely attributable to the decrease of fees paid by Quick brand-related partners as the direct consequence of the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, as well as subsequent limitations on the total person capacity in our lobbies and children play areas and a limited number of tourists in France over the summer of 2020 due to COVID-19 restaurant and travel restrictions. The decrease is also the direct consequence of outsourcing the Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand. _Cost of sales_ Reported cost of sales decreased by €50.1 million, or 27.5%, to €131.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €181.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated cost of sales decreased by €76.8 million, or 35.3%, to €140.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €217.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Company Restaurant cost of sales, including food costs and labor costs, primarily decreased due to the temporary closure of all our restaurants between March 16, 2020 through the end of April 2020, lower activity in the fourth quarter in relation to the COVID-19 crisis and the decrease of nine Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants. As a percentage of Company Restaurants revenues, food costs slightly decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 28.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This slight decrease is mainly attributable to better performance at the operational level, the launch of new offers with higher margins and a higher share of home delivery sales with higher sales prices. As a percentage of Company Restaurant revenues, labor costs increased by 1.2 percentage points to 32.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 31.1% for the year ended 124 ----- December 31, 2019. This increase between the two periods is mostly due to the temporary closure of restaurants during the first half of 2020 which translated into lower productivity for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other costs decreased by €1.6 million to €23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as the direct consequence of outsourcing the Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand. This decrease was partially offset by the transfer of the property development expenses generated during the first three quarters of 2020 from ""Other operating income and expenses"" to ""Other costs"" in accordance with IFRS 15. _Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Reported operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by €12.3 million, or 27.5%, to €32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by €12.0 million, or 10.5%, to €102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The decrease in repair and maintenance costs and utility costs reflect the impact of cost reduction measures implemented after the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020 and the decrease of nine Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants. Such decreases were partly offset by the decreasing share of franchise restaurants operated under Pure Franchise arrangements. The decrease in rental costs is mostly due to rebates obtained from landlords following negotiations related to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the fact that several restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand were temporarily closed to be converted into the Burger King brand, which resulted in rental costs for such restaurants being booked as non-recurring expenses. Such decreases were partly offset by the net increase of 16 restaurants in the overall number of restaurants during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. 125 ----- _Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_ Reported depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €1.6 million, or 2.2%, to €71.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €2.1 million, or 6.1%, to €32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization generated by restaurants disposed or definitively closed during the period and capital expenditure disposals in connection with disposals of fixtures to landholders in 2019. This decrease was partly offset by depreciation and amortization generated by new openings or conversions. _Selling costs_ Reported selling costs decreased by €10.6 million, or 27.3%, to an expense of €28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated selling costs decreased by €17.7 million, or 33.3%, to an expense of €35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from expenses of €53.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in Burger King’s SWS by €170.8 million, or 17.0%, and the decrease in Quick's SWS by €108.8 million, or 30.3%. Selling costs as a percentage of SWS decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly the consequence of the cancellation of marketing campaigns during the temporary closures of all restaurants beginning on March 16, 2020 and the increasing share of restaurants operated under the Burger King brand within the total network with a lower rate of SWS dedicated to the marketing budget. _BK brand royalties_ Reported BK brand royalties decreased by €2.5 million, or 6.6%, to €35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated BK brand royalties reflected the same figures. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease of SWS under the Burger King brand between the two periods, which was partially offset by the increase of brand fees rates invoiced by Burger King Corporation as the Group benefited from discounted brand fee rates in the year ended December 31, 2019 for all restaurants converted before such date. Since January 1, 2020, the stabilized brand rate (4.5%) has been applied for converted restaurants. _Pre-opening costs_ Reported pre-opening costs slightly increased by €0.1 million, or 25.0%, to €0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated pre-opening costs slightly increased by €0.1 million, or 14.3%, to €0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Other operating income/(expense)_ Reported other operating income decreased by €5.9 million, or 35.3%, to an income of €10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an income of €16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. 126 ----- Restated other operating income decreased by €6.1 million, or 36.1%, to an income of €10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an income of €16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly attributable to a lower volume of real estate transactions effectuated in the ordinary course of our business in 2020 than in 2019, partly offset by the benefit of business interruption compensation from various stakeholders related to full or partial restaurant closures, which occurred during the second and fourth quarters of 2020. _General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Reported general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by €4.1 million, or 10.2%, to €36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by €4.5 million, or 8.7%, to €47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly due to the impact of cost reduction measures implemented after the temporary closures of all restaurants from March 16, 2020. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by 2.5 percentage points to 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly related to the decrease in revenues in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the decrease in revenues following the outsourcing of the Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand. _Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_ Reported depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly decreased by €0.3 million, or 5.1%, to €5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly increased by €0.1 million, or 3.1%, to €3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Other corporate income and expenses_ Reported other corporate expenses increased by €2.7 million to an expense of €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an income of €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated other corporate income and expenses reflected the same figures. This increase is principally due to compensation granted by the Group in 2020 to partners in relation to the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. _Other non-recurring income and expenses_ Reported other non-recurring expenses decreased by €6.5 million to an expense of €12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated other non-recurring expenses decreased by €7.7 million to an expense of €13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly attributable to the settlement of a litigation with a former international franchisee, which had a negative impact on our consolidated results during the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as the decrease in the write-off of assets following the definitive closing of certain Quick restaurants. These effects were partly offset by the reversal of depreciation related to impairment of assets booked in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an increase in depreciation related to impairment of assets booked in the fourth quarter of 2020. 127 ----- _Net financial income/(expense)_ Reported net financial expense increased by €3.4 million to an expense of €65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated net financial expense decreased by €1.0 million to an expense of €40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Income tax_ Reported income tax decreased by €3.1 million, or 1,550.0%, to an income of €2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated income tax decreased by €8.7 million, or 56.1%, to an expense of €6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from an expense of €15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is principally due to income tax payments made in the fourth quarter of 2019 to authorities in Belgium in preparation for the Quick Carve-Out. _Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_ Reported share of loss of companies consolidated using the equity method increased by €0.1 million from an income of €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to a nearly zero expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. Restated share of (loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method reflected the same figures. _Net profit/(loss) for the period_ Reported net loss for the period increased by €37.1 million to a net loss of €29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from net profit of €8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the foregoing factors, restated net loss for the period increased by €44.8 million to a net loss of €29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from net profit of €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

This increase in network sales was predominantly driven by the significant growth of the Burger King restaurant network during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting 51 newly opened or converted restaurants, and the higher ARS of Burger King restaurants, generally. 128 ----- This growth in SWS was partially offset by the negative impact of the closing of one Burger King restaurant during the fourth quarter of 2019 due to its relocation, as well as the changes in the size of the Quick network, namely as a result of: (a) a net reduction of 33 restaurants in mainland France (including one Quick restaurant opening after relocation during the first quarter of 2019) due to their conversion into Burger King restaurants, their disposal or their definitive closure and (b) the definitive closing of two Quick restaurants in the French departments of la Guadeloupe and la Martinique, which in turn was offset by two restaurant openings in the second half of 2019. SWS growth was further offset by the lower ARS of Quick restaurants, generally, although this effect was itself mitigated by a positive performance for conventional Quick restaurants during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a growth of 4.5% for the first quarter, 6.5% for the second quarter, 8.2% for the third quarter and 10.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019. _Results of operations_ The following table sets forth the consolidated results of operations of the Group for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 on a restated basis, excluding, in the case of the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of IFRS 5, and in the case of the year ended December 31, 2019, the impact of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC) and IFRS 5.

Company Restaurant restated revenues decreased by €32.4 million, or 9.1%, to €323.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €356.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly due to the transfer of 27 restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants (which reflected 18 Burger King restaurants and nine Quick restaurants), and the disposal or definitive closing of one Company Restaurant operated under the Burger King brand due to its relocation and the disposal or definitive closing of five Company Restaurants operated under the Quick brand. These network changes were partially offset by two new Company Restaurant openings under the Burger King brand; one new Company Restaurant opening under the Quick brand (after its relocation); the conversion of six restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand and reopened under the Burger King brand, with a higher ARS; the transfer of nine restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants to Company Restaurants (eight of which were under the Burger King Brand and one under the Quick brand); the higher share of Burger King restaurants, which generate a higher ARS compared to Quick restaurants (approximately 77% of Company Restaurants revenues as of December 31, 2019, compared to 64% as of the year prior); and the stronger performance and positive like-for-like sales by Company Restaurants under the Quick brand for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year prior. 130 ----- Franchise restated revenues increased by €45.6 million, or 26.4%, to €218.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €172.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was largely attributable to a change in our network with a larger contribution of Franchise Restaurants under the Burger King brand within the network as of December 31, 2019. Each such restaurant generated higher revenues due to the higher ARS per restaurant, as well as the higher royalty and marketing fee rates as compared to Quick restaurants. At the end of December 2018, a total of 364 restaurants were operated as Franchise Restaurants, of which 217 operated under the Burger King brand in France, 137 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated international under the Quick brand (five and two in Morocco and the West Indies, respectively) and three were temporarily closed to be converted as Burger King brand restaurants. During the last twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the total number of Franchise Restaurants increased from 364 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2018 to 397 Franchise Restaurants at the end of December 2019, of which 270 operated under the Burger King brand in France, 119 operated under the Quick brand in France, seven operated under the Quick brand in Morocco and one was temporarily closed to be converted as Burger King brand restaurants. Changes to our franchise network during the last twelve months ended December 31, 2020 resulted in an increase of our overall franchise network, reflecting an increase in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants operated under the Burger King brand and a decrease in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants operated under the Quick brand. The increase in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants in our network operated under the Burger King brand by 53 restaurants was primarily due to the conversion of 23 restaurants from the Quick brand, the opening of 20 new restaurants and the transfer of 18 Burger King brand restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants. These increases were partly offset by the transfer of eight restaurants formerly operated as Franchise Restaurants to Company Restaurants. The decrease in the overall number of Franchise Restaurants in our network operated under the Quick brand by 20 restaurants was primarily due the conversion of 23 restaurants from the Quick brand to the Burger King brand and the disposal or definitive closure of five Franchise Restaurants. These changes were partly offset by the transfer of eight Quick brand restaurants formerly operated as Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants. In addition, almost all of the 53 new Franchise Restaurants opened under or converted to the Burger King brand, as well as transferred from Company Restaurants, were operated under Franchise with Lease arrangements, which generate lease payments as a percentage of sales, contributing to franchise revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. However, this was partially offset by the effect of the temporary closures necessary to implement the conversion process. Other restated revenues decreased by €79.0 million, or 63.4%, to €45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €124.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to the decrease in sales of the Quick dedicated logistics services to Quick franchisees, which was a direct consequence of outsourcing the Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand. This decrease was also related to the net decrease in the overall number of Quick restaurants operated as franchise restaurants prior to the outsourcing, such that the decrease in other revenues corresponds to the decrease in the Quick franchise restaurants. _Cost of sales_ Reported cost of sales decreased by €65.5 million, or 26.5%, to €181.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €247.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 131 ----- Restated cost of sales decreased by €97.8 million, or 31.0%, to €217.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €315.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

As a percentage of Company Restaurants revenues, food costs decreased by 1.1 percentage point to 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to better performance at the operational level, the launch of new offers with higher margins and lower logistics costs as a greater share of raw materials were sourced in France. As a percentage of Company Restaurant revenues, labor costs decreased by 1.4 percentage points to 31.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 32.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is due to an improvement in productivity for both the Burger King and Quick brands. Quick-dedicated logistics purchases for franchisees decreased by €70.1 million, or 73.5%, to €25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in Quick dedicated logistics purchases as a result of outsourcing the Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand. _Operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Reported operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased by €49.5 million, or 52.5%, to €44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €94.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €3.6 million, or 3.2%, to €114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 132 ----- The following table shows our restated operating and occupancy costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The decrease in repair and maintenance costs, utility costs and other operating and occupancy costs reflect the decrease of 21 Company Restaurants from the overall number of Company Restaurants. Such decreases were partly offset by the decreasing share of franchise restaurants operated under Pure Franchise arrangements. The increase in rental costs is mostly due to the net increase of 12 restaurants in the overall number of restaurants during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019 and the fact that several restaurants formerly operated under the Quick brand were temporarily closed to be converted into the Burger King brand, which resulted in rental costs for such restaurants being booked as nonrecurring expenses. _Depreciation and amortization (restaurants)_ Reported depreciation and amortization (restaurants) increased by €42.9 million, or 141.1%, to €73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated depreciation and amortization (restaurants) decreased by €1.0 million, or 2.8%, to €34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization generated by restaurants disposed or definitively closed during the period and capital expenditure disposals in connection with disposals of fixtures to landholders in 2019. This decrease was partly offset by depreciation and amortization generated by new openings or conversions. _Selling costs_ Reported selling costs increased by €3.1 million, or 8.7%, to an expense of €38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated selling costs increased by €1.4 million, or 2.7%, to an expense of €53.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in Burger King’s SWS by €227.7 million, or 29.4%. Selling costs as a percentage of SWS decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was 133 ----- mainly the consequence of the increasing share of restaurants operated under the Burger King brand within the total network with a lower rate of SWS dedicated to the marketing budget. _BK brand royalties_ Reported BK brand royalties increased by €8.7 million, or 29.8%, to €37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated BK brand royalties reflected the same figures. This increase is primarily attributable to the growth of the total number of Burger King restaurants in our network by 50 restaurants. _Pre-opening costs_ Reported pre-opening costs decreased by €1.6 million, or 80.0%, to €0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated pre-opening costs decreased by €1.3 million, or 65.0%, to €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in Company Restaurant openings during the 2019 compared to the year prior. _Other operating income/(expense)_ Reported other operating income increased by €5.6 million, or 50.5%, to an income of €16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated other operating income increased by €4.2 million, or 33.1%, to an income of €16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to a higher volume of real estate transactions effectuated in the ordinary course of our business in 2019 than in 2018. _General and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization)_ Reported general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €0.3 million, or 0.8%, to €40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by €3.7 million, or 7.7%, to €51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased by 1.4 percentage points to 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is mainly related to the decrease in revenues following the outsourcing of the Quick dedicated logistics activity in February 2019 to a new logistics supplier to follow the same model applied to the Burger King brand. _Depreciation and amortization (corporate center)_ Reported depreciation and amortization (corporate center) increased by €2.1 million, or 55.3%, to €5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated depreciation and amortization (corporate center) slightly decreased by €0.6 million, or 15.8%, to €3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 134 ----- _Other corporate income and expenses_ Reported other corporate income decreased by €1.0 million, or 38.5%, to an income of €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated other corporate income decreased by €1.0 million, or 38.5%, to an income of €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an income of €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Other non-recurring income and expenses_ Reported other non-recurring expenses decreased by €12.2 million to an expense of €19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated other non-recurring expenses decreased by €10.9 million to an expense of €20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly attributable to the reversal of depreciation related to impairment of assets booked in the fourth quarter of 2019, principally for Company Restaurants, as well as fewer conversions of Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, resulting in fewer write-offs of Quick's assets than in the year prior. These effects were partially offset by the settlement of a litigation with a former international franchisee, which had a negative impact on our consolidated results during the year ended December 31, 2019. _Net financial income/(expense)_ Reported net financial expense increased by €21.7 million, or 53.6%, to an expense of €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an expense of €40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated net financial expense increased by €0.7 million, or 1.7%, to an expense of €41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an expense of €40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Income tax_ Reported income tax decreased by €1.8 million, or 90.0%, to an expense of €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated income tax increased by €9.2 million to an expense of €15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from an expense of €6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is principally due to income tax payments made in the fourth quarter of 2019 to authorities in Belgium in preparation for the Quick Carve-Out. _Share of profit/(loss) of companies consolidated using the equity method_ Reported share of profit of companies consolidated using the equity method increased by €0.2 million to an income of €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from an expense of €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Restated share of profit of companies consolidated using the equity method reflected the same figures. 135 ----- _Net profit/(loss) for the period_ Reported net loss for the period decreased by €14.7 million to net profit of €8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from net loss of €6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the foregoing factors, restated net loss for the period increased by €21.8 million to net profit of €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from net loss of €6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

This inflow was primarily attributable to an inflow related to EBITDA, partly offset by outflows for non-recurring items, mainly related to pre-conversion costs incurred during the temporary closure of restaurants (principally comprising labor, training and rent) and net post-closure costs (including exit indemnities as applicable) incurred due to the definitive closures of Quick brand restaurants, and an outflow for income tax paid during the quarter (mainly CVAE). Cash generated/(used) by investment activities Reported cash generated/(used) by investment activities was recorded as a cash outflow of €27.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 (as compared to an outflow of €11.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020).

The net cash outflow from investment activities for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to (i) the acquisition of business goodwill and of the shares of three companies operating Burger King restaurants; (ii) investments for the completed conversions of 15 Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and two additional Quick restaurants which were temporarily closed for conversion as of June 30, 2021; (iii) investments in new restaurant openings, consisting of 15 Burger King restaurants and two Quick restaurants opened during the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021; (iv) cash outflows related to restaurant refurbishments; and (v) additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures and network management activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa). This cash outflow was partially offset by asset disposals of restaurants transferred from Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants under both the Burger King and Quick brands in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The net cash outflow from investment activities for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to (i) investments in new restaurants openings consisting of seven Burger King restaurants and one Quick restaurant; to (ii) investments for the completed conversions of 10 Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and an additional five Quick restaurants temporarily closed for conversion as of June 30, 2020; (iii) cash outflows related to Quick restaurant refurbishments; and (iv) 139 ----- additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures and network management activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa). This cash outflow was partially offset by significant disposal gains mainly related to our real estate activity during the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Restated cash generated/(used) by financing activities was recorded as a cash outflow of €20.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a cash inflow of €79.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. This outflow for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 was mainly related to (i) an outflow of €19.1 million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes); and (ii) €12.2 million of borrowing redemption. This outflow was partially offset by an inflow of €10.6 million corresponding to a new bilateral borrowing entered into during the second quarter of 2021. The €79.5 million cash inflow recorded in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 was principally related to an inflow of €145.0 million of new borrowings consisting in the full draw of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility for €60.0 million, €5.0 million of new borrowing which occurred during the first quarter of 2020 and €80.0 million of a state guaranteed loan fully funded on June 18, 2020. This inflow was partially offset by an outflow of €47.1 million mainly due to a €40.0 million repayment of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility which occurred on June 29, 2020, as well as an outflow of €18.4 million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes). _Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019_ The following table sets forth the restated statement of consolidated cash flows of the Group as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 on a restated basis, excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16 (including IFRS IC).

Restated cash generated/(used) by operating activities was recorded as an inflow of €36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an inflow €87.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the €36.6 million inflow was primarily attributable to an inflow related to EBITDA, partly offset by outflows for non-recurring items, mainly related to pre-conversion costs incurred during the temporary closure of restaurants (principally comprising labor, training and rent) and net post-closure costs (including exit indemnities as applicable) incurred due to the definitive closures of Quick brand restaurants, and an outflow for income tax paid during the quarter (mainly CVAE).

Restated cash generated/(used) by investment activities reflected the same figures. The net cash outflow from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) investments for the completed conversions of nine Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and seven additional Quick restaurants which were temporarily closed for conversion as of December 31, 2020; (ii) investments in new restaurant openings, consisting of 20 Burger King restaurants and one Quick restaurants opened during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020; (iii) cash outflows related to restaurant refurbishments; and (iv) additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures and network management activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa). This cash outflow was partially offset by asset disposals mainly related to (i) real estate activity and (ii) asset disposals of restaurants transferred from Company Restaurants to Franchise Restaurants under both the Burger King and Quick brands in the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. The net cash outflow from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to asset disposals, partly offset by (i) investments in new restaurants openings consisting of 22 Burger King restaurants and three Quick restaurants; to (ii) investments for the completed conversions of 29 Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants and an additional Quick restaurant temporarily closed for conversion as of December 31, 2019; (iii) cash outflows related to Quick restaurant refurbishments; and (iv) additional cash outflows related to maintenance capital expenditures and network management activities (namely, costs related to the conversion of Company Restaurants into Franchise Restaurants and vice versa).

This inflow was partly offset by an outflow of €85.9 million mainly due to (i) a €40.0 141 ----- million repayment of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility which occurred on June 29, 2020; (ii) a €9.1 million redemption of borrowings and lease debt; (iii) an outflow of €36.8 million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes). The €38.1 million outflow for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019 was mainly related to (i) €39.4 million related to the payment of interests (consisting primarily of accrued interests of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes) and to the closing of the litigation with a former international Quick franchisee; (ii) €9.0 million repayment of borrowings and lease debt; (iii) €7.2 million of dividends paid by the SSN Issuer to allow NewCo GB to pay its interest payments in cash; and (iv) €0.9 million capital decrease paid by the SSN Issuer to allow NewCo GB to pay its interest payments in cash.

We believe that the following fundamental characteristics of the QSR segment, as well as the scale and capabilities of the large QSR operators, have contributed to the relative strength of the segment: - trust of customers in well-known, reputable brands operating in the QSR segment; - ability of large QSR operators to implement effective sanitary measures in a rapid manner; - prevalence and availability of off-premise channels (such as Click & Collect, drive-through and delivery) during periods of lockdown and restricted on-premise consumption; and - Continued investment by QSR operators in digital channels to enhance customer experience. As a result, the QSR segment (excluding cafés and bars) has materially outperformed other OOH segments with only 23.8% decline between 2019 and 2020, compared to 37.7% decline in the overall OOH market during the same period. Similarly, according to the NPD Group, on a like-for-like basis, the QSR segment has returned to growth in the first half of 2021 with segment sales increasing 10.6% compared to the first half of 2020, whereas the overall OOH market has continued to decline 14.1% compared to the first half of 2020. As such, according to the NPD Group, the QSR segment has gained significant incremental share of the OOH market over this period, accounting for 44% and 55% of the away-from-home market in 2020 and the first half of 2021, respectively, compared to 36% in 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,The QSR Segment,18.2.2,Growth in the QSR Segment,"The QSR segment’s strong performance in France has been driven by changes in consumer habits over time. We believe that the following factors contribute to this positive trend: 150 ----- _Less time dedicated to meals_ With increasingly busier lifestyles, longer working hours and a desire to maximize leisure time, consumers devote less time to the preparation and consumption of meals. This trend favors the QSR segment, which offers consumers “on-the-go” food that they may purchase and consume quickly. _Consumer focus on affordability_ We believe that consumers have become more cost conscious in recent years as a result of the economic recession in France following the COVID-19 crisis and that their income available for restaurant discretionary spending has been constrained by the increase in spending in “tech” expenses, driving the local population to increasingly seek the greatest value for their money. According to a consumer sentiment study by the NPD Group, 46% of French people think that an attractive price is one of their main criteria to select a restaurant since the beginning of the crisis. According to a recent study by the NPD Group, within the commercial restaurant sector, the QSR segment is the most affordable with an average ticket price in 2020 of €5.42, compared to an average ticket price for full-service restaurants segment in the same period of €12.76. _Ability to increase average ticket price_ The average ticket price for restaurants in the QSR segment increased at a faster rate than other categories in the French OOH market. In France, the average ticket for the QSR segment for main meals grew at a CAGR of approximately 7.7% between 2019 and 2020. We believe that the following factors have contributed to this accelerated growth rate: - _Affordability: as the product offering within the QSR segment is significantly more affordable than other categories within the commercial restaurant sector, any increase in price naturally starts from a lower base; - _Product variety: restaurants within the QSR segment increasingly complement their classic menu options with a variety of new products to expand their traditional meal options. This variety increases customers’ basket size by encouraging them to order additional items (such as ice cream and additional portions of sides); and - _Families and groups of young adults: as more and more families choose to take certain meals out of the home, they are becoming an increasingly large part of the QSR segment’s customer base compared to other segments within the commercial restaurant sector. Families are often attracted by the lower prices, product variety and child-friendly environments common to the QSR segment. This in turn translates into higher average tickets. In addition, the QSR segment is attractive to young adults as it is more affordable than other segments within the commercial restaurant sector and provides a convivial environment for groups of young adults to interact and socialize. _Increased out-of-home consumption as a result of the dominant and growing position of chain restaurants over independents_ The increased density of chain restaurants has been one of the key factors behind the growth of the French OOH market as it has facilitated consumers’ accessibility to away-from-home dining by increasing the number of restaurants, as chains are able to open new restaurants more easily than independent operators. Chain restaurants have the ability to leverage economies of scale and benefit from a logistics advantage to provide consumers with a varied menu featuring competitively priced meals of consistent quality throughout the network. The ability of chain restaurants to offer significant pricing discounts, combined with the significant financial resources they devote to marketing campaigns, also contributes to their success. In addition, when traveling, a consumer may prefer a chain restaurant which provides a harmonized level and standard of service throughout its extensive national network. The contribution 151 ----- of chain restaurants to the commercial restaurant sector’s sales in France increased steadily between 2017 and 2020, from approximately 36.8% to approximately 40.5%. _Health and wellness_ In recent years, consumers have become increasingly health-conscious and mindful of the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet. This heightened awareness is partly due to ongoing health and wellness campaigns across Europe, emphasizing the benefits of “healthy” foods such as meat alternatives, fresh fruits and vegetables. Consumers are also increasingly knowledgeable about specific diet-related health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and obesity, which has led to an increase in the demand for healthier food products such as fish, vegetables and poultry. Players in the QSR segment have been able to quickly adapt to changing health and wellness trends, with major chain restaurants now highly focused on improving the nutritional quality of their offerings and communicating nutritional information on the packaging of their products. QSR players are also committed to developing and expanding their menus to incorporate healthier alternatives (for example, plant-based meat alternatives, salad and fresh fruit), which appeals to a wider consumer base. _Growing share of non-traditional daypart consumption in the QSR segment_ The QSR segment has historically generated the largest part of its sales during traditional dayparts, with customer traffic generally concentrated around lunchtime, and to a lesser extent during dinner. In recent years, QSR operators have continued to expand their menu offering into non-traditional dayparts, such as breakfast, coffee and snacks, by leveraging their convenience-driven service models. With increasing consumer receptivity to convenient and affordable options, this represents a growth opportunity for QSR players to address incremental demand and capture a larger share of meal occasions throughout the day. _Growing use of digital channels_ Digital channels and tools have steadily gained traction within the QSR segment with the increasing accessibility and consumer acceptance of various digital tools. As a result, digital sales have become an important driver of growth for QSR operators, driven both by increased consumer convenience and the expansion of digitally-enabled value propositions. Branded mobile applications and presence on third-party delivery applications enable QSR players to build a direct relationship with customers and create a fully-integrated and highly-convenient experience, whether through Click & Collect or home delivery. Furthermore, growth in digital sales provides the ability to leverage the existing network of QSR operators, which helps achieve operating efficiencies, for example through the use of digital kiosks, tablets and mobile payments, which enhances the customer journey for on-premise and drive-through customers. With the continued expansion of this channel, QSR operators also have the opportunity to increase brand awareness through the use of social media, leverage valuable customer data to acquire new customers and extract higher customer lifetime value through digital loyalty programs. During the COVID-19 crisis, the growth in the use of digital channels has been further accelerated by the lockdowns and curfews restricting on-premise consumption, resulting in a 22% year on year growth in digital orders for commercial restaurant in France in March 2021 according to the NPD Group. As of the end of May 2021, according to the NPD Group, QSR is leading the path, representing up to 81% of digital orders in commercial restaurants. 152 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The QSR segment comprises any type of restaurant serving “on-the-go” food such as hamburgers, sandwiches, kebabs, fried chicken, sushi, pizza or health conscious quick service 149 ----- restaurants. Chain restaurants play an important role in the QSR segment. Sales in the QSR segment totaled approximately €19.5 billion in 2019 and grew at a CAGR of approximately 6.8% between 2017 and 2019; whereas the French OOH market overall grew at a CAGR of approximately 3.0% during the same period. In 2020, the QSR segment generated approximately €13.4 billion in sales, representing a decline of approximately 31.2% as compared to 2019; whereas the French OOH market overall declined by 37.7% during the same period. It is expected that sales in the overall QSR segment will grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.8% between 2019 and 2023 (9.0% between 2021 and 2023).

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,The QSHR category,18.3.1,,"The largest category of the QSR segment in France is the QSHR category, which in 2019 recorded approximately €8.1 billion of sales, representing approximately 60% of the total sales in the QSR segment (excluding cafés and bars). In 2020, the QSHR category recorded approximately €6.2 billion of sales. Chain restaurants play an important role in the QSHR category, generating in excess of approximately 97% of the category’s sales in 2020. Sales in the QSHR category grew at a CAGR of approximately 8.4% between 2017 and 2019. The graphic below shows the split of the QSHR segment (excluding cafés and bars) in France in 2020 in terms of sales. During the COVID-19 crisis, the QSHR category has been the most resilient category within the QSR segment. Similar to the trends discussed above, the large QSHR operators within the category have benefited from consumer trust in their well-known brands, their ability to take effective sanitary measures and the availability of off-premise channels during lockdown periods. As a result, according to GIRA Foodservice, the QSHR category has outperformed other QSR categories with only 22.9% decline between 2019 and 2020, compared to a 37.1% decline in the overall QSR segment excluding QSHR during the same period. We believe that the ability of QSHR chains to adapt their offering to consumer demands (such as speed of service, extended operating hours, children/family-friendly environment and food as an indulgence) is a key factor underlying the success of the QSHR category compared to other QSR categories or the commercial restaurant sector (see “—The QSR Segment—Growth in the QSR _Segment—Increased out-of-home consumption as a result of the dominant and growing position of chain restaurants over independents”)._ The QSR segment overall, and the QSHR segment in particular, have been the fastest growing restaurants in the French commercial restaurant market over the 2017 to 2019 period as well as between 2019 and 2020, and are expected to continue this trend through 2023, which are demonstrated by the charts below. 153 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Competitive landscape,18.4.1,,"As discussed above, QSHR sales are the largest category of the approximately €13.4 billion QSR (excluding cafés and bars) segment in France as of 2019 (€10.2 billion as of 2020). The main players in the QSHR category are McDonald’s and Burger King, which together accounted for approximately 84% of QSHR category sales in France as of the first half of 2021, according to the NPD Group. As of December 31, 2020, McDonald’s had 1,468 restaurants in France, and Burger King had 399 restaurants as of June 30, 2021. The third player in France, KFC, operated a network of 272 restaurants in France as of December 31, 2020. The following graphic presents the market share of chain restaurants in the QSHR category in terms of market share as of the first half of 2021: According to the NPD Group, from 2017 to March 2021, the market share of Burger King in the QSHR segment doubled to approximately 15% (7 percentage points increase), as compared to KFC’s market share, which increased by approximately 2 percentage points, and as compared to McDonald’s market share, which decreased by approximately 4 percentage points. Furthermore, our market share in QSHR digital sales, referring to delivery and Click & Collect, increased to approximately 14% following its launch in France in 2020, as compared to KFC's market share, which decreased by approximately 4%, and McDonald's market share, which decreased by approximately 0.6 percentage points. Our main competitor, McDonald’s, focuses its business model on appealing to a large consumer base with an extensive product offering which it tailors to appeal to the French consumer. It operates a similar franchise business model to that of Burger King. As of 2017, approximately 80% of its restaurants are operated by franchisees and the other 20% are directly operated by the company. KFC operates a smaller network in France than Burger King. We believe that KFC currently has an established, specific customer base, but that it is willing to expand its base to a broader clientele, in particular by appealing to families, who have proven to be an important factor for the entire QSR segment. 154 ----- In addition to competing with other QSHR players, we also compete with the second largest category within the QSR segment, sandwich shops and viennoiseries. Sandwich shops and viennoiseries had total sales of approximately €2.2 billion in 2019 (€1.6 billion in 2020). Generally considered to be a healthy meal choice, sandwiches are popularly known as French fast food and target a different usage than hamburgers. In 2020, sandwich shops in France maintained approximately a 16.4% market share (in terms of sales) of the QSR segment (excluding cafés and bars). Sandwich shops’ sales grew at a CAGR of approximately 2.9% between 2017 and 2019 and declined 28.2% between 2019 and 2020 (compared to the approximately 8.4% CAGR and 22.9% decline for the QSHR category over the same period). However, competition between hamburgers and sandwiches is limited as QSHR restaurants and sandwich shops have different market positions. Generally, QSHR restaurants appeal to a wider consumer base. Restaurants in this category include drive-thru locations, city center restaurants and restaurants located in shopping centers. Sandwich shops however, are principally located in city centers. In addition, sandwich shops tend to target the working population; whereas QSHR restaurants aim to appeal to a younger clientele (mainly, between 15 and 34 years old) and children and families (for example, by including kids menus and playground areas). Lastly, sandwich shop’s sales are mostly concentrated around lunch time. QSHR restaurants, however, serve meals that are relatively equally distributed between lunch and dinner. Further, sandwich shops rarely offer their customers the ability to consume their meals on site. A critical feature of the QSHR restaurant is that consumers are free to choose whether to consume their meal on site or elsewhere. This offers consumers an additional choice that most sandwich shops are unable to provide their customers. Notwithstanding the projected overall growth of the sandwich shop category, this category is highly fragmented, with a significant majority of sandwich shops in France owned by independents and the remainder by chain restaurants (for example, Brioche Dorée, Paul and Subway) which systematically enjoy a more positive image than hamburger restaurants. A significant majority of sandwich shops in France are owned by independents and the remainder by chains (for example, Brioche Dorée, Paul and Subway). Other than Subway, which operated approximately 350 locations in France, it is unlikely that any single sandwich shop chain in France currently has sufficient resources or influence to match that of the two major QSHR chain restaurants in terms of advertising and communications. Although we do not consider Subway to be a direct competitor, it does compete for a similar customer base, mainly in city center areas, as all of their restaurants are located in these areas. There are also other categories within the QSR segment in France such as kebab, sushi, pizza and other types of snack restaurants that are experiencing overall growth. However, these types of restaurants remain marginal within the QSR segment in France, and represented, in the aggregate, approximately 23.2% of the market share in terms of sales in 2019. 155 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Guided by the Burger King philosophy of “Have it your way”, we offer customers a differentiated eating experience, combining high-quality food, such as our flame-grilled hamburgers, with attractive restaurant locations. In 2013, our principal shareholder Groupe Bertrand reintroduced the Burger King brand to the French market after a 15-year absence, by signing of an exclusive master franchise agreement between Burger King France and BK Europe, the holder of the Burger King brand. Groupe Bertrand is a leader in the French restaurant industry, known for its ability to roll out and transform restaurant concepts. Following our acquisition in 2015 of Financière Quick Group, an incumbent QSHR operator with nearly 400 prime restaurant locations in France, we demonstrated a successful track-record of expansion of our Burger King network in France, both through the conversion of Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, as well as through new Burger King restaurant openings. As of June 30, 2021, we operated 412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion) and as of August 31, 2021, we operated 413 restaurants under the Burger King brand (425 restaurants including nine restaurants under the Quick brand to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and three Quick restaurants under conversion). Our mission is to continue to deliver a high-quality service to our customers and support the growth of our franchisees through expansion of new Burger King restaurants. We are committed to strict development criteria, prioritizing sustainable initiatives and seeking to exploit economies of scale to further growing our EBITDA. Our business model features a mix of predominantly Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants and Pure Franchise Restaurants, and to a lesser extent Company Restaurants. We believe this model enables us to manage our growth flexibly while controlling the locations of the restaurants in our network. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 83% of our Burger King restaurants are Franchise Restaurants under the Burger King brand and the remaining 17% are Company Restaurants, a balance that supports our gross margin and reduces our capital expenditure requirement for expansion. As of June 30, 2021, we were the direct lessee for or owner of approximately 87% of the restaurant locations in our network, compared to 85% of the restaurant locations in our network as of December 31, 2018. In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. The strong recognition of the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide, serves as a solid base to attract customers and prospective franchisees. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the average restaurant sales (“ARS”) for Burger King restaurants was approximately €2.8 million. We are the second largest QSHR chain in France, with locations throughout the country and approximately 15% market share by sales of burgers in 2021 (up from 8% in 2017), generating €1,056.7 million in SWS, €448.3 million in revenue (reported) and €151.3 million of Adjusted EBITDA (reported) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, with 412 restaurants as of June 30, 2021 (399 of which were under the Burger King brand). 156 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Established in 1997, Groupe Bertrand, founded more than 20 years ago, specializes in the restaurant industry in France and is active across several segments of the commercial restaurant sector, including through the operation of restaurants, both chains and individual restaurants, master franchises and concessions. Groupe Bertrand operates several well-known restaurant throughout France including large breweries (such as L’Alsace, Au Pied de Cochon, le Bar André à La Rochelle, Bofinger, la Brasserie Lipp, La Coupole, Grand Café Capucines, La Lorraine, Le Procope, Terminus Nord, Vaudeville); Parisian restaurants (such as Auteuil Brasserie, L’Île, Copenhague, Flora Danica, Polpo, Quai Ouest, Les Deux Stations, Le Sir Winston); tea rooms (such as Angelina); concessions and events (such as Château de Versailles, Jardin des Plantes, Jardin des Tuileries, Jardin du Luxembourg, Giverny, Cité des Sciences, Printemps Haussmann, Musée des Armées); chains (such as Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Café Leffe, Bert’s, Volfoni, Léon); and fast food restaurants such as Burger King France. Groupe Bertrand is also active in the leisure and hotels industry. Burger King previously operated in France between 1980 and 1997, when it decided to discontinue its operations in France for strategic reasons. Following a 15-year absence from the French market, Burger King returned to France first in Marseille Provence airport in 2012 and then in Paris at the Saint-Lazare train station in 2013. Once Burger King France signed the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe in November 2013, both restaurants became part of Burger King France. In 2014, the Burger King App was first launched. In 2015, Burger King France’s first full year of activity, 16 Burger King restaurants were opened in France. In December 2015, we acquired Quick as a means of accelerating our penetration of the French market through a process of converting Quick locations into Burger King locations. Quick, founded in 1970 as one of the first European QSR chains and which had expanded into France in 1980, held an extensive network of 393 restaurants as of December 31, 2015. In order to focus on building the Burger King brand in France, we launched the Quick conversion program which involved selling the Quick activities in Belgium and Luxembourg in September 2016. The first Quick conversion was in September 2016, with a total of 36 converted restaurants in 2016. In 2017, we aired our first advertising on national television. In July 2018, Bridgepoint acquired a minority stake in a holding company of Burger King France to further support the development of the Burger King brand in France alongside Groupe Bertrand. Following a total of 224 conversions of Quick restaurants to Burger King restaurants, in October 2021, we completed the disposal of the remaining restaurants operating under the Quick brand through the sale of 100% of the shares of Quick Restaurants S.A. As of June 30, 2021, we operated a total of 412 restaurants, including 399 Burger King restaurants, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion. During our early ramp up period from 2013 to 2015, the number of our restaurants grew from 3 in 2013 to 16 in 2014 and to 42 in 2015. During our conversion period, the number of our restaurants increased to 108 in 2016 to 203 in 2017 and to 290 in 2018. In addition, there were 70 conversions of Quick in 2017 and 63 conversions in 2018. Our switch to an asset-light business model allowed our number of restaurants to grow to 340 in 2019 and 369 in 2020, with a projected total of 435 in 2021.

The QSR segment has historically experienced a steady growth rate in France, and we believe that it has significant untapped potential. According to GIRA Foodservice, absolute sales in the French QSR market grew at a CAGR of 6.8% per annum between 2017 and 2019 from approximately €17.1 billion in 2017 to €19.5 billion in 2019. The QSR market has historically been the key driver of growth in the OOH market, with a CAGR of 6.8% between 2017 and 2019, compared to a 157 ----- CAGR of 3.5% for the commercial restaurants and a CAGR of 3.0% for the total OOH). Based on GIRA Foodservice, the QSR market also increased its share of the commercial restaurants market from 32% in 2017 to 41% in 2020. Although QSR market sales temporarily decreased in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in absolute terms (decreasing by 31.2% between 2019 and 2020), according to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, sales have significantly increased by 10.6% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period during the prior year. The QSHR category in the broader QSR market also exhibited growth throughout these same periods. QSHR is the largest category within the broader QSR segment and has been a significant driver of the growth in the French QSR market. According to GIRA Foodservice, sales in the QSHR market grew at a CAGR of 8.4% between 2017 and 2019, from approximately €6.9 billion in 2017 to €8.1 billion in 2019. As with the QSR segment as a whole, the QSHR market temporarily decreased in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit at a lower rate than the QSR market. We observed the relative resilience of the QSR market and outperformance of the QSHR market during COVID-19 compared to the total commercial restaurants/total OOH, with a decrease of 22.9% in absolute sale in the QSHR segment and 31.2% in the QSR segment versus 42.2% for the total commercial and 37.7% for the total OOH in 2020 compared to 2019. Notwithstanding this temporary decrease in 2020, according to the NPD Group on a like-for-like basis, the QSHR market's sales increased by 29.7% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period during the prior year. Based on GIRA Foodservice, its share in the QSR market increased from 40% in 2017 to 47% in 2020. In addition, GIRA Foodservice expects sales in the QSR segment to exceed 2019 levels in 2022, with projected sales amounting to €20.6 billion in 2022 as compared to €19.5 billion in 2019. GIRA Foodservice expects the QSR market to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.8%, between 2019 and 2023, compared to a growth at a CAGR of approximately 0.6% in the overall commercial restaurants sector in France, which is expected to increase its sales from approximately €56.4 billion in 2019 to €57.7 billion in 2023. We believe the French QSR market has significant penetration potential and that we are poised to take advantage of this growth. The QSR market in France, which was a €19.5 billion market in 2019, has a lower penetration rate than other Western European countries, although it is growing fast and roughly in line with the growth rates in such other countries. For example, the QSR market grew in France at a rate of 7.4% between 2018 and 2019 and the QSHR category grew at a rate of 9.3% over the same period. Further, we believe there is significant whitespace potential in France based on the average annual commercial foodservice spend per inhabitant in France (€640), which in the year 2017 was much lower as compared to its neighboring countries, such as the United Kingdom (€831) or Belgium (€842), according to GIRA Foodservice. The French market is generally characterized by more stringent anti-competition regulations than other Western European markets, limiting the number of chains in operation in France, which could prevent new market entrants. In addition, we believe that our successful business model serves as a barrier to entry because brand equity and prime locations throughout mainland France cannot be easily replicated by new entrants due to the significant investment levels required and the necessary time to attain our economies of scale, operational and logistics know-how. As a result, through our established presence in the French market, we believe we have a strong competitive advantage in the face of potential competitors or new market entrants. This long-term growth potential is underpinned by structural changes in customer habits and way of life, which we believe are favorable for QSR restaurant operators. These trends include increasing digital penetration and out-of-home convenience-oriented food consumption, favoring value for money, preferences for health-conscious and quality product offerings and the expansion of daypart opportunities. Such structural trends in French society foster an increased demand for the QSR segment. According to NPD, there has been a 5 percentage points growth in share of restaurant chains to 61% as of March 2021 year on year. Furthermore, 46% of French people name attractive price as their main selection criteria for a restaurant. Certain of these favorable trends were accelerated as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, customers have more increasingly relied on digital channels (such as home delivery and Click & Collect options) and convenient and affordable dining options. According to NPD, the QSR share of commercial restaurants digital orders is now 81% with a 22% growth in digital orders as of March 2021 year on year. More than 90% of Burger King France restaurants offer Click & Collect following the launch in 2020.

Throughout these periods, our Group has also demonstrated strong sales per unit, with average sales per unit in 2019 of €3.2 million for restaurants with more than 12 months of historical operation. Our leading market position in France is underpinned by the distinctive Burger King global brand and high local recognition in France. We are Burger King’s master franchisee in France and are well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry worldwide. Burger King is the world’s second largest QSHR chain in terms of total number of restaurants with over 18,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The chain had more than $20.0 billion of SWS for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a Burger King master franchisee we benefit from Burger King’s international brand awareness, its distinctive product offer, unique cooking method, efficient and reliable supply chains and food quality reputation. We also benefit from Burger King's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and generate increased footfall in our restaurants. Over the years, Burger King has launched innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns that highlight the popular relevance of the Burger King brand globally. We believe we are well positioned to further increase our market position by closing the market share gap between ourselves and McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, which held 69% market share as of the first half of 2021 Our strong brand awareness and growing market share are supported by our high-quality and innovative product offering, our focus on expanding digital convenience options for our customers and our unique local communication strategy. Our focus on innovation in terms of digital convenience for our customers has further contributed to the strengthening of our market share. Following the launch of home delivery and Click & Collection options respectively in 2019 and in 2020, our market share of digital sales (measured by the number of transactions) steadily increased to 14% as of March 2021. In addition, we also expanded our digital sales channel in 2020 through the mobile Burger King app, which now includes our expanded customer loyalty program. Our Burger King app was downloaded on average 5,000 times a day during the first six months of 2021 and has increased to a daily download rate of 10,000 times a day during promotions. Our Kingdom loyalty program had more than 3.6 million registered members as of the end of September 2021. In addition, over the last few years we have expanded home delivery options through our partnerships with home delivery services such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. Our rate of home delivery increased by four times from 15 transactions per day per restaurant in July and August 2019 to more than 60 transactions per day per restaurant in July and August 2021. We expect the volume of our digital sales to increase, along with growth in the French QSR market and as digital penetration grows in line with increased focus on digital convenience. We enjoy strong brand recognition in France, supported by customer's perception of the taste and quality of our products according to KANTAR. In 2021, Burger King was ranked the highest among QSR brands in France, over McDonald’s, KFC, Paul, Domino’s and Brioche Dorée, according to a KANTAR consumer survey that asked customers how good they felt about the food at each of these QSR brands. In addition, we invest annually (through contributions from both our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants) in innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns at the French national level, which we believe reinforce Burger King’s growing brand awareness in France and have 159 ----- a positive impact on our level of SWS. According to an IFOP (Institut français d'opinion publique) survey on the French population, our brand awareness has improved in France from 72% Spontaneous Awareness in 2018 to 83% in 2021 while our Total Brand Awareness has remained stable reflecting 91% in both 2018 and 2021. In addition, according to KANTAR, our brand equity has also improved, with an increase in the power of our brand equity from 18 in March 2018 to 21 in April 2021 (out an index of 100). The strong and growing recognition of the Burger King brand in France, together with Burger King’s significant restaurant network worldwide, serves as a solid base to further increase our market share.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Competitive Strengths,18.7.3,Broad footprint and diversified channel mix with strong digital and contactless capabilities,"Our extensive restaurant network reflects a balanced approach of different formats and sizes appropriately tailored for each of the locations in which we operate. We choose our restaurant sites carefully and have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process that incorporates our management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our restaurant development team has extensive experience identifying and evaluating suitable restaurant locations. As of June 30, 2021, we operated a network of 412 restaurants (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the shortterm and two Quick restaurants under conversion). At each of our sites, we select and develop one of three of our principal restaurant formats: a free-standing drive-through facility format, a downtown format and a shopping center or mall format. As of June 30, 2021, 328 of our restaurants reflected a drive-through facility format, 39 of our restaurants reflected a downtown format, 26 of our restaurants reflected a shopping center or mall format and 19 restaurants reflected other formats (including restaurants located in travel locations such as airports, train stations and highway service concessions). For our drive-through facility restaurants, which have historically represented our largest restaurant type, we have developed three different restaurants sizes to best address market potential. We are also focused on ensuring that most of our restaurant locations are well-suited to offer both take away and home delivery services to our customers. We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed complementary multi-channel offerings that we believe have favorably positioned us to respond to evolving customer trends. Particularly, we believe our multi-channel offering has underpinned the resilience of our business (including during COVID-19) and maximize customer reach. Our customers can access our product offer through multiple channels, including on-site through in-restaurant dining or drive-through orders, online through Click & Collect services (which include services for on-site Click & Collect pick up through our parking lots or drive-through lines or home delivery) and home delivery services (either through third-party aggregators such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. In addition, we intend to begin to roll out our own home-delivery services in certain locations, which we believe demonstrate an opportunity to further develop our multi-channel approach. 160 ----- A breakdown comparing our SWS by channel for the December 2019 and August 2021 period are reflected in the chart below: We have further optimized our restaurants and customer journey with a number of digital initiatives that are consistent across all of our channels to better cater to our customers and improve their dining experience. For example, we have enhanced our drive-through experience by accelerating the order process through the use of digital tablets in our drive-through sites. All our restaurants have been equipped with in-store kiosks since 2015. Since 2019, our drive-through capacity has doubled based on the average number of cars per hour that passed through the drive-through. We have also developed our mobile app to allow for Click & Collect orders directly in-app to facilitate easy ordering. To further improve customers' in-dining experience, in 2021 we rolled out geolocalized table service in approximately 250 restaurant locations, allowing dine-in customers to receive their meals directly at their table and further supporting market share gains in the key target family demographic. As of the date hereof, table service is available in more than half of our restaurant network, and we are targeting the implementation of this service in approximately 80% to 90% of our restaurant network by the end of 2022. Customers can also now register purchases to their loyalty programs via scanner capabilities on every touch point in order to facilitate customer identification. Thanks to our single PoS IT system that is fully integrated across all of our network and distribution channels, we are able to achieve futureproof and scalable state-of-the-art operations monitoring and process management.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Competitive Strengths,18.7.4,Agile business model with best-in-class operational expertise,"We believe navigating the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business model and our ability to respond quickly to unprecedented business disruption. At the on-set of the pandemic, our management team rapidly implemented various cash management measures to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our operations and liquidity position. Our management team prioritized various initiatives to strengthen our liquidity position, including by drawing in full our Existing Revolving Credit Facility for a total of €60 million and entering into the state-guaranteed PGE Loan (contrat de prêts garantis par l’État français) for a total of €80 million. In addition, in an effort to manage cash during the restrictive periods of the pandemic, we ceased most external service expenditures such as cleaning, security and maintenance, both in our restaurants and at our headquarters, and temporarily renegotiated our rental obligations of certain of our Company Restaurants and supported our franchisees in the renegotiations of their rental obligations for certain periods with our landlords. As a result, we were able to maintain a strong level of free cash flow since the start of the pandemic. Further, we were focused on supporting our franchisees through the challenges of the pandemic and closely monitored their financial health, adapting our support initiatives as the impact of the pandemic on our franchisees' performance evolved. For example, during the period 161 ----- of the first lockdown in France, we implemented temporary royalty adjustments for our franchisees. We also temporarily waived the obligation of our franchisees to pay us a minimum lease management fee. As a result of such measures, none of our franchisees experienced a default of their payment obligations to third parties. We further believe that our strong restaurant-level operations coupled with our tight cost control and disciplined cash management have allowed us to further enhance our resilient model to withstand any future crises. In response to the pandemic, we implemented robust operational protocols to safely continue our activity in compliance with government restrictions. While our restaurant opening plan was impacted by the pandemic, we were still able to open a number of new restaurants during the COVID19 period and plan to continue to carry out the final conversions from the few remaining Quick restaurants to the Burger King brand, which we believe demonstrates the confidence of our franchisees and the strength of our strategy. In addition, in continuation of our digital strategy and to cope with external restrictions, we further enhanced our multi-channel offerings, including through the expansion of our drive-through and takeaway services by using new Click & Collect channels as of July 2020, the development of our home delivery options and our integration with third-party delivery aggregators. The further enhancement of such offerings allowed us to protect our top line during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions by offsetting the reduction in on-premise customer traffic and allowing customers to access our products through alternate channels. Following the return of on-premises dining with the easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures, we continue to benefit from the robust contribution of our off-premises channels, such as delivery and Click & Collect options. We also regularly and proactively communicated with our customers, which had a positive impact on our brand image. In response to a KANTAR survey in April 2021 which asked to what extent customers' image of fast food brands has improved, maintained or gotten worse in the last months of the COVID-19 pandemic, 25% of respondents indicated that Burger King had improved. Pursuant to the survey results, Burger King's operations reflected the highest proportion of responses indicating improvement as compared to other fast food chains in France that were mentioned in the survey, including McDonald's, KFC, Domino's and Subway. In addition to the foregoing measures, we remained committed throughout the pandemic periods to our ESG best practices, including introducing menu innovations that were healthy and nutritious, such as the launch of our bowls and plant based offerings, and our continued efforts to enhance our supply chain with local sourcing and pro-environment initiatives. We believe that our SWS before and after each of the most severe COVID-19-related restrictive periods in France (i.e., the first and second lockdowns in March to May 2020 and October to December 2020) demonstrate our ability to rapidly ramp up and down, with monthly sales immediately following each lockdown nearly recovering to pre-lockdown periods. For example, in June 2020, our SWS under the Burger King brand recovered to €73 million as compared to the €85 million pre-lockdown level in February 2020. Similarly, in December 2020, the month during which the second lockdown restrictions were lifted, our SWS reached €86 million as compared to the €94 million pre-lockdown SWS recorded in October 2020. Further, despite the implementation of a curfew in France ending in June 2021, we were able to achieve consistently increasing SWS levels from April 2021 through August 2021, which we believe emphasizes the resilience of our business model, further supported by the long-term integration of the measures we adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a demonstration of this resilience our SWS in the months following the easing of lockdown restrictions in July and August 2021 reached historically record levels. 162 ----- A breakdown of our SWS for each of our channels over the course of first lockdown, second lockdown and post-lockdown periods is presented below: Further, a breakdown of our monthly SWS during the period beginning January 1, 2020 through August 31, 2021, as well as a breakdown of our quarterly EBITDA over those same periods, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2019 is presented below:",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Competitive Strengths,18.7.5,Asset-light business model with high cash conversion,"Our successful franchise-based business model, including a robust network of committed franchise partners, generates recurring and predictable revenues with high EBITDA margin. As of June 30, 2021, 83% of our Burger King network restaurants were Franchise Restaurants under our Burger King brand (compared to 70% as of December 31, 2016), with 17% of our restaurants operated as Company Restaurants (compared to 30% as of December 31, 2016). While our previous strategy was focused on the conversion of Quick restaurants and the progressive switch toward franchise 163 ----- restaurants, our current approach reflects a continuous focus on franchising most of our restaurants (29 out of 30 restaurant openings were franchise restaurants over the six-month period ended June 30, 2021), and we are now moving from conversions to new openings. This asset-light model allows for higher cash conversion and reduces or eliminates for locations with third-party landlord agreements our capital expenditures for such franchise openings. The table below demonstrates our enhanced cash conversion (measured as pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA minus restaurant opening and conversion capex divided by pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA) in recent years following our adoption of an asset-light franchise-focused model for new restaurant openings, as compared to prior years. Our annual cash conversion ratio increased from 4%, 2% and 19%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as compared to 73%, 59% and 74%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and the twelve months ended August 31, 2021. We believe that our ""asset-light"" operating model generates enhanced cash conversion and significant recurring free cash flow primarily driven by royalties and lease payments collected from franchisees based on sales levels, while limiting our capital expenditures. The corporate infrastructure and capital expenditures necessary to support a franchise business model are substantially less than a company-operated system, as franchisees and landlords assume most capital expenditure costs. In particular, most of our openings are operated by franchisees under a lease management contract, and when this franchise model is combined with third party landlord agreements we bear no capital expenditure. We expect the continued success of our asset-light operating model, underpinned by the completion of most of our Quick conversions pursuant to the disposal of most of our Quick restaurants (see “Business—Quick Disposal”) and our continued preference for the Franchise with Lease Management arrangements combined where possible with third party landlord agreements. In addition, our franchise-based model allows us to retain strong control over our network through our standard agreements with our franchisees, which govern various aspects of our relationship, including the royalties and fees due by them to us. We believe that our franchise model offers us favorable upsides and that our emphasis on growing this model in the future will continue to drive high cash conversion.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Our network of Burger King brand restaurants expanded from 16 as of December 31, 2014 to 399 as of June 30, 2021. Following the Quick Disposal, we expect our network to increase, with over 400 targeted locations already identified, providing us with significant room for further growth, particularly in light of the moderatelypenetrated French QSR market. For example, McDonald’s, our largest competitor in France, has a denser network of restaurants in France than Burger King, with approximately 1,500 restaurants (as of June 2021) for McDonald’s, compared to 412 restaurants (as of June 2021) for Burger King (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion). We believe we are well-positioned to close the network density gap between ourselves and McDonald's and to further increase our market positioning. We plan to further expand our Burger King brand restaurant network in collaboration with current and new franchisees to continue to increase our market share in the French QSHR category. We expect that a higher density of restaurants will further contribute to brand awareness, support customer loyalty and increase traffic in our existing restaurants, while our new restaurants will benefit from our strong brand, reputation and know-how. We have a rigorous approach to expansion and expect to promote new restaurant growth through the opening of Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, which allow us to retain a high degree of control over our network of restaurants, with limited capital expenditure. Opening Company Restaurants requires significantly higher capital expenditures and adds leases and personnel costs to our cost structure, whereas in franchise arrangements, the cost impact of adding a new Franchise Restaurant is significantly reduced.

We source a wide range of ingredients, including beef and chicken, potatoes and other fresh and frozen products and a variety of sauces to form our menu and we also incur logistics costs to store inventory and transport raw materials and semi-finished products to such restaurant locations. Our food and logistics costs are significant, and we believe that we could drive our gross margin through enhanced control of our logistics costs by exploiting economies of scale in line with the growth of our restaurant network, further developing local supplier networks and implementing cost control measures to reduce 166 ----- food waste. For example, we require all of our Burger King franchisees to source their raw materials from suppliers that BKC has previously approved and with whom we intend to continue to leverage our extensive restaurant network and economies of scale to obtain the most favorable commercial terms. In addition, suppliers have sought to invest in long-term partnerships with us, which has allowed us to reduce food costs and secure dedicated product lines to satisfy our needs.

Certain default provisions under the Master Franchise Agreement include, among others: (i) failure to pay BKC amounts we owe under the Master Franchise Agreement; (ii) transferring or assigning our rights under the Master Franchise Agreement; (iii) if we or any of our affiliates acquire an interest in a competitor; or (iv) if we enter into insolvency proceedings. If the Master Franchise Agreement is terminated for any reason, we do not lose the right to continue the operation of the Burger King restaurants that we have already established. However, we will lose our exclusivity right and be unable to further expand our presence and market share in France. The Master Franchise Agreement also contains certain covenants related to the expansion of Burger King in France that we must respect in order to maintain the exclusive development rights for the Burger King brand in France. Under the terms of the Master Franchise Agreement, after December 31, 2021 (unless otherwise agreed with BKC), we will no longer be able to operate Quick restaurants anywhere in the world. Thus, following the conversion or definitive closure in the short-term of the small number of remaining Quick restaurants that we will continue to operate pursuant to the Quick License Agreement, we intend to focus entirely on the Burger King brand. Franchisees have historically been an important part of our business. Pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement, we may enter into franchise agreements with third parties to operate and manage their own Burger King 168 ----- restaurants in France. We believe that franchisees provide us with the ability to expand our presence in France while controlling our capital expenditures. As the master franchisee for France, we are responsible for the management and strategic development of the network’s brand development, promotion, execution of a marketing and advertising strategy and certain other services, for which we are remunerated by franchisees through fees and royalties. We derive revenue from Franchise Restaurants in the form of (i) royalties and franchise fees; (ii) advertising contributions; and (iii) rental revenue from the properties that we lease to our Lease Management franchisees, in each case based on a percentage of sales reported by franchisees (see “—Our Business—Restaurant operations— _Types of franchise arrangements”). We also derive revenue from Company Restaurants in the form of_ direct sales.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Agreement”) whereby Quick Restaurants SA and Quick Services SAS granted France BKR a non-,18.10.2,Restaurant operations,"We have two distinct operating models for our Burger King restaurants: Franchise Restaurants and Company Restaurants, which represented approximately 83% and 17%, respectively, of our total restaurants as of June 30, 2021 compared to 75% and 25%, respectively, of our total restaurants as of December 31, 2018. _Franchise Restaurants_ For the Burger King brand, Franchise Restaurants generated €829.6 million in SWS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and 79% of our total SWS, compared to €670.8 million in SWS for the year ended December 31, 2020 when Burger King Franchise Restaurants represented 75% of our total SWS. For the Quick brand, Franchise Restaurants generated €31.9 million in SWS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and 3% of our total SWS, compared to €39.9 million in SWS for the year ended December 31, 2020 when Quick Franchise Restaurants represented 4% of our total SWS. For Burger King France, Franchise Restaurants generated €186.4 million in Group revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. _General franchise policy_ We have entered into an agreement with BKC, the owner of the Burger King brand, to act as master franchisee for the Burger King brand in France. We are therefore responsible for approving new franchisees in France. To that end, we are actively developing the brand and seeking strategic partners who have already gained significant business experience to expand our network. Our franchise operating model allows us to focus our resources on developing the brand with limited capital expenditures while working with our franchisees to promote Burger King restaurants as attractive and convenient dining destinations. Protecting the integrity and reputation of the Burger King brand is an important business goal. Before entering into a new agreement with a potential franchisee, we conduct certain due diligence procedures regarding the potential franchisee. As a general rule, we do not grant any of our franchisees the right to an exclusive territory. Our franchise agreements for Franchise with Lease Management are generally valid for a period of nine years from the date of execution (or restaurant opening, as the case may be) after which there is a twelve-month test period at the end of which the agreement is automatically renewed if certain cumulative conditions relating to the franchisee, its financial situation as well as compliance with the standards are met. The agreement can be renewed only once. If the conditions are not met during the above mentioned twelve-month period, the agreement terminates at the end of the first nine-year period. Our franchise agreements for Pure Franchises are generally entered into for a period of ten years and may continue up to a duration of twenty years. We encourage our franchisees to exhibit an entrepreneurial spirit and to take charge of their business investment, while at the same time supporting them in their operations and growth. As an integral part of our business, we have established a franchisee consultative committee which provides 169 ----- our franchisees with a forum where we may consult them on certain matters, such as advertising campaigns. While this committee has no decision-making or budget-setting power, it provides our franchisees with a further opportunity to maintain an open dialogue with the management of Burger King France. Franchisees are essential to the expansion of our network. We expect that after a franchisee has successfully demonstrated the ability to manage one restaurant, the franchisee should be able to successfully manage another, typically in the same area. When deciding to open a new restaurant in a particular area, we prefer to use existing franchisees that are already operating restaurants in that market. However, we do not anticipate that any franchisee would generally manage more than three to five restaurants, depending on the catchment area and business case. This allows us to benefit from and leverage the entrepreneurialism and restaurant experience of our current franchisees while avoiding becoming dependent on any particular franchisee. As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of 117 franchisees and 330 Franchise Restaurants in our Burger King network. Our largest franchisee operates eight restaurants. We may terminate our agreements with our franchisees for certain reasons, including failure to pay royalties and other fees and failure to operate the restaurant in accordance with our standards. As the ultimate holder of the Burger King brand, BKC may also direct us to terminate any of our franchise agreements under certain circumstances to protect the integrity of the Burger King brand. Our franchise agreements also contain certain provisions that prohibit the franchisee from operating another restaurant business that would compete directly with our business, or in a location where the restaurant would compete with an existing Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant. In addition, our agreements impose certain non-compete restrictions on our employees. For example, during the period of an employee’s employment contract and for six months after such contract has been terminated, an employee may not go and work in another Burger King restaurant. _Types of franchise arrangements_ We use two types of franchise arrangements: lease management arrangements (location _gérance) (“Franchise with Lease Management”) and traditional franchise arrangements (“Pure_",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Agreement”) whereby Quick Restaurants SA and Quick Services SAS granted France BKR a non-,18.10.3,,"exclusive and irrevocable license, with sub-licensable rights, of the Quick brand, which France BKR will use to continue to operate certain restaurants in France under the Quick brand until they are progressively converted to the Burger King brand, closed or sold, under certain agreed conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,"Franchise”), each of which is briefly described below. While the obligations under our Franchise with",18.11.1,,"Lease Management and Pure Franchise agreements are substantially similar, the main difference between the two arrangements concerns the business assets rights (fonds de commerce). In a Pure Franchise arrangement, the franchisee owns the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and as such is fully responsible for the operation of the business and its relevant expenses. However, in a Franchise with Lease Management arrangement, we maintain ownership of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and authorize the franchisee to operate the business assets rights (fonds de _commerce) in exchange for certain obligations. In addition, under our Pure Franchise arrangements the_ business goodwill ownership is held by the franchisee (and can be called at the option of the franchisor), whereas under our Lease Management arrangements the business goodwill ownership is held by Burger King France. Although we have historically used both types of franchise arrangements, we now focus on using Franchise with Lease Management arrangements for our Burger King franchise model and we intend to limit the entry into Pure Franchise arrangements, mainly for sites related to concessions such as airports, railway stations, or motorway service areas. The Franchise with Lease Management arrangement allows us to retain a higher degree of control over the network of restaurants, with limited capital expenditure, while at the same time benefiting from the local management expertise and capital outlay of the franchisee. Whenever we can, we shift existing Pure Franchise arrangements to a Franchise with Lease Management arrangement as we develop the Burger King brand in France. As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of 54 Pure Franchise Restaurants and 285 Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, compared to a total of 72 Pure Franchise Restaurants and 292 Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants as of December 31, 2018. We intend to continue to shift this trend towards Franchises with Lease Management as our network expands. 170 ----- _Franchise with Lease Management_ In a Franchise with Lease Management arrangement, the franchisee maintains contractual ties to us with both a franchise agreement and a tenancy agreement. Under this arrangement, we remain the owner of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and leasehold rights. In general, we are the tenant of record with respect to the restaurant real estate which we typically lease from third party landlords and we, in turn, lease the restaurant real estate to the franchisee. Franchise with Lease Management arrangements provide us with an enhanced ability to direct network density by proposing new locations to new or existing franchisees. This allows us to manage the rollout of the Burger King brand more closely. Under a Franchise with Lease Management agreement, the franchisee-lessee pays us for the use of the real estate through a percentage of restaurant sales, typically subject to a minimum yearly rent that coincides with our fixed costs under the relevant lease. In addition to these rent payments, the franchisee is also responsible for brand royalty payments and advertising contributions. These fees compensate us for the value of our business assets rights (fonds de commerce), which the franchisee operates, as well as for franchisee access to our know-how. We have chosen to use Franchise with Lease Management agreements as our preferred contractual arrangement for all of our Burger King franchisees going forward (to the extent feasible) to have the same contractual relationship with all of our franchisees and protect our business model by maintaining direct control over our restaurant locations. _Pure Franchise_ In a Pure Franchise arrangement, the franchisee is the tenant of record of the real estate where the franchisee operates the Franchise Restaurant. While we have ultimate decision power when choosing a new location for a restaurant, franchisees may propose a certain location that we may consider when deciding whether or not to open in a specific location. In addition, the franchisee is the owner of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and is solely responsible for the restaurant’s necessary capital expenditures. We enter into Pure Franchise arrangements in certain limited circumstances, for example in the event of a site concession that would prevent us from leasing the real estate ourselves, and have maintained certain of our historical Pure Franchise arrangements. In a Pure Franchise arrangement, franchisor revenue is primarily generated from royalty and license fees as the lease revenue stream is not present in this arrangement. _Royalties and Fees Paid by Franchisees_ When a franchisee opens or converts a restaurant to a new Burger King Franchise Restaurant, we charge a new franchise fee, a portion of which we maintain as compensation for our role as master franchisee. We pay BKC a portion of the new franchise fee to cover certain entrance fees owed in connection with the opening of each new Burger King Franchise Restaurant. We charge Burger King franchisees brand royalties generally equal to 9% of their sales (or 7% for concessions only for our Pure Franchise restaurants). Under the terms of the Master Franchise Agreement, we pay one half of this amount (i.e., 4.5% of sales) to BK Europe, the affiliate of BKC, leaving us with a net amount of 4.5% of sales in brand royalties. Our standard arrangement provides that Franchises with Lease Management pay rent equal to a percentage of their sales typically ranging from 10% to 14% depending on the level of sales. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these royalty fees have been temporarily adjusted. See _“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics”. As we are the tenant of record on the leases for Franchise Restaurants operated_ under Franchise with Lease Management arrangements, we directly pay the landlords for the use of these properties. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, pre-IFRS 16 leasehold and occupancy costs represented approximately 14% of our revenue, or 5% of the system wide sales, though rent is typically a fixed sum, except for certain shopping mall locations. 171 ----- In addition to brand royalties, we also expect our franchisees to actively participate in the development of the Burger King brand in France and to contribute to our marketing and advertising campaign. Burger King franchisees contribute an amount equal to 3.5% of sales to the national advertising fund that we manage, which, according to the Master Franchise Agreement and our own franchise agreements, is used exclusively for communication and advertising expenses. In addition to these advertising contributions, our franchisees must dedicate 1.5% of sales to local advertising, typically for their own account, for a total advertising cost per franchisee equal to 5% of sales. See “— _Group Operations—Marketing, advertising and promotions”. Company Restaurants_ In addition to Franchise Restaurants, we operate our own restaurants (“Company",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,"Restaurants”) to anchor our network, both in respect of key flagship locations and supply chain",18.12.1,,"management, as well as demonstrate the benefits of operating Burger King restaurants and diffuse know-how and innovations to current and potential franchisees. Company Restaurants also enable us to contribute to the generation of economies of scale with respect to supply chain negotiations and volume purchasing of food, equipment and other supplies. Additionally, Company Restaurants can be operated temporarily or for the medium-term until future franchisees are chosen or a current franchisee is ready to take possession of an additional Franchise Restaurant. We also intend to operate, directly or indirectly, ten remaining Quick restaurants pursuant to the Quick License Agreement, which we intend to convert to Burger King restaurants or definitively close in the short-term. As of June 30, 2021, we operated 73 Company Restaurants, including 69 Burger King restaurants and four Quick restaurants (comprising 18% of all restaurants), which generated €195.2 million of SWS for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Company Restaurants further represented 18% of Group revenue for the same period. We foresee the opening of a limited number of new Company Restaurants in order to favor the restaurants operated under Lease with Franchise Agreement arrangements. Our Burger King Company Restaurants are operated pursuant to a company franchise agreement that we entered into with BK Europe in 2013 (the “Company Franchise Agreement”). The Company Franchise Agreement replicates substantially all of the terms of our Master Franchise Agreement, with the exception of the remuneration that we pay BK Europe and a royalty fee generally representing 4.5% of restaurant sales per annum, which has historically changed during the term of the Company Franchise Agreement pursuant to agreed-upon annual milestones. The Company Franchise Agreement provides that these payments will incrementally increase throughout its duration. The Company Franchise Agreement contains substantially similar terms and conditions, including covenants to operate in compliance with defined operating protocols, and termination events to our Master Franchise Agreement. However, our rights under the Company Franchise Agreement are independent of our rights under the Master Franchise Agreement, and the termination of the latter does not automatically terminate our rights to operate our Company Restaurants in accordance with the Company Franchise Agreement. _Economics_ The percentage of EBITDA that we generate from each of Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants varies based on each arrangement. EBITDA generated from each type of arrangement as a percentage of ARS depends on the following: (i) for Company Restaurants, the EBITDA margin depends on the cost structure (including food and logistics costs, leasehold and occupancy costs and labor costs) and 4.5% of sales as a royalty to BK Europe; and (ii) for Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, we generate EBITDA on a post-IFRS 16 basis corresponding to approximately 16% of SWS (representing net royalties and lease and business asset fees. 172 ----- _Joint Venture Restaurants_ Certain of our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants, are operated through our 50/50 joint ventures with the Auchan Group, Agaquick and Agabk, which, together operate 25 restaurants. Agaquick has historically been focused on the conversion of Quick restaurants into the Burger King brand, while Agabk is focused on the opening of new Burger King restaurants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

As of June 30, 2021, 83% of our Burger King restaurants were Franchise Restaurants and 17% were Company Restaurants. We work with a total of 117 franchisees under the Burger King brand. Our average franchisee operates 2.8 restaurants and our largest franchisee operates eight restaurants. We also operate our restaurants across different formats and catchment areas including downtown areas, shopping centers and drive-through facilities. Each type has its own business model and produces different results overall. For example, on average, restaurants with drive-through facilities generate approximately 40% of their sales from their drive-through facilities and are often more profitable than other restaurant types as the rents are typically lower and require lower operating expenses.

See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party _Transactions”._ We consider the location of a restaurant to be critical to its long-term success and as such we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential locations for both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. We have developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process that incorporates our management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. Our restaurant development team has extensive experience identifying and evaluating suitable restaurant locations. On average, the period from site selection to the start of construction is approximately 18 months. Our site selection process for both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants includes extensive data collection, strategic mapping and competitive analysis. We seek new restaurant locations based on specific criteria, such as intrinsic demographic characteristics and expected 173 ----- demographic trends relating to a potential location, the presence of one or several of our major competitors or indirect competitors, the catchment area, the known success of other retail brands already present in the area, the residential density thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. Each of these identification criteria is supported by our developed know-how. Following this initial “experience-based” assessment, our development and management teams assess the development costs of each site based on various factors, including the site’s complexity, size and location. The management team develops an estimate of the potential revenue for each identified site based on known local market trends and conditions and relies on estimated data such as the success rates of our major direct or indirect competitors in the vicinity. This enables our development and management teams, who meet on a weekly basis, to assess the potential return on investment and cash conversion rates of a restaurant at each new site identified. Thereafter management makes a physical visit to a potential site before a final decision is made to adapt a specific site. Our Managing Director and Deputy Managing Director are actively involved in the site selection process. Further work may be carried out on a potential site, including the appointment of marketing and footfall consultants to assess customer flow and market factors. Our development and management teams continue to compile and review information on a potential site up to the date a lease is signed. If any negative information on the proposed site or area is discovered during this time, the management team may choose not to proceed with developing a particular site.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Opening a new Burger King restaurant has a cost of approximately €2.4 million of capital expenditure, including real estate and the costs the franchisees are responsible for (as further described below), although these costs may vary across geographical regions. We may share such costs with our franchisees depending on the type of franchise arrangement. In a Pure Franchise agreement, our franchisees are solely responsible for all costs associated with opening a new restaurant. When one of our Franchise with Lease Management partners opens a new restaurant, the franchisee is responsible for the kitchen equipment, seating, lighting and some other decor-related features, which amounts to a total of between €750,000 to €910,000. These costs exclude staff wages up until opening day, recruitment costs, training costs, accommodation and transportation for staff and various marketing initiatives in order to promote the opening which our franchisees incur in addition to their investment. Capital expenditures that are not paid by the franchisees are totally or partially supported by the landlord or a real estate company. Our asset light operating model allows us to develop and expand our network without involving corporate capital expenditures, or where expenditures are necessary, limiting them to some technical fittings and leasehold improvements. Management has engaged with potential lenders, educating them about the case for lending to Burger King franchisees in France. The consistently strong performance following the opening of a Burger King restaurant helps to provide comfort to potential lenders and allows our franchisees easier access to the necessary funds. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, we operated 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand compared to approximately 1,500 restaurants for our main competitor, McDonald’s (as of June 2021). In light of these figures, which demonstrate a strong market potential, and as the master franchisee for the Burger King brand in France, we aim to further expand our Burger King network in France, including through our franchise restaurants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The performance of our Franchise Restaurants is also closely monitored by our franchisees, who are primarily responsible for monitoring the performance of their respective Franchise Restaurant(s). We receive regular financial reporting by franchisees which assists us in monitoring performance and forecasting new development in similar locations. In addition, according to our franchise agreements, we have the right to review the financial information of our Franchise Restaurants upon request. We have implemented reporting procedures and IT systems that enable us to monitor the sales, labor and food costs for each of our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants on a daily basis. See “—Information Systems”. We actively manage underperforming Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants by making operational changes (such as deploying new managers), and in the case of our Company Restaurants, increasing local advertising to improve visibility of the location and occasionally, incurring additional capital expenditures, such as refurbishment costs.

See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party _Transactions”._ On average, 24 months is required from the identification of a site for a new Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant until the new Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant is ready to open for business. The majority of this time is dedicated to carrying out due diligence regarding the potential site as described above and the negotiation and signing of a lease. This time period includes the average time required to obtain the necessary permits and carry out pre-opening training at the new location. A significant portion of this process is related to obtaining the necessary construction permits when we are planning to build a new restaurant. In our experience, obtaining a construction permit from local authorities may take up to five months. While we are able to expedite this process under certain circumstances, the preliminary approval process imposes a significant delay and must be completed before we are able to begin other aspects of opening a new restaurant. However, the actual timeframe for the development of a new Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant will vary based on site specific considerations such as whether the location is newly constructed or converted from an existing space. Management directly oversees each step of the development process that prepares a new Company Restaurant or Franchise Restaurant for operation. In 2020, we successfully developed one new Company Restaurant and 19 new Franchise Restaurants under the Burger King brand. In addition, during 2020, we successfully converted nine Quick restaurants to Burger King brand restaurants (of which four and five as Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants respectively). During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we successfully developed 15 new Franchise Restaurants under the Burger King brand.

In order to reinforce awareness of the Burger King brand, build on our image and generate footfall, we invest annually in innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns at the national level, essentially promoting our new products. Our SWS and results of operations can be significantly affected by the frequency and effectiveness of our advertising and promotional programs. On September 23, 2021, Grand Prix Stratégies awarded us, along with our advertising agency Buzzman, number one in most of the key categories of communication during the COVID-19 crisis, including the Grand Prix Advertising and Special Grand Prix of the Jury awards for the “Burger King and Friends” communication, the Grand Prix Media Strategy award for communication during the pandemic and the Grand Prix Digital Communication award for our “Lockdown Burgers” program. Burger King is the first brand to receive all of these awards simultaneously. The terms of our franchise agreements require our Burger King franchisees to contribute 3.5% of sales to our national advertising fund, which finances our marketing, advertising and promotions initiatives and programs. In addition, franchisees must spend at least 1.5% of sales on advertising at the local level in their respective markets. See “—Our Business—Restaurant operations”. We use three levels of advertising: (i) system-wide advertising, which is coordinated and centralized in our headquarters outside of Paris; (ii) digital and social media advertising; and (iii) local advertising, which franchisees handle with materials we create or approve. Franchisees may not use their own advertising materials without our prior consent. We must obtain BKC’s prior approval for all of our marketing, advertising and promotional programs and initiatives. _System-wide advertising programs_ Our Burger King Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants must contribute 3.5% of sales to our coordinated and centralized system-wide advertising programs. We employ all manner of media to reach our target audience, including families and young adults. We direct and retain sole control over all advertising and promotions financed through contributions made by Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. We use a national advertising agency to create our advertising and promotional materials. _Digital and social media advertising_ We currently use an extensive range of social media, television and digital marketing tools, which we have prioritized and significantly developed in recent years. We create videos for sharing on social media outlets such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, which we believe are the most effective ways to reach our customers. In addition, we manage the development and maintenance of the mobile Burger King app, which we have expanded to include additional features, including Click & Collect in-app ordering and our customer loyalty program.

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.17,Group Operations,18.17.2,Procurement and logistics,"_Raw materials supply_ All Burger King restaurants independently purchase supplies for their needs from approved suppliers through our approved logistic partner(s). These purchases include food products and the paper and packaging materials for the sale of our products as well as cleaning supplies and other products for the maintenance of equipment. Pursuant to our franchise agreements, Burger King operations are required to source raw materials from BKC-approved suppliers. We are able to tap into the network of BKC-approved suppliers both in France and in additional European markets, in particular Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, where approved suppliers in those countries have in the past, and are able to provide us with approved raw materials on a regular basis, subject to their capacities. As we have expanded our network of Burger King Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants, we have developed a significant French network of approved suppliers, securing access to supplies while reducing transport costs. The development of our network is beneficial to the overall success of the Burger King brand as our suppliers will be able to source other Burger King markets in the event of a shortage or other interruption in the supply chain. We anticipate that the locally sourced component of our raw materials from French suppliers will continue to increase along with the growth of the Burger King network. In order to improve and optimize our supply chain and achieve lower prices, we focus particularly on implementing an efficient sourcing and food management policy through optimization of the procurement process and product development at both the recipe level and overall product offer level. We have developed relationships with a number of high-quality suppliers to source the ingredients we need. We use a limited number of suppliers for each ingredient to obtain high volume discounts and maximize the service level the business receives (backed up by contingency solutions) and only use a small number of suppliers in order to control and guarantee quality. We also optimize food costs by reducing waste and by focusing on food losses (for example, through our “Have it Your Way” model and “made to order” model, through which customers can customize their menu items and food is prepared only after a customer places an order, providing customers with fresh foods and limiting waste). We have implemented a purchasing strategy for raw materials which allows us to obtain price commitments from suppliers by giving them mid- to long-term visibility on volumes and growth in France. Moreover, we have entered into forward buying contracts with our suppliers, except for beef, which limit our exposure to any short-term fluctuations in food prices. A typical forward buying contract provides for fixed prices for at least six months. In addition, we entered into mid- to long-term contracts with our strategic suppliers for beef, French fries, buns, chicken and beverages. This strategy allows us to have pricing visibility and minimize the impact of fluctuations in food and supply prices on our operations for the duration of these contracts. Beef is a key ingredient in our product offerings. We have developed a dedicated strategy for beef supply management optimization in order to mitigate the effect of the global upward pricing trend on the beef market. The purchase of beef accounted from approximately 20 to 25% of our raw material 177 ----- costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we have a limited number of beef suppliers (eight approved suppliers as of 2020) which are strictly required to purchase beef only from EU approved establishments and a limited number of countries of origin (France, Germany and Austria). Our beef is exclusively sourced from Europe, more than 50% of which comes from France. We intend to continue to select our suppliers and track our raw material sourcing using very strict processes, which include supplier selection criteria based on quality control, financial situation, production capacity (ability to handle both large volumes and flexible production), emergency back-up capabilities, as well as strength in research and development. _Logistics_ For the Burger King brand, procurement and logistics activities are outsourced and handled by QSL-STEF, a joint venture of QSL and STEF dedicated to the QSR sector. QSL-STEF purchases our food supplies and other raw materials from various suppliers. We contractually set certain targets and goals with QSL-STEF, which monitors our inventories and packaging in addition to ensuring that goods and materials reach our restaurants from their point of origin at an optimal cost and service level. Franchisees order their raw materials and supplies directly from QSL-STEF as an approved vendor. QSL-STEF serves as a third-party and fourth-party logistics provider for us, coordinating the logistics of our third-party providers and is also responsible for the warehousing and related storage from the suppliers. Under the terms of agreements with the suppliers, QSL-STEF becomes the owner of these products once they reach third-party warehouses with whom it has contracted to provide such warehousing services. Storage and distribution of food items and operational supplies to all restaurants (Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants) is subcontracted to a third-party logistics provider (STEF). As we rely on QSL-STEF for coordinating logistics for all of our restaurants, we are able to negotiate favorable terms as a block and provide our Franchise Restaurants with the ability to achieve preferential price points, improving their overall results of operations. Our team in our headquarters located at Clichy, France monitors the logistics and distribution to our Company Restaurants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

We also offer a limited range of chicken nuggets and chicken wings. Our menu includes French fries, onion rings, freshly prepared salads, breakfast options, soft drinks, milk shakes, ice cream and other desserts, coffee, tea and kids’ meals. In recent years, we have further developed and improved our product range to better respond to changing consumer preferences through the launch of gourmet burgers with premium ingredients, plant-based burger options and additional healthy menu items such as fresh bowls. Our price positioning seeks to be competitive with our main competitor, McDonald’s, but adds more extensive “premiumization” options through high quality ingredients or additional toppings. Our product offering and price point is comparable to those of our main competitor, McDonald’s. While we have a more expansive premium offering than our main competitor, we pride ourselves on offering a wide range of products comparable to our competitors’ offering. We also test new products on an ongoing basis and develop geographical variations and specific sandwiches for the French market. In addition, our restaurants sell a variety of promotional products for a limited time only. When we decide to add a new product to our menu, we must use BKC approved suppliers for the ingredients. If we decide to permanently add a new product to our menu, we 178 ----- are required to obtain BKC’s authorization.

Quality, choice and nutrition are increasingly important to our customers and we are continuously evaluating and evolving our menu to meet our customers’ needs. Our “Have it Your Way” model allows customers the ability to customize our menu items to order only the ingredients they want to eat. Beyond the menu we offer our customers, we also innovate on production processes and methods in our kitchens, invest in new equipment and optimize work organization in order to deliver the best dining experience to our customers. For example, our broiler system provides our hamburgers with a unique flavor that promotes our products and differentiates us from our main competitor. We are also focused on accelerating our innovation in terms of digital convenience options for our customers. For example, in 2020 we launched a new Burger King app with the ability to order Click & Collect directly through the app, as well as improved the drive-through digital experience by accelerating the order process through the use of digital tablets in our drive-through sites. In the same year, we also launched Kingdom, a new digital loyalty program, allowing customers to earn rewards through their purchases, which they are able to accumulate through scanner capabilities for easy customer identification. In 2019 and 2020, we have also expanded food delivery options through our partnerships for delivery services with Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo.

As franchisor, the relationships formed with franchisees and the interaction between us, our franchisees and end-customers throughout the course of the value chain, are intended to increase franchisees’ sales. We believe that our model helps our franchisees to realize positive net returns. _Service, delivery and pricing_ Franchisees are provided with extensive materials and training on how to organize, manage and monitor service delivery in their restaurants, including best practices that have been developed by BKC for worldwide use. For example, our manuals assist franchisees in organizing the taking and dispatch of orders, for in-restaurant dining, take-away and drive-through, and work force scheduling management during peak hours. Additionally, we recommend prices using a tiered approach for all products, though franchisees are independent entrepreneurs and are free to adjust their pricing as local conditions or their own business reasons may dictate. _Training, pre-opening assistance and ongoing support_ Franchisees (along with their manager(s)) must attend and successfully complete a training program before we will issue an opening date for a Franchise Restaurant. Our training program covers various topics, including: Burger King culture, food preparation and storage, food safety, specific position training, uniforms, cleaning and sanitation, marketing and advertising, point-of-sale systems, accounting and hospitality, among others. We require our franchisees to live within one hour of their respective restaurant(s) and require them to hire a restaurant manager who either resides in the area where the restaurant is located or is willing to move to this area. 179 ----- When a franchisee opens his or her first Franchise Restaurant, we provide the franchisee with certain operational support during the initial operating days including training employees and providing guidance and tips for operating a restaurant in compliance with our standards. We also provide lists of approved inventory, suppliers and small-wares that are needed to stock and operate each restaurant and help franchisees locate qualified suppliers of raw materials and other supplies and ingredients that meet our specifications. We maintain programs to monitor and evaluate the adherence of Franchise Restaurants to our quality, service and cleanliness standards. We also closely monitor financial data of each Franchise Restaurant, including revenue, sales and profits. In addition, we are responsible for communicating and conveying certain initiatives and process enhancements to our franchisees and conducting business reviews in order to assist franchisees to operate more efficiently, increase the Franchise Restaurant’s performance, sales and profits and stimulate Franchise Restaurant’s footfall and visibility. See “—Our _Network—Restaurant monitoring and reporting”._ In addition to our hands-on training and assistance, we provide an operations manual to each restaurant location that addresses business operations, food safety, crew, hospitality, quality products, guest services, packaging and presentation, restaurant cleaning, restaurant and equipment maintenance, point-of-sale systems, quality control, advertising and marketing and emergency management. See “—Quality Assurance and Food Safety”. _Point-of-sale system_ We require our franchisees to use a unique proprietary third-party restaurant software developed exclusively for Burger King and that allows us to track sales at each Franchise Restaurant location. Furthermore, a point-of-sale system provides our franchisees with additional back office tools that we believe assist in cost control, create operational efficiencies and drive sales. _Supply chain assistance_ We and our franchisees rely on QSL-STEF to manage our supply chain and provide us with the necessary raw materials, commodities and other items needed to develop and operate our restaurants. We coordinate directly with QSL-STEF to manage the supply chain as it relates to our Company Restaurants and our franchisees work directly with QSL-STEF to manage their own supply chain. See “Business—Group Operations—Procurement and Logistics”. _Research and development_ We benefit from and rely on the product development capabilities of our Burger King network to drive sales.

We benefit from BKC’s strong experience and knowledge of quality assurance and food safety standards and procedures. 180 ----- In order to ensure that high quality standards are maintained and to adhere to BKC’s standards and procedures on quality assurance and food safety, we have developed a strong hygiene culture and have established a reliable control track record, with stringent standards which can even go beyond the requirements under French legal regulations. Such standards apply to all our Burger King restaurants. See “Regulation” for a description of the laws and regulations that govern food safety and hygiene in our operations. No food contamination incident has been attributed to our restaurants since Groupe Bertrand (through Burger King France) entered into the Master Franchise Agreement or acquired the Quick brand. Our quality control department is fully dedicated to monitoring and enforcing quality assurance and food safety standards and procedures and managing any quality or food safety issue across our entire supply chain from production, to transportation and storage to end-delivery. We have implemented a detailed food safety manual that covers all aspects of cleaning, food handling and storage, pest control, stock control and waste disposal. We also have rigorous food safety procedures based on a hazard analysis and critical control points plan, which includes controls and monitoring for key processes such as receiving food deliveries, defrosting, cooking, cooling and storage. This includes stringent guidelines on date labelling, allergen labelling, refrigerator plans and temperature checks. In addition, we use specific cleaning products to maintain hygiene and food safety and we communicate an allergen list through leaflets, posters in restaurants and on our website. Any breach of our quality assurance and food safety rules by a restaurant is sanctioned and is factored into the restaurant manager’s compensation. For Franchise Restaurants, non-compliance with our quality assurance and food safety rules is grounds for termination under our franchise agreements. We review our safety governance policy on an ongoing basis at the restaurant, area and group level. All restaurant employees receive training on critical aspects of food safety as part of their hiring process and also complete a food safety course. Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants team members receive ongoing training regarding sanitary procedures, and all senior personnel and managers are required to complete food safety qualifications administered by us. Senior operations management may also seek to attain further food safety qualifications. We inspect both our Company Restaurants and our Franchise Restaurants on a quarterly basis. We perform audits on the procedures in place in Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants to ensure that food is being correctly handled. In addition, we have a contract with an independent lab to perform bacteriological tests in our restaurants. BKC also conducts inspections on a quarterly basis in order to verify that its requirements are being respected. We consider adherence to our food safety policy to be one of our top priorities and may terminate our relationships with franchisees who fail to respect these standards.

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.18,Real Estate,18.18.1,,"Under our historic Pure Franchise agreements, we did not systematically directly lease the real estate underlying Franchise Restaurants. In connection with the continued development of the Burger King brand in France, we have decided to enter into Franchise with Lease Management agreements with our franchisees going forward to streamline our operating structure by using one contractual arrangement with all of our franchisees that provides us with greater control over our network. As of June 30, 2021, 277 of our Burger King Franchise Restaurants were operated under lease management arrangements. Under this scheme, we remain the owner of the business assets rights (fonds de commerce) and leasehold rights, while the franchisee is the owner of all equipment and signage that they purchase in connection with operating the restaurant. As we are the tenant of record with respect to the restaurant real estate, this arrangement allows us to limit the possibility of losing a location within our network to a competitor without our consent. We then enter into an agreement with the franchisee to sign a lease management agreement, who in turn pays us a percentage of sales in rent payments while we directly pay the landlord. These locations are leased under commercial lease agreements (baux commerciaux) that we enter into with the landlords. For a brief description of the 181 ----- principal terms of our commercial lease agreements, see “—Restaurant operations—Franchise _Restaurants—Franchise with Lease Management”._ We lease the real estate of our Company Restaurants from third parties. All Company Restaurants are subject to commercial leases or ground leases. The following provides a brief description of these arrangements. Commercial leases have a minimum initial duration of nine years to twelve years. The lessee has the right to terminate a commercial lease at the end of each three-year period. The lessor may only terminate the lease at the conclusion of each three-year period in certain limited circumstances. At the end of the contractual term of the lease, the lessee is entitled to a renewal. If the lessor refuses such renewal, the lessor will be required to compensate the lessee, unless the lessor can show good cause. Upon expiration of the lease agreement, if the lessor and lessee take no action to renew or to terminate the lease, the original lease will be automatically renewed until either the lessor or the lessee serves a notice of termination. An automatically renewed lease may be terminated at any time by either the lessor or the lessee provided that six months’ prior notice is given. In addition to our commercial leases, we maintain certain ground leases for some of our older properties which have a typical duration of 30 years. The parties to a commercial lease are free to determine the initial rent, generally according to the current market value of the property at the signing of the contract. The rent may be fixed, variable or composed of a fixed portion and a variable portion. Generally, the lease contains an annual rent indexation clause. The agreed index must have some connection with the activity carried out by one of the parties or to the purpose of the lease. The majority of our leases are based on the Commercial Rent Index (ILC) (indice des loyers commerciaux) published by _l’Institut national de la statistique et des _études économiques (INSEE), the French public statistics institute._",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

As franchisees are independent business owners, they and their employees are not included in our employee count. We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our major competitors. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. In France, a collective bargaining framework agreement is in place for the QSR sector that sets, among other things, annual working times, employee holiday time and overtime pay and employee leaving conditions. In addition, there is a limited number of trade unions that are recognized as representatives and given the legal authority to appoint trade union delegates, and to negotiate additional company-specific collective bargaining agreements. Some of our employees are members of these trade unions. We place significant emphasis on staff training, which we believe is key to maintaining high standards of quality across our business. We provide comprehensive in-house training to all employees, which we extend to Franchise Restaurant staff through a number of training initiatives to actively support and foster employee development and retention at Franchise Restaurants. Our training focuses on health and safety issues for restaurant-based employees, and we also provide food-hygiene training and food retail management to managers of both Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants. In addition, we regularly encourage our franchisees and their employees to visit our Company Restaurants in order to demonstrate new equipment, menu items, workflow practices and ensure that all franchisees and their employees are trained to a consistent standard.

We therefore source a wide range of ingredients locally from France. As of June 30, 2021, 75% of the food products we purchase come from French agri-food companies, as compared to 10% five years ago. Further, our beef is exclusively sourced from Europe, more than 50% of which comes from France, and our nuggets are exclusively sourced in France, from poultry born and raised in compliance with programs that promote the environment and respect for animal welfare. In addition, 100% of our potatoes for fries, flour for buns and fresh onions are sourced from France, as well as the raw vegetables and fruits included in our children’s menus, which are 100% organic and sourced from France. We further aim to minimize the footprint of our products with a focus on our ingredients and product offerings. Through our ingredients, we are committed to providing seasonal fruits, MSC-certified fish, and organic ingredients in kid meals. We believe driving the adoption of meatless proteins is one of the most impactful ways that we can contribute to the reduction in the carbon footprint of our industry. As a result, we started developing and marketing plant-based offerings and currently offer 7 meatless protein products. Providing our customers with healthy dining options is at the heart of our food innovation philosophy. We have focused on implementing policies to protect consumer health, including through improving the nutritional profile and ingredients of our products and developing product ranges for specific nutritional requirements. We have achieved significant results in recent years by implementing improvements across many of our ingredients and dishes. For example, we are committed to sugar and salt reduction. In 2019, we reduced the level of sugar in our drinks by 6%, and in 2020, we reduced the level of salt in our potatoes by 50%. Further, we have been palm oil free since 2019. We have also eliminated artificial colors, flavors and preservatives throughout all our menus and meal options. Moreover, we also continue to invest in customer choice, by proposing new products in order to satisfy most of our clients’ tastes such as low calorie salads, wraps, vegan and vegetarians options. Since our products are developed in France, we have guaranteed our customers access to nutritional information, as well as information on product allergens on our site, our application and in restaurants to allow customers to make an informed choice within our offer. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to help ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products by conducting strict internal control over food safety across our network. We maintain strict controls over the food supply chain to guarantee product safety, regulatory compliance and to assure the quality standards of our restaurants. For these purposes, we have implemented supplier controls, production controls and a system of food safety verification. For example, raw materials are controlled by an external laboratory to ensure proper compliance with all food safety criteria. We are also able to trace the distribution of raw materials from our production facilities or suppliers. We have implemented rigorous control protocols over all our restaurants, which are subject to bi-monthly hygiene audits performed by an external independent accredited laboratory.

In 2020, 51% of our employees were women. Since 2019, the Penicaud index, a gender equality index introduced under the French law no. 2019-15 of January 8, 2019, has applied to all companies in France with more than 50 employees. The index provides an optimal score of 100, calculated on the basis of five indicators, including, for example, the gender pay gap and differences in distribution of individual salary increases. In 2020, our Burger King France operations achieved a Penicaud index score greater than 85, above the compliance threshold of 75. We aim to maintain this equality in the future and to prioritize gender equality in our management teams in our branch restaurants. We have also adopted a policy for harassment and bullying at work in our restaurants, as well as an incident reporting platform to address such occurrences. We recognize the importance of inclusion and consider the diversity of our team as one of our greatest strengths. Therefore, we focus on growing employment for individuals with disabilities to promote inclusion. As a result of changing French regulations, we now use a new calculation method for our employment rate of workers with disabilities. In 2019, we had an employment rate ratio of 5.2%. Using the new calculation, in 2020, our percentage decreased to 3.2% which is compared to 2.6% on average for the restaurant sector in France. This has been a driving force in our decision to redeploy a more ambitious inclusion policy. Training is the cornerstone of our operational excellence. We provide continuous investment in our training teams. For example, we require a minimum of 50 hours of training per employee, 9 weeks for managers and 18 weeks for directors to offer career growth, retain talent and maintain high service quality.

Our environmental initiatives are built on three key pillars: the reduction of the impact of (i) our real estate footprint, (ii) our waste and (iii) our logistics. To mitigate our real estate footprint we have used PEFC-certified wooden frames for all new buildings since 2019. Furthermore, we participate in trial initiatives, for example, rooftop energy collection, CO2 cooling, optimized lighting and car charging points. We are committed to reducing waste and implementing eco-friendly packaging. Our environmentally-friendly packaging has helped us avoid approximately 700 tons per year of plastic waste. To this end, we have banned our usage of single-use plastic from our service packaging in favor of paper solutions. Our kids cups are now plastic-free and compostable. In addition, since 2020, toys are no longer systematically distributed with kids menus, leading to 10% of such menus being sold without any toys. Since 2021, we have gradually removed plastic from our toys, and we aim to become full plastic free in 2022. In addition, we have deployed a plan to massively reduce waste with the objective of avoiding 1,700 tons of waste per year. For example, we have replaced the boxes of our kids menus and delivery boxes with bags that represented half their weight. We have introduced packaging systems that do not require a lid and we have also reduced the size of our cashier’s receipts. Furthermore, we began waste sorting in 2020, and selective waste collection initiatives in 2021. Moreover, we are committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the fight against climate change. For example, in 2019 we optimized our truck load by improving the filling rate of our trucks for a 15% reduction in route mileage. This allows our truck fleet to meet a strict criteria in terms of polluting gas emissions (in line with the Euro 6 European emissions standards).

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Food and Beverage Regulations,58.1.1,Food safety and hygiene,"_European Union_ The reform of the EU regulations on food hygiene, which came into force on January 1, 2006, simplified and harmonized the previously existing food hygiene legislation applicable in the European Union. The reformed set of regulations, known as the “Hygiene Package”, concerns the entire food chain, from primary production (both animal and plant) to the consumer, and includes the food industry, transport and distribution (“from farm to fork”). Its aim is to standardize the level of food safety by involving all stakeholders in the food chain and subjecting them to uniform requirements, by formalizing the requirements of food-industry professionals and optimizing enforcement by the health authorities. Food safety and hygiene regulations and directives promulgated by the EU have an impact on our business because we conduct substantially all of our activities in France, which is a member state of the EU. The main food safety regulator at the EU level is the European Food Safety Authority (the “EFSA”), which was established in 2002 by Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, as amended and supplemented (the “General Food Law Regulation”), which is the key text of the Hygiene Package. The EFSA assesses and communicates risks associated with the food chain in order to inform the policies and decisions of food safety risk managers. The General Food Law Regulation lays down the general principles and requirements of food safety legislation to be implemented into national law by all member states of the EU. In particular, the General Food Law Regulation requires food business operators to ensure that businesses under their control satisfy relevant requirements and to verify that such requirements are met at all stages of production, processing and distribution. It also imposes a mandatory traceability requirement along the entire food chain that applies to all food and all types of operators in the processing, transportation, storage, distribution and retail stages, among others. Each food operator is required to register and keep for a reasonable period of time (the guidance of the Standing Committee states that five years is a reasonable time) detailed product information (including the name and address of the producer, the nature of the product and the transaction date) and make such records immediately available to competent authorities upon request. As part of the Hygiene Package, we are also subject to other specific European food hygiene legislation under Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 of April 29, 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, which applies to all food businesses, and defines general hygiene rules applicable to all foodstuffs, and to Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 of April 29, 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for the hygiene of 186 ----- foodstuffs of animal origin (together, the “EU Hygiene Regulations”). The EU Hygiene Regulations require that we obtain and maintain hazard analysis and critical control point (“HACCP”) certification, including instructing employees in this regard and conducting appropriate record-keeping. HACCP is a systematic preventive approach used in the food industry to identify potential food safety hazards, so that key actions (known as critical control points) may be taken to reduce or eliminate risks, while considering all key aspects of product manufacturing, from the safety of the raw materials, to process validation (for example, cooking and washing), to shelf life and finally end-consumer usage. In addition, the EU Hygiene Regulations include more stringent requirements for food products of animal origin, such as meat, fish and dairy products, and food containing such products. European legislation regulates the temperature settings at which these products must be kept as well as the length of time for which they can be displayed. A number of subsequent regulations that serve as implementing texts of the Hygiene Package have also been enacted, certain of which are applicable in our operations. These regulations lay out specific criteria and requirements for compliance with the Hygiene Package, as well as consequences for non-compliance. _France_ In France, the principal food safety regulator is the Agency for Food, Environment and Occupational Health and Safety (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de _l’environnement et du travail, or the “ANSES”). The ANSES provides the relevant authorities with the_ necessary expertise in order to set national-level regulations concerning, among other subjects: hygiene rules applicable to the retailing, storage and transport of products of animal origin and food containing such products; technical and hygiene conditions applicable to the transport of foodstuffs; and licensing of establishments that bring to market products of animal origin or food containing such products. In addition, French food safety regulation requires each establishment that brings to market products of animal origin or food containing such products to obtain an official authorization. Further, we are subject to several provisions of the French Rural and Maritime Fishing Code (Code rural et de la pêche _maritime), as amended, dealing, among others, with food safety epidemiology concerns related to_ products of animal origin and animal feed, and animal health.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.1,Food and Beverage Regulations,58.1.2,Food Labelling and Nutrition,"Food labelling, particularly as it relates to nutritional content, involves the accurate and precise labelling of the energy and nutritional content of a food product on its product packaging. It is an increasingly regulated tool that is intended to help customers in their food choices and to support public health policy measures. Our products are subject to Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of October 25, 2011 on the provision of information to customers (the “Food Labelling Regulation”), which replaced and consolidated into one piece of legislation previous labelling rules deriving from Directive 2000/13/EC regarding labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling of foodstuffs, and other legislative acts for specific categories of foods. The Food Labelling Regulation, which introduced key changes such as mandatory nutrition disclosure on processed foods and amendments to nutrition labelling format, entered into force on December 13, 2014 (save for the obligation to provide nutrition information applicable from December 13, 2016). Successive amendments to the Food Labelling Regulations, including various EU and French implementation regulations, have since been adopted on various subjects, including the indication of the country of origin for certain types of meat and other ingredients, nutritional and health claims made with respect to food products and the labeling of additional vitamins, minerals and other substances in food ingredients. For example, Regulation (EU) 2018/775 lays down rules for the application of Article 26(3) of the Food Labelling Regulation. It sets out guidelines for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food product, providing that if the origin or provenance of a product’s primary ingredient is different to the origin or provenance currently indicated on the label of a food, food services providers will have to provide additional information on 187 ----- packaging regarding the origin of the primary ingredient or ingredients. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure that customers are not misled about the origin of a product’s ingredients. In recent years, national and local authorities have begun reinforcing such food labelling regulations and requirements motivated by concerns regarding nutrition and environmental sustainability. These measures have included, among others, greater emphasis on food labelling and disclosure of nutritional content, requirements to utilize recyclable packaging materials, and additional taxes on food and beverage items with high sugar content. For example, specific French legislation regulates the labelling of beef in restaurant establishments (Decree no. 2002-1465 of December 17, 2002). In addition, there has been increasing regulatory scrutiny over the disclosure of allergens present in prepared food products. For example, French legislation (Decree No. 2015-447 of April 17, 2015) regulates consumer information on allergens. Pursuant to such regulation, allergenic substances present in both prepackaged and non-prepackaged products must be pointed out in the list of ingredients. In the coming years, we expect additional regulations pertaining to food labelling to be enacted. For example, the European Commission is contemplating the introduction of uniform mandatory nutrition labelling laws for the front of food packaging by the end of 2022, in addition to the mandatory labelling already imposed on the back of food packaging. The proposed labelling could take a form analogous to the Nutri-Score used today in France. Under the current timetable for the European Commission’s “Green Deal”, regulations are expected to set maximum levels of certain nutrients in food products and to establish uniform nutritional profiles by the end of 2021, as well as to limit certain communication around products rich in sugar, salt and fat by 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The law enacting the Beverage Tax came into force on January 1, 2012. The Beverage Tax, initially set at €7.16 per hundred liters, is reassessed annually based on the consumer price index (excluding tobacco) and must be paid by any person or entity located in France that makes the first delivery of such beverages in France, either because it produces the beverages, or because it imports or purchases them from any person or entity located outside of France, whether or not for consideration. The Beverage Tax was amended by the draft social security financing law for 2018, which was adopted on October 27, 2017, in order to link the amount of Beverage Tax to be paid to the quantity of added-sugar substances contained in such beverages. Since then, the amounts have been reassessed each year. As of June 12, 2021, the rate of tax on beverages containing added-sugar is determined according to a progressive scale which ranges from €3.11 per hundred liters for one kilogram or less of added-sugar per hundred liters, to €24.34 for a beverage containing 15 kilograms of added-sugar per hundred liters. For beverages containing over 15 kilograms of added-sugar per hundred liters, the tax is increased by €2.07 per additional kilogram of added-sugar. In addition, as of June 12, 2021, all beverages containing one or more artificial sweeteners are subject to a tax of €3.11 per hundred liters.

We are also required to enforce anti-smoking laws for dining establishments. 188 ----- _Regulations against waste and the circular economy_ In July 2014, the European Commission published the so-called “waste package”, aimed at amending several EU directives (i.e., four directives amended on May 30, 2018) and at introducing new waste targets, with the focus on resource efficiency and a circular economy. To transpose this directive, France passed Law no. 2020-105 on February 10, 2020. This new law, which fights against waste and the circular economy, introduced new measures aiming to encourage reuse and recycling and improve consumer information on environmental attributes of products and their packaging (the “AGEC Law”). Furthermore, the AGEC law confirms and extends the role of extended producer responsibility (“EPR”). The EPR requires producers, importers and distributors of products to either provide or financially contribute to the management of the waste generated by their products. _Regulation for the reduction of the use of certain single-use plastic products_ The European Parliament and the Council of June 5, 2019 published Directive 2019/904 (the “Single-Use Plastics Directive”). The Single-Use Plastics Directive promotes approaches that favor sustainable and non-toxic re-usable products and re-use systems instead of single-use products. Furthermore, the European Commission has published guidance on single-use plastics products to ensure uniformity in implementing the Single-Use Plastics Directive across the European Union. In France, the AGEC law aims to end the use of single-use plastic packaging by 2040. Plastic cups and plates were banned beginning on January 1, 2020. Plastic straws, confetti, cutlery and polystyrene take-away boxes were banned beginning on January 1, 2021. In addition, as of January 1, 2023, fast-food restaurants will be obliged to use reusable tableware for the meals and drinks consumed on site by their customers. The AGEC extended the EPR sector to cover toys in France. Plastic toys are often offered in the catering sector with some of their menus. However, the plastic toys are not recyclable and often end up in the waste bin. Therefore, as of January 1, 2022, the law provides for the prohibition of plastic toys supplied with some kids menus. As a result, plastic toys are expected to be made optional in kids menus. _Selective sorting regulation_ In addition, in France, Decree no. 2016-288 of March 10, 2016, governs waste management in the workplace. This requires selective sorting according to the five streams identified in the regulation. The five streams include types of recyclable waste (paper, metal, plastic, glass and wood) that must be sorted by all companies that generate and hold such waste in France. In particular, the fast-food sector is subject to the regulation of all five streams. This requires the fast-food establishment to sort the waste according to its nature. To this end, establishments will have to equip their French sites with selective sorting stations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The GDPR sets out, among others, the following key principles and obligations that apply to the Group and its operations: - Lawfulness: any use/processing of personal data requires a specific legal basis. Use of personal data is permissible, for example: to the extent this is required to perform a contract; if the individual has given its consent; or if the organization has a legitimate interest. - Fairness and proportionality: processing of personal data must be fair, proportionate and compatible with the purpose for which the data were collected. - Transparency: individuals must be informed about the processing of their personal data. - Security: adequate technical and organizational measures need to be implemented to ensure the security of personal data. - Storage limitation: personal data may not be retained for longer than necessary and should be deleted after such period. - Data subject rights: individuals have several rights under the GDPR such as a: - right to access (obtain a copy of their personal data); 190 ----- - right to rectify any incorrect personal data; - right to request erasure of any personal data when no longer needed; - right to data portability (receive the personal data in a structured format so it can be used by another service provider); and - right to object to the use of personal data on in particular situations. - Use of third-party service providers: in the event the personal data is processed by a service provider (data processor) on behalf of a data controller, this processing needs to be governed by a contract between the data controller and the data processor. Such contract must include certain mandatory clauses, such as for example on the subject-matter and duration of the processing; the right to audit, not engaging other third-party providers without consent, etc. Personal data breaches: depending on the breach, the competent supervisory authority and/or the data subject may need to be informed of a personal data breach within 72 hours after becoming aware of such breach. - Record keeping: Controllers and processors are required to be able to demonstrate compliance with the rules imposed by the GDPR at all times and on an ongoing basis. To that end, organizations must maintain a record containing a description of all their data processing activities. - Data controllers and processors may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) in certain situations. - The transfer of personal data to entities outside the EEA is subject to specific requirements.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will: - accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid; - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on each February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, commencing on February 1, 2022; and - be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Note on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment date. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the SSN Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Senior Secured Notes. “Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the SSN Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the the SSN Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the SSN Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the SSN Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure specified in this paragraph is less than 0.0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0.0% for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate for such Interest Period. In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities hereunder, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the SSN Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the SSN Issuer, the SSN Issuer shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Notes; provided further that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0%. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this 221 ----- paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. “Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that have adopted the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude February 1, 2022. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. Brussels time on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each outstanding Senior Secured Note, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Notes is permitted by any applicable law.

The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. 229 ----- As described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the SSN Issuer that guarantees the New Revolving Credit Facility or other indebtedness of the SSN Issuer shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees or security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles which limit the ability of the SSN Issuer, a Guarantor or any SSN Holdco Security Provider to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security interest granted be limited by an amount or otherwise, as described below under “—Security—General”. Each of the Note Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be contractually limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or any security interest granted by such Guarantor, as applicable, could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes. Other debt of such Guarantor may not be similarly limited. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the _Collateral—Applicable laws may limit amounts recoverable under the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral”._ The operations of the SSN Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the SSN Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the SSN Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the SSN Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the SSN Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the SSN Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary.

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or other restrictions applicable to security providers, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers. The Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees will also secure the obligations of the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations on a _pari passu basis. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the obligations of the SSN Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations will be entitled to receive payment from the proceeds of enforcement of the Security Documents prior to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, under the SSN Indenture, the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to Incur certain additional Debt in the future that may share in the Collateral, including Debt with priority rights to proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. The amount of such additional Debt will be limited by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”. Under certain circumstances, the_ amount of such additional Debt that may share in the Collateral could be significant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including: - if the cost of providing security or perfecting the same is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders of Senior Secured Notes and the other secured parties; - if providing such security requires consent of a third party and such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors; - if providing such security would be prohibited or to the extent it would be limited by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles or if entering into the Security Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors or officers, contravene any legal prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors or officers; and - until an enforcement action is taken, if perfecting such security would have an unreasonable adverse effect on the ability of the SSN Issuer or the relevant Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as permitted by the SSN Indenture. Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors and the SSN Holdco Security Providers to secure the payment when due of the SSN Issuer’s and the Guarantors’, as applicable, payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, _inter alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the lenders under the New Revolving 233 ----- Credit Facility Agreement, certain secured hedge counterparties, and for the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes. Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests in France, the relevant Security Documents will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Debt under the Senior Secured Notes, the Note Guarantees and the other secured obligations). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in France. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral”. Each holder of Senior Secured Notes, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable, the Security Documents, and the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Senior Secured Notes, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such. The holders of the Senior Secured Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent (as creditor of the parallel debt, in respect of the Security Documents governed by French law), as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents (the “Security Interests”) that is in accordance with the SSN Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents in accordance with the SSN Indenture and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement of Transaction Security”._ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the SSN Issuer, the Guarantors and the SSN Holdco Security Providers, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing). The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the SSN Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees, respectively, and the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the SSN Indenture. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the _SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”._ No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the SSN Issuer or the Guarantors in connection with this Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the SSN Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes or the Note Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all. 234 ----- The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France.

Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the SSN Indenture. Unless the SSN Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the SSN Indenture and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the SSN Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of the Senior Secured Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Senior Secured Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the notice will state: (a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the Senior Secured Notes on the date specified in the notice; (b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute a Change of Control; (c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations; (d) that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; (e) that any Senior Secured Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and (f) any other procedures that a holder of Senior Secured Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. An agent of the SSN Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the SSN Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Senior Secured Notes properly 239 ----- tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for such Senior Secured Notes. The Trustee (or the authenticating agent appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Senior Secured Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated Senior Secured Notes; provided that each new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The SSN Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. The ability of the SSN Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the SSN Indenture. The SSN Issuer’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the SSN Issuer of such repurchase. If a Change of Control Offer is made, the SSN Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Senior Secured Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Senior Secured Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. If the SSN Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes the rights described under “—Events of _Default”._ Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the SSN Issuer and its subsidiaries may prohibit the prepayment of the Senior Secured Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. The New Revolving Credit Facility includes a covenant restricting the SSN Issuer from offering to purchase the Senior Secured Notes, unless the SSN Issuer has complied with its mandatory prepayment obligations in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility as a result of such Change of Control. If the SSN Issuer was so prohibited from conducting a Change of Control Offer and not able to prepay any indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the SSN Issuer would be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations to holders of the Senior Secured Notes who exercise their right to have their Senior Secured Notes repurchased following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default or Event of Default under the SSN Indenture. A Default or Event of Default under the SSN Indenture, unless waived by holders of the Senior Secured Notes, could result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements”._ The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the SSN Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the SSN Issuer and the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes. The SSN Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the SSN Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to limitations discussed below, the SSN Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the SSN Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the SSN Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the SSN Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Debt are contained in the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Limitation _on Liens”. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal_ amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “— _Amendments and Waivers”). Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the_ 240 ----- provisions of the SSN Indenture will not require the SSN Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the Senior Secured Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. The SSN Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the SSN Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the SSN Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the SSN Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the SSN Indenture are applicable. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the SSN Indenture, including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The SSN Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the SSN Indenture, the SSN Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the SSN Indenture by virtue of such conflict. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes of any series validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the SSN Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the SSN Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the SSN Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above), to redeem all Senior Secured Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of the date of redemption. “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) the SSN Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any “person” or “group” of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders, being or becoming the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the SSN Issuer (or any successor entity permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Certain _Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”); provided that, for the_ purposes of this clause, no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of the SSN Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent; 241 ----- (b) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person, other than or one or more Permitted Holders; or (c) the SSN Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or dissolution other than in a transaction that complies with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.” The provisions under the SSN Indenture relating to the SSN Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes if made prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control. For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the SSN Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Holders of the PIK Notes do not have a direct claim on the cashflow or assets of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries and the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries do not have any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the PIK Notes or to make funds available to the PIK Issuer for those purposes. Certain legal and contractual restrictions limit the PIK Issuer’s ability to access the cashflow of its Subsidiaries, including legal restrictions on the payment of corporate dividends as well as restrictions on the payment of corporate dividends under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the PIK Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries. Any right of the PIK Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon that Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the PIK Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the PIK Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the PIK Issuer would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary that is senior to that owing to the PIK Issuer. None of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries will provide a guarantee of the PIK Notes. At August 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” the PIK Issuer would have had total debt of €235.0 million. At August 31, 2021, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have had €1,135.4 million of indebtedness outstanding, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the PIK Notes, and €80.0 million of undrawn availability under the New Revolving Credit Facility. As of the Issue Date, all of the PIK Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the PIK Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the PIK Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the PIK Issuer will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the PIK Indenture and will not guarantee the PIK Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

To secure payment of such Cash Interest on each applicable interest payment date and the PIK Issuer’s other payment obligations under the PIK Notes, the PIK Issuer will grant security over the Cash Interest Account pursuant to an account pledge (the “Account Pledge”). The PIK Issuer shall be entitled, pursuant to the terms of the Account Pledge, at any time and from time to time, to require the release of all or any part of the funds deposited in the Cash Interest Account (including accrued interest on such amounts) in order to make certain payments, including payment of Cash Interest, on or in connection with the PIK Notes.

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the PIK Issuer and Topco GB to secure the payment when due of the PIK Issuer’s payment obligations under the PIK Notes and the PIK Indenture. The Security Documents with respect to the Collateral will be entered into by, inter alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the Trustee and the holders of PIK Notes. Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests in France, the relevant Security Documents will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Debt under the PIK Notes and the other secured obligations). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in France. See “Certain Insolvency Law 329 ----- _Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests—France— Parallel Debt—Trust”._ Each holder of PIK Notes, by accepting a PIK Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Security Agent (and, if applicable, the Trustee) to enter into the Security Documents and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of PIK Notes, by accepting a PIK Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such. The holders of the PIK Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent (as creditor of the parallel debt, in respect of the Security Documents governed by French law), as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents (the “Security Interests”) that is in accordance with the PIK Indenture without requiring any consent of the holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents in accordance with the PIK Indenture.

The value of the Collateral securing the PIK Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the PIK Issuer’s obligations under the PIK Notes, and the Collateral securing the PIK Notes may be reduced or diluted in the event of the issuance of Additional PIK Notes (as described under “—Additional PIK _Notes”, “—Terms of PIK Notes” or “—Additional Amounts”) and the disposition of assets comprising the_ Collateral, subject to the terms of the PIK Indenture. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes, the SSN Guarantees and the Collateral—The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes”._ No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the PIK Issuer in connection with this Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the PIK Indenture and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the PIK Notes. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all. The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France and provide that the rights with respect to the PIK Notes and the PIK Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and, in each case, in respect of the entire outstanding amount of the PIK Notes. The term “Security Interests” refers to the Liens on the Collateral. The PIK Issuer shall, and shall procure that the PIK Holdco Security Providers shall, at their own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent or the Trustee, as applicable, may require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the PIK Indenture and the relevant Security Document, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the Collateral.

If the redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the PIK Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose PIK Notes will be subject to redemption by the PIK Issuer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The PIK Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the PIK Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of such series of the PIK Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the PIK Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the PIK Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that the PIK Issuer is required to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. In addition, before the PIK Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the PIK Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and that it is entitled to redeem such PIK Notes pursuant to their terms.

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,920,DESCRIPTION OF THE PIK NOTES,920.16,Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control,920.16.1,,"If a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs at any time, then the PIK Issuer must make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of PIK Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof) of such holder’s PIK Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that are prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the PIK Indenture. Unless the PIK Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the PIK Notes in accordance with the PIK Indenture, all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the PIK Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of the PIK Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase PIK Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the notice will state: (a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the PIK Notes on the date specified in the notice; (b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute a Change of Control; (c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations; (d) that any PIK Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; (e) that any PIK Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and (f) any other procedures that a holder of PIK Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. An agent of the PIK Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the PIK Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of PIK Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for such PIK Notes. The Trustee (or the authenticating agent appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new PIK Note or PIK Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of PIK Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of PIK Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated PIK Notes; provided that each new PIK Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof. The PIK Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. 335 ----- The ability of the PIK Issuer to repurchase PIK Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the PIK Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the terms of the PIK Issuer’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require the Senior Secured Notes or such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the PIK Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the PIK Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the PIK Issuer of such repurchase. If a Change of Control Offer is made, the PIK Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the PIK Notes that might be delivered by holders of the PIK Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. The terms of the existing indebtedness of the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries (including the Senior Secured Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and future indebtedness of such subsidiaries may prevent such subsidiaries from paying dividends or making other payments or distributions to the PIK Issuer to enable it to pay such Change of Control Purchase Price. If the PIK Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the PIK Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default”. Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the other indebtedness of the PIK Issuer and its subsidiaries may prohibit the prepayment of the PIK Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the PIK Issuer was so prohibited from conducting a Change of Control Offer and not able to prepay any indebtedness containing any such restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the PIK Issuer would be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations to holders of the PIK Notes who exercise their right to have their PIK Notes repurchased following a Change of Control, which would cause a Default or Event of Default under the PIK Indenture. A Default or Event of Default under the PIK Indenture, unless waived by holders of the PIK Notes, could result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. The Change of Control purchase feature of the PIK Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the PIK Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the PIK Issuer and the initial purchasers of the PIK Notes. The PIK Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the PIK Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to limitations discussed below, the PIK Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the PIK Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the PIK Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the PIK Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Debt are contained in the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Limitation on Liens”. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the PIK Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers”). Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the provisions of the PIK Indenture will not require the PIK Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the PIK Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. The PIK Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the PIK Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the PIK Issuer and purchases all PIK Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the PIK Indenture as described above 336 ----- under the caption “—Optional Redemption” or “—Special Mandatory Redemption—IPO Event”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the PIK Indenture are applicable. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the PIK Indenture, including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The PIK Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the PIK Indenture, the PIK Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the PIK Indenture by virtue of such conflict. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding PIK Notes of any series validly tender and do not withdraw such PIK Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the PIK Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the PIK Issuer as described above, purchases all of the PIK Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the PIK Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above), to redeem all PIK Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the Change of Control Purchase Price plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Purchase Price, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of the date of redemption. “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) the PIK Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any “person” or “group” of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders, being or becoming the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the PIK Issuer (or any successor entity permitted by the covenant described under the caption “—Certain _Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”); provided that, for the_ purposes of this clause, no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of the PIK Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent; (b) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the PIK Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person, other than or one or more Permitted Holders; or (c) the PIK Issuer is liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or dissolution other than in a transaction that complies with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.” 337 ----- The provisions under the PIK Indenture relating to the PIK Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the PIK Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the PIK Notes if made prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control. For so long as the PIK Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the PIK Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of PIK Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the PIK Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the PIK Indenture. If any PIK Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that PIK Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that PIK Note that is to be redeemed. While the PIK Notes are held in certificated form, a new PIK Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original PIK Note will be issued in the name of the holder of PIK Notes upon cancellation of the original PIK Note. PIK Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on PIK Notes or portions of PIK Notes redeemed. For PIK Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any PIK Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant PIK Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption, the PIK Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of PIK Notes outstanding. 338 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

(7) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (2)(a) through (s) of this covenant or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the PIK Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary will, in its sole discretion, be permitted to classify items of Debt on the date of its Incurrence and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Debt in one of such clauses or paragraphs, and the PIK Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant, and may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type of Debt described in this “— _Limitation on Debt” covenant at any time; provided that all Debt Incurred under the New_ Revolving Credit Facility will be deemed to have been Incurred in reliance on the exception provided in clause (2)(a) above and may not be reclassified.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the applicable Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction. In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and _Exchange” and “Description of the PIK Notes—Transfer and Exchange”, and, if required, only if the_ transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the applicable Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuers nor any of the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee or any of the Agents is responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. 413 ----- Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) who purchases the Notes for cash at their issue price (generally, with respect to any series of Notes, the first price at which a substantial amount of such series of Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) and who holds the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdictions outside the United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Relating to the Senior Secured Notes",62.2.2,Stated Interest,"Payments of stated interest on a Senior Secured Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Senior Secured Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize 416 ----- foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment.

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Relating to the Senior Secured Notes",62.2.3,"Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Senior Secured Notes","Generally, upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note, a U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange,, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Senior Secured Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Senior Secured Note generally will equal the cost of the Senior Secured Note to the U.S. holder, increased by any OID included in the U.S. holder's income with respect to such Senior Secured Note. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Senior Secured Note, the cost of the Senior Secured Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Senior Secured Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Senior Secured Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Senior Secured Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Senior Secured Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Senior Secured Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Stated Interest”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note. 417 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.3,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Relating to the PIK Notes,62.3.2,Original Issue Discount on the PIK Notes,"The PIK Notes will be treated as being issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes because their “stated redemption price at maturity” will exceed their “issue price” by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount. The stated redemption price at maturity of a PIK Note will be equal to the sum of all payments due on the PIK Note other than “qualified stated interest” (generally, stated interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer)). The issue price of a PIK Note will be equal to the first price at which a substantial amount of such series of PIK Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. None of the stated interest on the PIK Notes will constitute qualified stated interest because, under certain circumstances, the PIK Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to pay interest by issuing additional PIK Notes rather than by paying cash. As such, U.S. holders will generally be required to include the stated interest on the PIK Notes as OID. There will be additional OID if and to the extent that the issue price of the PIK Notes is less than their stated principal amount. A U.S. holder is required to include any OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of tax accounting. The amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder of a PIK Note will be the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the PIK Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such PIK Note (“accrued OID”). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a PIK Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the PIK Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the product of the PIK Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly 418 ----- adjusted for the length of such period). OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules apply for calculating OID for a short initial accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a PIK Note at the start of any accrual period is generally equal to its issue price (as defined above), increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by the amount of any payment on the PIK Note (other than payments of interest made by issuing additional PIK Notes as described below). The yield to maturity of a PIK Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all payments to be made under the PIK Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the PIK Note. For purposes of calculating the yield to maturity of the PIK Notes, the PIK Issuer intends to take the position, to the extent it is required to do so, that the yield to maturity is computed using a payment schedule in which interest on the PIK Notes is initially assumed to be paid in cash. If, contrary to this assumption, the PIK Issuer pays interest in any period by issuing additional PIK Notes rather than by paying cash, then, solely for the purposes of determining the amount of OID on the PIK Notes, the PIK Notes will be treated as retired and reissued on the date of such payment for an amount equal to their adjusted issue price, and the yield to maturity of the PIK Notes will be redetermined taking into account the change in circumstances. Such deemed reissued PIK Notes could be subject to the Treasury Regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments, which could result in adverse tax consequences to U.S. holders as discussed above under “—Characterization of the PIK Notes.” Any payments of interest made by issuing additional PIK Notes rather than by paying cash will not be treated as payments of interest on the PIK Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, any such additional PIK Notes will be treated together with the PIK Note on which such additional PIK Notes were paid as a single PIK Note for U.S. federal income tax purposes. OID on the PIK Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar value of accrued OID will be determined by translating such OID at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year. A U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate accrued OID using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder may translate the accrued OID using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to other debt obligations held by the U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the payment received (determined at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all cash receipts on the PIK Notes will be viewed, first, as receipts of previously accrued OID, with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and second, as the receipt of principal. Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S.- source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules regarding OID are complex. Accordingly, U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the OID rules, including the consequences to such holders of the Issuer’s decision to pay interest in cash or additional PIK Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a PIK Note will generally equal the cost of such PIK Note to such U.S. holder, increased by the amount of OID accrued on the PIK Note and reduced by the amount of any payments received on the PIK Notes (including payments of interest in cash, but excluding payments of interest made by issuing additional PIK Notes). Although the matter is not free from doubt, if the PIK Issuer pays interest by issuing additional PIK Notes rather than by paying cash, a U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its PIK Note should likely be allocated between its PIK Note and such additional PIK Notes in proportion to their relative principal amounts. A U.S. holder’s holding period in any such additional PIK Notes should also likely be identical to its holding period for the PIK Note with respect to which the additional PIK Notes were received. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a PIK Note, the cost of the PIK Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase. In the case of a PIK Note that is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder, and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such PIK Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders with respect to the purchase and sale of PIK Notes traded on an established securities market, which is discussed in the two preceding paragraphs, must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and will generally be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates generally will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price for the PIK Note, determined on the date such payment is received or such PIK Note is disposed of, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price for the PIK Note, determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired such PIK Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note, a U.S. holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received in respect of accrued and unpaid OID. Any such exchange gain or loss with respect to OID will be determined as discussed under “—Original Issue Discount on the PIK Notes”. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note, a U.S. holder will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued OID only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the disposition. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of exchange gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the PIK Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a PIK Note. 420 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of a restructuring. 428 ----- In order to transpose the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, the French government issued: (i) on September 15, 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as from October 1, 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and (ii) on September 23, 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the implementation of the 2021 Ordinance.

In_ practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are 431 ----- not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision appointing the _mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat _ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred_ from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually also accept to abstain from such action while they are ongoing. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_ difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. Pursuant to Article 1 of ordinance no. 2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020 adopted in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, until December 31, 2021, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of conciliation proceedings commenced as from August 24, 2020 may be extended, one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president of the court, up to a maximum of ten months. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above) if a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, is suing for payment, or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim (suspendre l’exigibilité de sa créance). In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge. Pursuant to the Main Covid Ordinance, until December 31, 2021, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim for the duration of the 432 ----- conciliation proceedings, the debtor may also request from the president of the Commercial Court in _ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:_ (i) the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment default; (ii) the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable property as well as of any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor; or (iii) the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor - following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened – if: (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (ii) the terms of the conciliation agreement ensure the continuation of the business as a going-concern; and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgment (constatation) as described above and, in addition: (i) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the amount of any Conciliation Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court; (ii) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including with respect to certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “Conciliation",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment_ is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors (or submit to the classes of affected parties – see below) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission _d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a_ creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de _disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions_ considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de _cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator,_ the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. 435 ----- In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (i)(b) above where: (i) the court may not act upon its own initiative, and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller (“Contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. _Restructuring Lien: Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard or judicial_ reorganization proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial Restructuring Lien”): (i) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the supervisory judge and are subject to publicity, or (ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan, enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien (iv) pre-commencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code. The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to commencement of the proceedings. In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a crossclass cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. Creditors (and if applicable, equity holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-forequity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. 436 ----- _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for_ commencement of the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt writeoffs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). Pursuant to the Main Covid Ordinance, until December 31, 2021, the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for agricultural businesses as follows: (i) this extension results from a decision of the court (a) upon request of the public prosecutor or of the commissioner appointed to supervise the implementation of the plan without having to comply with the process that applies to substantial modifications of the plan (modification substantielle du plan) or (b) taken through the process that applies to substantial modifications of the plan; and (ii) the initial payment instalments shall be adapted by the president of the court or the court to the duration of the plan so extended, without having to comply with the provisions of Article L. 626-18 of the French Commercial Code (including the obligation to pay an annual instalment of 5% minimum as from year 3) who may order certain grace periods pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code within the limit of the new term of the plan so extended. Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the courtappointed administrator and the controllers. Pursuant to the Main Covid Ordinance, until December 31, 2021, the abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors’ representative. 437 ----- Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to them (subject to exceptions such as the ones applicable to claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates falling after the term of the plan, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if such date is later than the first payment date provided for in the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps. _Class-based consultation: This applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for_ commencement of the proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 2333 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties affectées), as defined below. Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan. Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code, affected parties are: (i) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan; (ii) equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are modified by the proposed plan. The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes representing a sufficient commonality 438 ----- of economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions: (i) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests _in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of the portion of their claim so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes; (ii) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class; (iii) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and (iv) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme (AGS) claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account. The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered certified accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust. Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the courtappointed administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the parties. The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debtfor-equity swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien). The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree. The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the courtappointed administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days. The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting a vote. 439 ----- If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority. Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met: (i) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above; (ii) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated equally and in proportion to their claim or right; (iii) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties; (iv) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e., no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved); (v) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and (vi) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected. The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). Cross-class cram-down: The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a_ cross-class cram-down mechanism into French law: where the safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the parties that voted against the plan provided that: (i) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; (ii) the plan has been approved by: (a) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors’ class (créanciers chirographaires); or, if such condition is not met, 440 ----- (b) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment under the order of priority applicable to a judicial liquidation (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan _de cession));_ (iii) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e., absolute priority rule); (iv) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its claims or interests; (v) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if: (a) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and 20 million euros of net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover; (b) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest under the order of priority applicable to a judicial liquidation (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession)); (c) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, pro rata their shareholding; and (d) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of equity holders, The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes. Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption. As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent. If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the _mandataire judiciaire or the public 441 ----- prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent. At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that (i) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or (ii) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met: (a) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a payment in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation or, in the event of a sale of the debtor’s assets as part of a courtordered disposal plan, were applied; (b) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such class(es) would not have received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation or, in the event of a sale of the debtor’s assets as part of a court-ordered disposal plan, were applied, may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor. In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed and, in judicial reorganization proceedings, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see section “Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings” below)). _Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations,_ social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission _des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards_ indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. 442 ----- Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called upon to vote on the proposed plan.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: (i) its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux _comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable);_ (ii) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; (iii) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough parties that will be impaired by such plan to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period which may be extended up to four months upon request from the debtor and the court-appointed administrator; and (iv) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings. The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors alone. If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditors’ classes (see above) to be formed, the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected parties, party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered-accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing (see section “Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial _Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings” below)._ 443 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above). _De jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), the partial or total disposal of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission _d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor_ (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and the adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows: (i) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the courtappointed administrator on its own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); (ii) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; 444 ----- (iii) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void. (iv) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide to apply the cross-class cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in addition to the debtor or the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and (v) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cramdown) fails the approval of the plan may occur through the individual consultation rules (see above). In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization proceedings: (i) in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan; (ii) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (b) the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: (a) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or (b) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. 445 ----- In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered disposal plan (plan de cession). At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: (i) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “disposal plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern market value. The court will tend to favor a credible disposal plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a disposal plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: (a) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; (b) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and 446 ----- (c) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their going-concern market value; or (ii) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (a) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or _adjudication amiable_ for real estate assets only); (b) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (c) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure _des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is_ questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court orders a disposal plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either: (i) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif); or (ii) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: (i) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or (ii) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. 447 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Failing this, the date of insolvency is deemed to be the date of such court judgment. The court may in any case reconsider the same at a later stage and set an earlier date for the occurrence of insolvency, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of the court judgment commencing the proceedings. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of a professional receivables (Dailly assignement) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the sixmonth period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”.

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions _of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the_ French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, no. 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a disposal plan (plan de cession) as described above. In such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision ordering the disposal plan, as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge _commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor based_ on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine _fiduciaire) required by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier_ requesting payment directly from the debtor; (iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge; (iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the _mandataire _judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or_ the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; 449 ----- (v) creditors (or beneficiaries of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (a) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (b) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed to the creditor; or (c) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution _judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or_ intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings which may be commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); and (vi) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code and (vii) in the context of reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan or of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court. In accelerated safeguard, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des 450 ----- _Annonces Civiles et Commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled_ outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two-month or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors’ representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or chartered certified accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court orders a disposal plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a Conciliation Lien or a Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and public creditors (i.e., taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority is not relevant to all creditors, for example creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset will be treated separately.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Any payment made by such SSN Guarantor under its SSN Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such SSN Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a SSN Guarantor’s obligation under the SSN Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a SSN Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its SSN Guarantee. The amount secured by any SSN Collateral which is granted by any such SSN Guarantor (or any other guarantor which is incorporated in France) will likewise be limited by the amount which it is so able to guarantee. In addition, if a SSN Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such SSN Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent may have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent.

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities and related cash proceeds and incomes (fruits et produits). Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or court appointed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities and related cash proceeds and incomes (fruits et produits) as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities and related cash proceeds and incomes (fruits et produits) is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities and related cash proceeds and incomes (fruits et _produits), and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect._ An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (i.e., prepack disposal plan) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements, 434 ----- offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may, after consultation of the public prosecutor, be considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of_ the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. Although French accelerated safeguard proceedings are the transposition into French law of preventive restructuring proceedings in the spirit of the EU Restructuring Directive, they are defined in the French Commercial Code by reference to standard safeguard proceedings. As a result and for the sake of clarity, standard safeguard proceedings will be presented below before accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres _financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account_ in which the shares of such a company are registered. Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking pledge thereon. To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower) ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset, this article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial 454 ----- securities account, and consequently, no assurances can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Note Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event. French _Ordonnance n°2021-1192 dated 15 September 2021 provides however that the relevant provisions of_ French law will be amended from 1[st] January 2022 to expressely recognize the possibility to grant successive pledges over the same securities account.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so,; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). 455 ----- If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a SSN Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such SSN Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the SSN Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the SSN Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on parallel debt mechanisms (Cass. com., September 13, 2011, no. 10-25533, “Belvédère”) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting 453 ----- from a parallel debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a parallel debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy _(ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not_ exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the parallel debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of parallel debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a parallel debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt claim. There is no certainty that the parallel debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as parallel debt creditor under the parallel debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes may not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are qualified broker-dealers under applicable law. We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuers will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuers have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions”. Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: - a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; - a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or - not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Listing Prospectus nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Listing Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Listing Prospectus comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Listing Prospectus and resale of the Notes. See “Important Information About This Listing Prospectus” and “Notice to _Investors”._ The Notes and the SSN Guarantees are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuers have applied to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof; however, the Issuers cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuers cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. 458 ----- We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the Issue Date, which will be seven business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is referred to as “T + 7”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of the Offering Memorandum or the next four succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their respective behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Managers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided, and may in the future provide, commercial lending, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuers, the SSN Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees and expenses. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers or the Issuers’ affiliates. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers will be mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will be made available to the SSN Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries on or about the Issue Date. Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker-dealers registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by FINRA regulations. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer, whether or not participating in the Offering, may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act and in connection with any applicable state securities laws. 459 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. Actions in the United States under the U.S. federal securities laws could be affected under certain circumstances by (i) the French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by the French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) and by (ii) the French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 (relating to the protection of business confidentiality) which may both preclude or restrict the obtaining of evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789
44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.2,France,23.2.1,,"The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal judiciare) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. The civil court with territorial jurisdiction is determined in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the French Code of Civil Procedure. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained, at the request of the party in whose favor the judgment was rendered, following proper proceedings (i.e., non ex parte) if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only a U.S. judgment that is enforceable in the jurisdiction of the U.S. court which rendered it can benefit from an exequatur under French law, 467 ----- that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the _res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France after all remedies have been exhausted. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal, the appeal Court decision also being rendered on the ground of the above-mentioned criteria. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be affected under certain circumstances by (i) French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) and by (ii) the French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 (relating to the protection of business confidentiality) which may both prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (Law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified by the French law No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 (relating to the protection of personal data)) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules. Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) (the “Brussels I Regulation (Recast)”), the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in a Member State where the legal actions fall within the scope of Brussels I Regulation (Recast). Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Brussels I Regulation (Recast), the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the 468 ----- EU. Moreover, three decisions of the civil chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) dated September 26, 2012, March 25, 2015 and October 7, 2015 and a decision of the commercial chamber of the French Supreme Court permit that contractual provisions submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party an additional option to choose another jurisdiction (one-sided jurisdiction clauses) may only be effective if they set out an objective basis for the alternative jurisdictions that one party could choose. Accordingly, any one-sided jurisdiction clauses which do not set out an objective basis (as a reference to a ground of jurisdiction or to legal rules) in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) confirmed in 2018 its earlier decisions rendered in 2015 and 2012. However, these decisions were made on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters or on the basis of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters signed in Lugano on October 30, 2007 and that such decisions have yet to be confirmed in the context of Brussels I Regulation (Recast). 469 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF THE PERIOD AND POST-BALANCE ###### SHEET EVENTS 2.1. Significant events of the period The first half of 2021 was marked by the following significant events: Covid-19 health crisis The health crisis arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, which began to significantly impact the Burger King France Group's business in March 2020, continued throughout the first half of 2021. Burger King Group France had to deal with various restrictive measures, such as a ban on indoor sales until May 19, 2021, the closure of major shopping centers, and national curfews for part of the first half of the year. Business was also affected by traffic restrictions that prevented customers from going to our restaurants, the closure of children's play areas, the lack of foreign tourists and the temporary closure of some restaurants in airports and train stations. Despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on its restaurants, the Group has ensured that it has sufficient liquidity to cover its short and medium-term obligations, for itself and for each of its subsidiaries. The ability of the Group and its subsidiaries to continue as going concerns is therefore not at risk. It should be noted that on March 14, 2020 the French government ordered the closure of restaurants until at least April 15, 2020. Furthermore, on March 16, 2020 the government announced lockdown measures that required everyone residing in France to remain at home until at least March 31, 2020, except for reasons of absolute necessity. This lockdown period was subsequently extended. Given the uncertainty of the health crisis, when the restaurant closures were announced in March 2020, the Group immediately decided to draw down all of its available credit lines, and most significantly the €60 million RCF line (see Note 10.2). The Group also immediately worked with its creditors to obtain a government-guaranteed ""PGE"" loan for €80 million at the end of the first half of the year (see Note 10.2). After securing this loan, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million on the RCF line and thus reduce its use to €20 million (see Note 10.2). Business development ----- ###### After opening 21 restaurants in 2020 (including 20 under the Burger King® brand) and converting 9 restaurants previously operated under the Quick® brand to the Burger King® brand, the Group continued to expand in the first half of 2021 with: • The opening of 17 new restaurants, including 15 operated under the Burger King® brand • The conversion to the Burger King® brand of 15 restaurants formerly operating under the Quick® brand. A significant portion of the investments for this development was assumed by the lessors or supported by the Group's franchisees, thus limiting the Group's remaining net investment. System-wide sales At June 30, 2021, the Group's system-wide sales for the first half totaled €618 million, of which continuing operations accounted for €517 million (an increase of €168 million year-on-year) and discontinued operations for €101 million (an increase of €26 million year-on-year). The increase in the Group's system-wide sales is mainly attributable to: • The Covid-19 health crisis's constraints on restaurant business in the first half of 2020, which resulted in the temporary closure of all restaurants between March 16 and the end of April 2020, and then the gradual reopening of restaurants, subject to restrictive measures, between the end of April and June 30, 2020 • The resumption of near-normal business activity on May 19, 2021, as the remaining Covid-19 measures were eased during the first months of 2021 • The opening of 28 new Burger King® restaurants over the 12 months up to June 30, 2021 (of which 15 in H1 2021 and 13 in H2 2020), and • The development or expansion of new sales channels (home delivery, click & collect and pick-up parking). However, this increase was partially offset by: • The banning of in-restaurant sales until May 19, 2021 • The extension of the closure of shopping centers from larger than 20,000m² to larger than 10,000m², which required the closure of restaurants in these shopping centers that did not have drive-through access • Nation-wide curfews • Other restrictive measures, such as a 50% limit on indoor dining as of May 19, 2021, and the closure of our children's areas • The lack of tourists • Temporary closure of some restaurants in airports and railway stations • The permanent closure or sale of five Quick® restaurants. 2.2. Post-balance sheet events On July 30, 2021, Burger King France announced that it had signed an agreement with H.I.G. Capital private- equity funds to sell 107 Quick® restaurants, through the sale of 100% of the share capital of its subsidiary Quick Restaurants S.A. This disposal will strengthen the Group's financial structure and enable it to pursue its development. The approximately €240 million obtained from this disposal will be used to repay all of the €80 million ""PGE"" government-guaranteed loan granted in June 2020, and to reduce the Group's total net debt. ----- ###### This disposal is expected to close before the end of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of the usual requirements for such a transaction, such as antitrust clearance. ----- ##### 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION ###### 3.1. Declaration of conformity The interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting"" and should be read in conjunction with the Group's latest annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the ""latest annual financial statements""). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared under IFRS. However, they include selected notes explaining significant events and transactions that serve to understand changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the most recent annual financial statements. All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-andsupplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adoptinginternational-accounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric ###### These interim financial statements were prepared under the Chair's responsibility as of July 30, 2021. 3.2. Changes in the accounting framework Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2021 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2021 are: • Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 • Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Reform of benchmark interest rates (Phase 2). These new standards had no material impact on the Group's interim consolidated financial statements. The extension of the IFRS 16 amendment approved by the EU on August 31, 2021 was not taken into account in the June 30, accounts and the Group does not expect this to have a material impact on the December 31, 2021 accounts. Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2022 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2022: • Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts: Contract performance costs • Amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 9, Illustrative Examples of IFRS 16 and IAS 41 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2018 - 2020; • Amendments to IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment: Revenue earned before the intended use ----- ###### • Amendments to IFRS 3 – References to the Conceptual Framework At the time of this publication, the Group does not expect these new standards to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 3.3. Use of estimates and judgments In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements. Management's significant judgments in applying the Group's accounting policies and the main sources of estimation uncertainty are those described in the most recent annual financial statements. 3.4. Methods used to translate foreign currency transactions The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the operating currency of all Group entities. All amounts are rounded to the nearest one thousand euros, unless otherwise indicated. Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement. 3.5. Basis of assessment The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivatives which are measured at fair value. ----- ##### 4. CONSOLIDATION SCOPE ###### 4.1.

Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities held for sale In order to focus on the development of the Burger King brand in France, since 2019 the Group has been reorganizing Quick's business activities into a separate group of companies to facilitate their sale. During the first year, the restrictive measures imposed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus prevented the formal launching of the process to sell Quick business activities. However, throughout this period, the Group took the necessary steps to prepare for this sale, which included setting up a dedicated management structure and proceeding with the legal reorganization of the businesses to be sold. Given this reorganization and the steps already taken, the Group considered that the sale of this business was highly probable within the next twelve months and met the IFRS 5 classification criteria at the end of 2019 and of 2020. As explained in the subsequent events section (see Note 2.2), efforts to sell the Quick Group were pursued in July 2021 and resulted in a purchase offer on July 29, 2021. Given the final administrative formalities to be completed, the disposal of the business is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021, for a price of approximately €240 million, which exceeds the net asset value of the business to be sold (€238.7 million). 4.2.1. **ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE ###### The group of companies to be sold consists of the following assets and liabilities at June 30, 2020 In 000 EUR_ June 2021 Dec. 2020 Goodwill 47 584 47 584 Intangible assets 113 045 113 053 Property, plant and equipment 137 997 124 289 Inventories 64 91 Trade and other receivables 14 029 12 058 Cash and cash equivalents 17 491 2 031 Assets held for sale 330 210 299 106 Lease liabilities 64 029 59 903 Trade and other payables 27 484 13 414 Liabilities held for sale 91 513 73 317 ###### The above assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value. The increase in property, plant and equipment is attributable to the increase in rights of use resulting from the renewal of some leases in 2021. ----- ###### The changes in trade and other payables are mainly due to the unwinding of inter-company relationships between the entities to be sold and those that comprise the continuing operations.

This increase is mostly attributable to the Covid crisis and the factors that are responsible for the increase in system-wide sales. System-wide sales are the sales to consumers of the Group-owned restaurants and the restaurants operated by our Burger King and Quick franchise partners. In addition to the above factors, eight restaurants that were previously operated directly by the Group were franchised over the past 12 months. The impact of this was partially offset by the Group's taking over of two restaurants previously operated under a franchise. ----- 6.1.2. **ROYALTIES AND OTHER CHARGES TO FRANCHISEES ###### At June 30, 2021, there were 337 franchised restaurants, compared to 291 a year earlier.

This increase over the previous year is mainly attributable to the increase in retail sales, as explained above. In addition to the above: • The transfer to franchisees of eight restaurants the Group operated directly was partially offset by the Group's takeover of two franchised restaurants. • The support provided to our franchisees during the Covid-19 crisis in the first half of 2020 – which involved temporary adjustments to royalty payments under formal contract amendments, the suspension of guaranteed minimum royalties during lockdown periods, and variable royalty schedules to facilitate the resumption of normal business activity – had a much greater impact on sales than the support provided in the first half of 2021. • The permanent closure or sale of five Quick® restaurants.

This change is partially offset by the increase in trade receivables resulting from the recovery of business. The deterioration of the positive impact of the change in trade payables and other current liabilities, from €7.8 million at the end of June 2020 to €1.5 million at the end of June 2021, is mainly attributable to the suspension of the payment of some Q2 2020 rents at the end of June 2020 under agreements negotiated with our main lessors during the Covid-19 crisis.

These tests resulted in no any additional impairment losses. The recoverable amount of these CGUs was assessed on the basis of their value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions, which are identical to those used for the assessment at December 31, 2020:",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

The Group has individually re-tested the CGUs by changing the key valuation assumptions as follows: • Increasing the discount rate by 0.50 percentage points, from 7.00% to 7.50% • Decreasing the perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value, from 2% to 1.50% • Decreasing the sales growth rate over the 5-year business plan from 1.50% to 0.50% These changes had no material impact on the impairment of restaurant CGUs. 8.4.2. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE ###### The impairment testing at June 30, 2021 did not require a review of the impairment recognized at December 31, 2020. The recoverable amount of the Group as a whole was therefore not assessed at June 30, 2021. The excess recoverable amount recognized at December 31, 2020 (approximately €593 million) was sufficient.

Bank loans In June 2020, the Group obtained a government-guaranteed ""PGE"" loan to meet its cash requirements during the Covid-19 crisis. Of this €80 million loan, €60 million was allocated to France BKR and €20 million to Burger King France. The loan was arranged with a pool of three banks and is backed by a 90% government guarantee.  Although no interest was paid in 2020, a guarantee fee of 0.5% was. In June 2021, the repayment of the government-backed PGE loan was deferred by one year and its maturity was extended for a further year. It will therefore fall due on June 18, 2023.  On June 18, 2021, the guarantee fee was increased from 0.5% to 1.0% and the pool banks will charge interest on their advances at an average rate of Euribor + 0.24% (0% floor). Although this loan is due on June 30, 2023, it is classified as a current liability since it may immediately fall due if significant assets are disposed of. Since the planned disposal of the Quick business (see Post-balance sheet events and Note 4.2) would meet this criterion, this loan has been classified as a current liability to ensure consistent accounting treatment. ----- ###### Bond issues The table below shows the key characteristics of the Group's bond issues:",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

This tranche was issued in two phases: initially on April 21, 2017 for €250 million, with proceeds of 99.5% and the balance recognized as an issuance discount, and subsequently on 19 December 2017 for €60 million, with proceeds of 101.75% and the balance recognized as an issuance premium. Burger King France may prepay all or part of these bonds. The €16.9 million in bond issuance costs are spread over the term of the bond. They were €7.4 million at June 30, 2021, vs. €8.8 million at December 31, 2020. This change is explained by the spreading out of bond issuance costs in 2021.

The interest rate from 1 January to June 30, 2021 is Euribor +3.0% (with a 0% floor). As soon as the announcement was made that restaurants would close in March 2020, the Group decided to draw down all of its €60 million RCF line. At the end of June 2020, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million of the RCF line, thus reducing the used portion to €20 million. At June 30, 2021, €20 million of this line of credit had been used. If over 35% of the RCF is used, the Group's quarterly leverage ratio (EBITDA / net debt) must not exceed 7.5.

The exercise price of this option was calculated using a contractually predetermined formula. The option may be exercised in 2027. Since the non-controlling interests are still entitled to their share of Agaquick's earnings, the Group has opted for a ""mixed"" accounting treatment of this commitment. 1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement. The Group also has an option to purchase all of the shares that Picpain holds in Agaquick, which it may exercise pursuant to the shareholders' agreement in 2039, or in the event of a change in the ownership structure of Picpain's Agaquick shares, or in the event of a legal dispute for which Picpain is held liable. 10.3.

Note 2: As allowed under IFRS, the fair value of the lease liability and its level in the fair-value hierarchy is not provided. The fair value of other financial instruments was determined as follows: • High-yield bonds and floating-rate loans: their fair value is considered to be near their carrying amount, as the impact of a change in the Group's credit spread is considered immaterial • Other fixed-rate financial debts and minority buy-out commitment debts: the fair value of debt is determined for each loan by discounting future cash flows at the closing market rate. • Standard valuation models were used to estimate the fair value of derivatives. ----- ###### 10.4. Risk management 10.4.1. **GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY ###### The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate risk. The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its floating-rate debt. Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies. The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health. 10.4.2. **INTEREST RATE RISK ###### As of May 2021, the Group stopped using caps to hedge its floating-rate bonds. In 2020, the Group used caps to hedge its floating-rate bond debt. These derivatives are qualified as cash flow hedging instruments.

There were no currency hedging commitments at June 30, 2021 or at December 31, 2020. Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk the latter had no material impact on income (as in 2020). |At June 30, 2021 0.5% decrease in interest rates Impact on Impact on equity income In 000 EUR|0.5% increase in interest rates| |---|---| ||Impact on Impact on equity income| |Investments - (400)|- 400| |TOTAL IMPACT - (400)|- 400| |At December 31, 2020 0.5% decrease in interest rates Impact on Impact on equity income In 000 EUR|0.5% increase in interest rates| |---|---| ||Impact on Impact on equity income| |Investments - (400)|- 400| |TOTAL IMPACT - (400)|- 400| ----- 10.4.4. **CREDIT RISK ###### Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group. Deposits and guarantees The credit risk on deposits and guarantees is considered to be limited. Cash and cash equivalents With regard to cash and cash equivalents, the credit risk is considered to be limited insofar as: • they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day-to-day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles. • they are invested exclusively in money market instruments. Trade receivables Trade receivables are the amounts owed by franchisees. They may be impaired on the basis of expected credit losses. Indicators of expected losses include, for example, significant financial difficulties of a franchisee or a breach of the franchise agreement (e.g. payment is past due more than x days). These receivables deemed to be at risk are fully impaired if there are indicators of expected credit loss. At June 30, 2021, this impairment totaled €5.5 million, vs. €6.9 million at December 31, 2020. In 2020, the risk of non-recovery was assessed for €2.7 million of the business lease fees for March 2020, the payment dates for which were deferred throughout 2021. In the first half of 2021, franchisees were charged 1/12th of their March 2020 fee each month, with no defaults observed. The provision for this was accordingly decreased to €1.3 million at June 30, 2021. A statistics-based provision is made for receivables that are not impaired on the basis of expected credit losses. This statistical provision is based on the history of credit losses actually incurred over the past ten years. At June 30, 2021, this provision was €64 thousand, vs. €64 thousand at December 31, 2020. Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables. 10.4.5. **LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE ###### The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity. The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short- term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities. Current debt includes the €80 million government-guaranteed ""PGE"" loan (see Note 10.2). However, the Group plans to repay it when the Quick business is disposed of (see Note 4.2). The Group therefore believes ----- ###### that it has sufficient resources to cover the €211 million in current liabilities, which include the 80 million PGE loan that will immediately fall due if the Quick business is sold. ----- ###### The table below shows the maturity profile of financial liabilities at June 30, 2021: Contractual cash flows Total nonBook discounted < 1 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 5 to 6 6 to 7 Over In 000 EUR_ value contractual yr yr yr yr yr yr yr 7 yr cash flows Non-derivative financial liabilities Bond issues 630 773 714 612 35 311 345 401 333 900  -  -  -  -  Bank loans and overdraft facilities 128 974 131 422 113 945 12 991 2 022 1 213 847 404  -  Other financial liabilities 2 630 2 707 1 527 1 180  -  -  -  -  -  Lease liability 475 476 787 284 77 982 73 916 72 131 70 086 65 549  61 257  56 038 310 325 _o/w the liability on the scope to be sold_ _89 267_ _12 273_ _9 929_ _8 635_ _7 682_ _6 879_ _6 354_ _6 109 31 408_ Minority interest purchase commitment liability 26 113 26 113  -  -  -  -  -  - 26 113  Total 1 263 966 1 662 137 228 765 433 488 408 053 71 299    66 396 61 661 82 151 310 325 Derivative liabilities Interest rate swaps used for hedging  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Total - - - - - - - - - ###### The table below shows the maturity profile of financial liabilities at December 31, 2020: Contractual cash flows Total nonBook discounted < 1 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 5 to 6 6 to 7 Over In 000 EUR_ value contractual yr yr yr yr yr yr yr 7 yr cash flows Non-derivative financial liabilities Bond issues 630 863 726 502 35 401 35 401 334 400 321 300  -  -  -  Bank loans and overdraft facilities 130 380 131 394 98 706 27 047 2 220 1 672 923 732 94  Other financial liabilities 2 903 2 894 1 190 1 196 508   -   -   -   -   Lease liability 423 478 675 521 72 652 68 754 65 981 64 942 61 898 57 122 52 927 231 245 _o/w the liability on the scope to be sold_ _84 743_ _11 498_ _9 750_ _7 476_ _6 740_ _6 148_ _5 554_ _5 373 32 203_ Minority interest purchase commitment liability 24 425 24 425  -  -  -  -  -  - 24 425  Total 1 212 049 1 560 736 207 949 132 398 403 109 387 914 62 821 57 854   77 446 231 245 Derivative liabilities Interest rate swaps used for hedging  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Total - - - - - - - - - ###### Financial covenants The Group is subject to the following financial covenant at the balance sheet date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

In June 2021 (see Note 10.2.1 Bank loans), the repayment of the government-backed PGE loan was deferred by one year and its maturity was extended for a further year to June 18, 2023. The guarantee fee was increased from 0.5% to 1.0% on June 18, 2021. If the PGE loan is repaid before June 18, 2023, the Group will be required to pay the guarantee fee up until this date. ##### 11.

Accordingly, the effective tax rate in the interim financial statements may differ from management's estimate of the effective tax rate in the annual financial statements.

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and reviewed under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits. These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the President. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these Interim Consolidated Financial Statements based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the professional doctrine of the French national auditing body (Compagnie nationale des _commissaires aux comptes) related to this engagement. A review consists primarily of making_ inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical procedures.

Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESS ###### Burger King France S.A.S. is a French simplified joint-stock company (SAS) that has its registered office at 34 Rue Mozart, 92110 Clichy. It is registered in the Paris trade register under No. 797 882 867. The Group develops and optimizes a fast-food restaurant concept that is based predominantly on hamburgers and employs various techniques, knowledge and know-how that are appropriate for this type of restaurant. The consolidated financial statements present the accounting situation of Burger King France S.A.S and its subsidiaries (together the ""Group"") and interests held in joint ventures. They are presented in euros, with figures rounded off to the nearest thousand. The Group's financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 were approved by the Chairman on 31 March 2021 and will be proposed for approval at the forthcoming annual shareholders meeting. ----- ##### 2. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2019 AND POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS ###### 2.1. Significant events of 2019 2020 was marked by the following significant events. Covid-19 health crisis The year 2020 was marked by the Covid-19 health crisis and by the consequences of the French government's measures to stop the pandemic from spreading, which included: - the closure of restaurants on 14 March 2020 until at least 15 April 2020. - the lockdown requirement, announced on 16 March 2020, requiring everyone residing in France remain at home unless absolutely necessary, until at least 31 March 2020. This lockdown period was subsequently extended. As soon as the Burger King France Group learned of the government's initial measures, it closed all Burger King and Quick restaurants. Initially, all restaurants were unable to provide takeaway and/or home delivery service. It quickly became apparent that it would take some time until the Group's restaurants would be able to ensure that their employees and customers were protected from the coronavirus. With the exception of a few restaurants for which drive and home delivery sales resumed at the end of April 2020, to enable us to test our pandemic safety measures, the vast majority remained closed for all business until May 6, 2020. As this time and until the end of June, we gradually reopened our restaurants for drive and home delivery service, subject to strict health safety requirements. At the start of June, we were able to resume sales in our restaurants, while complying with social distancing rules. Takeaway and ""Click n' Collect"" sales were also developed. In the third quarter of 2020, we opened all of our restaurants with full service, with the exception of those in airports, train stations and other locations highly dependent on tourism. We observed a strong recovery in business, despite the impact of the mandatory closures of some locations. From 30 October 2020, until 15 December 2020, the French government imposed a second nationwide lockdown, which was followed by a 9pm curfew until the end of the year. Unlike during the first lockdown, we were allowed to maintain drive, home delivery, take-away and Click n' Collect service. Only dining areas had to be closed. With the experience gained during the first lockdown, we were able to keep all of our restaurants open (except for those in city centers, shopping malls and ""tourist"" areas), albeit under deteriorated business conditions. Given the uncertainty of the health crisis, when the restaurant closures were announced in March, the Group immediately decided to draw down all of its available credit lines, and most significantly the €60 million RCF line (see Note 10.2). ----- ###### The Group also immediately worked with its creditors to obtain a government-guaranteed ""PGE"" loan for €80 million at the end of the first half of the year (see Note 10.2). After securing this loan, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million on the RCF line and thus reduce its use to €20 million (see Note 10.2). To support its franchisees during this period, the Group also agreed to temporary concessions on royalty payments in formal amendments to franchise agreements. This included the waiver of guaranteed minimum royalties during lockdown periods, and the implementation of variable royalty schedules to support the resumption of business activity as of 6 May 2020. These temporary measures resulted in a decrease in royalties and other revenue from franchisees (see Note 6.1.2). During all phases of lockdown and depressed business activity, the Group implemented cost containment measures to reduce the impact of restaurant closures and the sharp drop in or complete lack of in-restaurant sales. These measures included, but were not limited to, the following: • Short-time work schedules for restaurant and support staff (see Note 7.2) • Suspension or termination of service contracts whenever possible • Negotiations with our main partners, insurers, suppliers, and in particular lessors, the impact of which may be seen in our 2020 accounts. These measures reduced cash consumption during the first lockdown, partially offset operating losses, and reduced fixed costs in subsequent periods. Despite the significant impact of the Covid-19 crisis on its restaurants, the Group has ensured that it has sufficient liquidity to cover its short and medium-term obligations, for itself and for each of its subsidiaries. The ability of the Group and its subsidiaries to continue as going concerns is therefore not at risk. Business development After opening 25 restaurants in 2019 (including 22 under the Burger King® brand) and converting 29 restaurants previously operated under the Quick® brand to the Burger King® brand, the Group continued to expand in 2020 with: The opening of 21 new restaurants, including 20 operated under the Burger King® brand The conversion to the Burger King® brand of 9 restaurants formerly operating under the Quick® brand. A significant portion of the investments for this development was assumed by the lessors or supported by the Group's franchisees, thus limiting the Group's remaining net investment. System-wide sales The Group's system-wide sales totaled €1.08 billion at 31 December 2020, of which €889 million was from continuing operations (€245 million less than the previous year) and €193 million from discontinued operations (for a year-on-year decrease €34 million). The decrease in the Group's system-wide sales is mainly attributable to: • The Covid-19 crisis and its impact on restaurant operations • The permanent closure or sale of five Quick restaurants However, this decline was partially offset by the opening of 21 restaurants (of which 20 under the Burger King® brand) and the conversion of 9 Quick® restaurants to Burger King®. ----- ###### 2.2. Post-balance sheet events The beginning of 2021 was marked by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and the French government's new health measures, which included a 6pm curfew, the closure of large shopping centers, and local lockdown restrictions on weekends. Despite these measures, the vast majority of the Group's restaurants continued to operate, albeit under less favorable conditions. ----- ##### 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION ###### 3.1. Declaration of conformity The consolidated financial statements of the Burger King France Group for 2020 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the IASB as adopted mandatorily in the European Union at 31 December 2020, and with SIC and IFRIC interpretations thereof.  All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-andsupplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adoptinginternational-accounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric ###### 3.2. Changes in the accounting framework Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2020 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2020 are: • Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of ""significant"" • Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Benchmark Reform (Phase 1) • Amendments to IFRS 3 - Definition of a Business • Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards • Amendment to IFRS 16 - Leases: Covid-19 related rent concessions granted to lessees, applicable as of 1 June 2020. Note: the consequences of the IFRS IC's decision published in December 2019 on the terms of lease within the scope of IFRS 16 have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2020, by retrospectively amending the 2019 consolidated financial statements (see Note 3.6). Apart from the changes to IFRS 16 (the effects of which are explained in Note 3.6), the other standards had no impact on the Group's accounts. Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2021 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2021: - Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 - Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Reform of benchmark interest rates (Phase 2). At the time of this publication, the Group does not expect these new standards to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. ----- ###### 3.3. Use of estimates and judgments In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements. The Group's management makes these estimates and assessments on an ongoing basis, based on past experience and various factors it considers to be reasonable. Unexpected changes in events and circumstances, and particularly in the economic environment of the Group's business activity, may cause its financial results to differ from these estimates. The most significant estimates and judgments that the management of Burger King France Group has made in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant impact on its financial statements mainly have to do with: • Impairment tests on fixed assets and goodwill (Note 8.4) • The measurement of rights of use and lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16 (Notes 8.3.2) 3.4. Methods used to translate foreign currency transactions The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's functional currency. Amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand euros, unless otherwise stated. Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement. 3.5. Basis of assessment The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivatives which are measured at fair value. 3.6. Impacts of the application of the IFRS IC decision issued on 16 December 2019"" 3.6.1. PRINCIPLE ###### On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC issued a decision clarifying the determination of the terms for leases within the scope of IFRS 16 - Leases, and in particular: - the determination of the enforceable period of a lease that is automatically renewable or which has an indefinite term, and which may be terminated by a party to the lease with due notice. One of the issues raised was the concept of ""penalty"", which serves to determine the enforceable period. - the link between the depreciation period for fixtures and fittings that cannot be separated from the leased asset, and the term of the lease under IFRS 16. ----- ###### The IFRS IC has: - concluded that an economic (rather than a strictly legal) approach should be used to determine a lease's enforceable period - clarified the link between the IFRS 16 lease term and the depreciation period for fixtures and fittings that cannot be separated from the leased asset. In determining the IFRS 16 terms of French ""3/6/9"" leases, which moreover are automatically renewable, the Group has also taken into consideration the conclusions of the ANC (the French accounting standards authority), issued on July 3, 2020 and which supersede those of 16 February 2018. The Group has conducted analyses to determine the effects of this and made the necessary changes to its financial and accounting information systems in the second half of 2020. The main impact of the ANC's decision was to extend the IFRS 16 term of certain leases and increase the rights of use and commitments for these leases correspondingly. The impacts of this change in accounting policy were recognized retrospectively as of the IFRS 16 transition date, i.e. 1 January 2019. The consolidated financial statements for 2019 have also been restated in accordance with this decision. Our analyses focused in particular on leases of underlying assets (restaurants) with inseparable fixtures and fittings and a residual net book value at the end of the IFRS 16 term that could result in a significant penalty (within the meaning of the IFRS IC decision) for the Group. For such leases, it was sometimes necessary to extend the IFRS 16 lease term. 3.6.2. **IMPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ###### The Group has opted to observe the simplified retrospective method as of 1 January 2019. The 2018 financial statements have thus not been restated.  The total impact of the application of IFRS 16 and the IFRS IC's decision on the balance sheet is €417.7 million at January 1, 2019 (vs. €374.5 million in the 2019 consolidated financial statements).

CONSOLIDATION SCOPE ###### 4.1. Accounting principles observed for the scope of consolidation ###### Consolidation of subsidiaries ###### A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. The Group controls a company when it is exposed to, or is entitled to, variable returns from its relationship with the company and may have an impact on these returns through its control over the company. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date that such control is initially obtained and until it ceases. ###### Equity method of accounting for joint ventures ###### A joint venture is a form of partnership that gives the Group joint control over a company and rights to the net assets of the joint venture, but no rights to its assets or obligations in respect of its liabilities. Burger King France uses the equity method to account for its joint ventures. ###### 4.2. Business combinations ###### Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities are generally recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date. ###### Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any interest previously held in the acquiree) plus the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognized (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Non- controlling interests are measured when control is gained, either pro rata to the identifiable net assets or at fair value, depending on the option selected. ###### When the difference thus determined is negative, and after the various components are remeasured, it can be immediately taken to income, in ""other non-recurring income and expenses"". ###### Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment loss. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement and are irreversible. ----- ###### The table below shows the calculation of goodwill from the Group's acquisition of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Acquisition expenses are recorded in ""Other non-current operating expenses"". No significant costs were recognized in 2020. The contribution of these companies to sales and franchise income and to annual income, from their date of acquisition to 31 December 2020, is immaterial. ----- ###### 4.3. Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities held for sale ###### A non-current asset or a group of associated assets and liabilities is considered to be held for sale in the following cases, in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”: • the asset or group is available for immediate sale in its present condition • its sale is highly likely, which is the case when management has undertaken efforts to sell the asset or group and to find a buyer at a reasonable price and has committed to sell it within one year. Non-current assets, groups of assets or businesses held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value (i.e. the estimated selling price), net of disposal costs. They are presented on a separate line on the balance sheet and are no longer depreciated or amortized. Joint ventures are no longer accounted for using the equity method. A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's operations which has business activities and cash flows that are clearly distinct from those of the rest of the Group, and which: • represents a major and distinct line of business or geographic area • is part of a coordinated plan to divest a major and distinct line of business or geographic area, or • is a subsidiary acquired exclusively to be resold. The classification takes place on the date of disposal or earlier if the activity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had met the criteria of a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period. ###### In order to focus on the development of the Burger King brand in France, since 2019 the Group has been reorganizing Quick's business activities into a separate group of companies to facilitate their sale. During the first year, the restrictive measures imposed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus prevented the formal launching of the process to sell Quick business activities. However, throughout this period, the Group took the necessary steps to prepare for this sale, which included setting up a dedicated management structure and proceeding with the legal reorganization of the businesses to be sold. In view of this reorganization and the steps already taken, the Group considers that the sale of this business is very likely within the next twelve months and that it meets the IFRS 15 classification criteria. ----- 4.3.1. **ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE ###### The group of companies to be sold consists of the following assets and liabilities at 31 December 2020 In 000 EUR_ **Dec. 2020** **Dec. 2019 Goodwill 47 584 45 193 Intangible assets 113 053 113 018 Property, plant and equipment 124 289 103 277 Inventories 91 124 Trade and other receivables 12 058 7 163 Cash and cash equivalents 2 031 2 700 Assets held for sale 299 106 271 475 Lease liabilities 59 903 54 188 Trade and other payables 13 414 6 912 Liabilities held for sale 73 317 61 100 ###### The above assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value.

The non-controlling interests are: • The sub-group consisting of Agaquick SAS and its subsidiaries, in which the Group has a 50% stake • BK Expansion, 84.44% of which is owned by the Group • BK Développement, 73.12% of which is owned by the Group • Flagship, 50.71% of which is owned by the Group • BK Croissance and BK Exploitation, of which the Group holds 3.21% • SL2R and its subsidiary ADFR, 55.08% of which is owned by the Group • SN2R and its subsidiary Houdemont, 76.91% of which is owned by the Group. As at 31 December 2019, only the investment in the Agaquick sub-group was material for the Group at 31 December 2020. The following table presents the key financial figures of this wholly owned sub-group before intra- group eliminations.

Share-based compensation The fair value of performance shares granted to employees is recognized in income in ""other non-current expenses"" over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. This fair value was determined using an EBITDA-multiple model, the terms of vesting plans, the market data available at the grant date and the assumptions of the Group’s management. For its RSU plan, implemented in 2018, the Group recognized an expense of €75 thousand in 2020, vs. €2.7 million in 2019. 7.5. Compensation of key management personnel (related parties) In 2020, key executives received compensation of €3.0 million, compared to €3.1 million in 2019. This compensation includes the salaries of these executives, benefits in kind, contributions to defined contribution post-employment benefit plans and the expense of defined benefit post-employment plan. These executives are also entitled to RSU (see Note 7.4). ----- ##### 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PPE ###### 8.1. Goodwill Goodwill is mainly attributable to the following: • in December 2015, the acquisition by Burger King France SAS of 100% of the capital of Financière Quick SAS (€171 million), less the proceeds from the disposal of operations in Belgium and Luxembourg in 2016 (€44 million) • in 2017, the acquisition of BDBK and PINTO (€76 million) • in 2018, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€9 million) • in 2019, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€2 million) • in 2020, the acquisition of four individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€2 million) and the increase in individually immaterial company business goodwill (€869 thousand) • the classification, since December 31, 2019, of the Quick business goodwill as an asset held for sale.

SEGMENT INFORMATION ###### Under IFRS 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity: ###### • that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses • whose operational results are regularly monitored by the chief operating decision maker • for which separate financial information is available. The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") is its Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Group's business activity, which constitutes a single operating segment, is operating restaurants in France under franchise agreements or which it owns. Note 6.1 provides a breakdown of revenue by type of product and service, with a distinction between merchandise sales by company-owned restaurants and income from franchise agreements.  All sales are generated in France. No individual customer is of significant size. ----- ##### 6. OPERATIONS INFORMATION ###### 6.1. Sales and franchise revenues ###### Sales and franchise income consist of: • the sales of foodservice products and services through company-operated restaurants within the scope of IFRS 15 • brand royalties and other income paid by franchisees within the scope of IFRS 15 • sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees • entry fees and other sales, which include network access fees and entry fees invoiced to franchisees and revenue from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees.

Sales revenue is recognized when the control of the products sold (the ""merchandise"") is transferred to the customer, i.e. when payment is made at the cash register for sales to consumers in company-operated restaurants. Revenue is valued net of returns, rebates, trade discounts and quantity discounts. ###### Sales to consumers amounted to €178.3 million in 2020, vs. €290.4 million in 2019, for a decrease of €112.1 million. This decrease is mainly due to the Covid-19 crisis measures, and to a lesser extent to the transfer of eight directly operated restaurants to a franchisee and the closure of one directly operated restaurant. This decrease was partially offset by three new directly operated restaurants, two of which were previously operated under a franchise agreement and one of which was opened. ----- 6.1.2. **ROYALTIES AND OTHER CHARGES TO FRANCHISEES ###### The various types of franchise agreements are: full franchise, shared franchise, business lease, and business lease with investment. The percentage paid depends on the type of agreement. Royalties and other charges to franchisees (excluding rent) comprise: • the royalties received from franchisees for the use of the Burger King® and Quick® brands. • National advertising fees received from franchisees as their contribution to the national advertising budget • Business lease fees received from the leasing of Group-owned businesses. Brand royalties Each month, franchisees are invoiced for brand royalties, the amount of which is a contractual percentage of their sales and other income. These royalties are recognized when the franchise revenue is earned, in accordance with the royalty exemption provided for under IFRS 15, with the exception of annual guaranteed minimums which are recognized on a straight-line basis. National advertising charges Franchisees are billed monthly for their contribution to the national advertising budget, which is a percentage of the franchise's revenue. It is recorded when this revenue is earned, as it is considered that national advertising activities do not apply to any service that is distinct from the license to use the brand and the know-how. Business lease royalties As lessor, Burger King France Group has entered into real property leases and business leases (with or without investment) with its franchisees. The term of business leases is 9+9 years for Burger King® restaurants, and from 3 to 12 years for Quick restaurants. The royalties paid under these leases are a contractual percentage of the franchise revenue and are invoiced in consideration of the use of the business assets, the occupation of the premises and the leasehold interest. These business leases are operating leases for the lessor under IFRS 16. Lease payments are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. ###### The Group had 325 franchised restaurants at 31 December 2020, vs. 304 at 31 December 2019. The total transaction price for services that were not fully provided at the balance sheet date is immaterial. Franchise royalties totaled €149.3 million in 2020, which is €27.4 million less than in 2019 (€176.7 million). This decrease is mainly attributable to: • the impact of the Covid-19 measures on the sales of our franchisees ----- ###### • the Group's efforts to support franchisees during the Covid-19 crisis, which included temporary concessions on royalty payments in formal amendments to franchise agreements, the waiver of guaranteed minimum royalties during lockdown periods, and the implementation of variable royalty schedules to support the resumption of business activity. • the Group's direct operation of two restaurants previously operated under franchise agreements • the permanent closure or sale of four restaurants. This decrease was partially offset by the transfer of eight restaurants previously operated to franchisees and the opening of 19 restaurants under franchise agreements.

Revenue from the sale of merchandise and equipment is recognized when their control is transferred to the franchisee, which is the invoice date. ###### Sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees totaled €2.9 million in 2020 vs. €7.5 million in 2019. This decrease is mainly due to the Group's outsourcing, late in Q1 2019, of its purchasing and logistics business for its Quick® restaurants. However, subsidiary Logirest still continues to directly operate an equipment sales and logistics business. ----- 6.1.4. **ENTRY FEES AND OTHER SALES ###### Network entry and franchise entry fees. Network entry and franchise entry fees are charged to franchisees in consideration of the transfer of know-how, the use of the brand, territorial exclusivity and assistance in opening a restaurant. They are invoiced at the start of the contract. As with brand royalties, they are considered to be remuneration for the license to use the trademark and know-how, and not remuneration for distinct services. As this is a ""variable license"" within the meaning of IFRS 15, this income is recognized over the term of the franchise agreement, and on a straight-line basis, since it is considered that the Group's services as a franchisor are provided uniformly over the term of the agreement. Fees invoiced at the start of the contract that have not yet been recognized in ""Sales and franchise income"" are recognized in current and non-current deferred income. Other revenue Other revenue consist mainly of the from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees.

Lessees are required to recognize all leases (with some exceptions) in a way that is largely similar to the method required for finance leases under IAS 17, i.e. recognizing as an asset the right to use the underlying leased asset, and as a lease liability the obligation to pay lease payments over the lease term. However, the standard provides for exemptions for leases of 12 months or less an leases for low-value assets. The Group has used these two exemptions.  Under IFRS 16, a contract or part of a contract is or contains a lease if it grants the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has observed IFRS 16 in accordance with the simplified retrospective method, which recommends recording the cumulative effect of the adoption of IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the balance of reserves at 1 January 2019.  The Group presents the ""rights of use"" asset in the statement of financial position under property, plant and equipment on the same line as the underlying asset of the same nature that it owns in full, and presents lease liabilities on the ""current/non-current lease liabilities"" lines of ""current/non-current financial liabilities"".  The Group recognizes a ""right-of-use"" asset and a lease liability at the inception of the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, with possible adjustment to account for certain revaluations of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments due but not yet paid at the start date of the contract. The discount rate used corresponds to the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if this cannot be easily determined, the marginal borrowing rate (based on the lending term and not the maturity date). The Group uses the marginal borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is then increased by the interest expense and reduced by the amount of the lease payments. It is remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments subsequent to a change in an index or rate or to a re-estimation of the amount payable under a residual value guarantee, or in the event of a revaluation of the exercise of a purchase option or the extension or non-exercise of a termination option (in which case said payments becomes reasonably certain). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on rights of use and lease liabilities, considering that tax deductions on lease payments are attributable to the liability and then offset. On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC issued its final decision on the assessment of lease terms and depreciation periods for immovable fixtures and fittings, deeming it unnecessary to amend IFRS 16 to clarify the concept of ""enforceable period"".  With this decision, the Committee seeks to clarify the method used to determine the lease term, since it does not accept the legal approach of determining the period during which a lease is enforceable solely on the basis of the terms of the lease agreement. The Committee thus considers that a lease remains enforceable for as long as the lessee or the lessor would suffer a significant loss if the lease were terminated. Accordingly, even in the absence of an option that enables the lessee to extend a lease at its discretion, the reasonably certain term of the lease must be assessed to determine the corresponding lease liability and the value of the right of use. In the ----- ###### Committee's view, the concept of ""loss"" should be considered broadly and not limited to contractual or monetary penalties.   With regard to the depreciation period for immovable fittings and fixtures, the Committee notes that: - The term of a lease should be taken into account when determining the depreciation period of the fittings and fixtures - The existence of fixtures or fittings that are not fully depreciated and which would have to be abandoned and removed if the lease is terminated is one example of a loss to be considered when determining the lease's enforceable period. In determining the IFRS 16 terms of French ""3/6/9"" leases, which moreover are automatically renewable, the Group has also taken into consideration the conclusions of the ANC (the French accounting standards authority), issued on July 3, 2020 and which supersede those of 16 February 2018. LEASE PREMIUMS A lease premium is inseparable from the lease itself since the lessee could not have entered into the lease agreement without incurring the cost of the lease premium and would not have incurred that cost if it had not been able to enter into the lease agreement. Therefore, the lease premium is a direct cost initially incurred by the Group as lessee that is included in the initial measurement of the right of use. It was considered that the right of use is composed of the following two significant and distinct elements, which need to be amortized separately as their future economic benefits are consumed at different rates: - the lease premium - the other leasehold interests that constitute the right of use. For the lease premium, an analysis of the relevant restaurants showed that in the vast majority of cases the restaurant's location and ""premium"" characteristics ensured that the lease premium's value at the end of the lease would be at least equivalent to its current value. Accordingly, this component was not amortized. The other components of the right of use are amortized over the useful life of the right of use, which is the lease term. ----- ###### The table below breaks down rights of use by type. 2020",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Impairment of intangible assets ###### Whenever warranted by a significant internal or external event or circumstance, the Group performs impairment tests on its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and assets under construction are also tested annually for impairment. The Group performed asset impairment tests at the following two levels: • On each Cash Generating Unit (CGU), which is defined as the smallest group of assets whose cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets. For the Group, each restaurant corresponds to a CGU, whether directly operated or franchised. The net book value of CGUs includes all tangible and intangible assets, except for the brand and goodwill. • At the level of the group of CGUs which comprise the Group as a whole, including goodwill, the brand and all other tangible and intangible assets, since it is at this level that the Group can monitor the synergy gains of business combinations. ###### This impairment test consists of comparing the recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) with its carrying amount, including rights of use. The recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) is the higher of its value in use or its fair value less the cost of disposal. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of assets. Cash flow projections are based on the Group's five-year business plan restated for the new IFRS 16 standard (lease cancellation) and are extrapolated to infinity at a long-term growth rate. Cash flows are discounted at the WACC based on market assumptions. This rate is calculated using the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and a size premium. It does not include the Group's debt and tax structure. When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value of the asset or group of assets tested, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In the case of a group of assets, the impairment is initially charged to goodwill. If the recoverable amount of an asset other than goodwill rises back above its net book value at a later date the impairment loss recognized on this asset may be reversed. This reversal cannot exceed the impairment loss initially recorded less any depreciation or amortization that would otherwise have been recognized. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed. ----- 8.4.1. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF RESTAURANT CGUs ###### The Group individually tested 309 restaurants that had been in operation for at least 12 months at 31 December 2020.

For the CGUs that are not impaired, management has determined that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The Group has individually re-tested the non-impaired CGUs by changing the key valuation assumptions as follows: • Increasing the discount rate from 7% to 7.50% • Decreasing the perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value, from 2% to 1.50% • Decreasing the sales growth rate over the 5-year business plan from 1.50% to 0.50% These changes had no material impact on the impairment of restaurant CGUs individually or in aggregate. ----- 8.4.2. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE ###### The recoverable amount of the Group as a whole was assessed on the basis of its value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions: Discount rate 7.00% 8.10% Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00% Sales growth rate over the five years of the business plan * 1.50% 1.50% - This growth rate is not applied until 2022 (when management considers that business will have recovered from the Covid19 crisis). ###### The Group's estimated recoverable amount at 31 December 2020 exceeds its carrying amount by approximately €593 million.

In 2020, the changes concern disputes with employees and tax authorities. The Group is also involved in several legal proceedings with another of France Quick's former international master franchisee, for which the Group has made no provision as it does not consider this risk to be material. The change in provisions for commercial, legal and employee dispute risks in 2019 is mainly explained by the reversal of the provision recognized in 2016 for a dispute with a former France Quick international master franchisee. In an arbitration decision issued in the second quarter of 2019, the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris found France Quick's decision to terminate its franchise and brand agreements on the grounds of an irremediable breach to be wrongful and ordered France Quick to compensate this former franchisee for its expenses and investments. The provision recognized over the previous years was therefore reversed and the associated expense was recorded under ""Other non-recurring income and expenses"", and the attachment was released. ----- ##### 10.

Of this €80 million loan, €60 million was allocated to France Quick and €20 million to Burger King France. The loan was arranged with a pool of three banks and is backed by a 90% government guarantee.  Although no interest was due in 2020, there is a guarantee fee of 0.5%.  The term of the loan is 12 months. It may be extended annually for up to five years. Although the Group may automatically extend the term of this loan beyond the initial 12 months, it is classified as a current liability since it may immediately fall due if significant assets are disposed of. Since the planned disposal of the Quick business (see Note 4.3) would meet this criterion, for reasons of consistency this loan has been classified as current debt, even though the Group plans to have the loan automatically extended pending the completion of this disposal. ----- ###### Bond issues The table below shows the key characteristics of the Group's bond issues: In 000 EUR_ **Carrying amount** **Nominal** **Maturity** **Repayment** **Rate",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

This tranche was issued in two phases: initially on 21 April 2017 for €250 million, with proceeds of 99.5% and the balance recognized as an issuance discount, and subsequently on 19 December 2017 for €60 million, with proceeds of 101.75% and the balance recognized as an issuance premium. Burger King France may call some or all of these bonds. The €16.9 million in bond issuance costs are spread over the term of the bond. They were €8.8 million at 31 December 2020, vs. €11.4 million at 31 December 2019. This change is explained by the spreading out of bond issuance costs in 2020.

The current margin is Euribor +2.5%, with a 0% floor. As soon as the announcement was made that restaurants would close in March 2020, the Group decided to draw down all of its €60 million RCF line. At the end of June, the Group used its available cash to repay €40 million of the RCF line, thus reducing the used portion to €20 million. At December 31, 2020, €20 million of this line of credit had been used. If over 35% of the RCF is used, the Group's quarterly leverage ratio (EBITDA / net debt) must not exceed 7.5. Although this ratio was exceeded at December 31, 2020, the covenant did not apply since less than 35% of the RCF was used. 10.2.2. **CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ###### Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term deposits with banks.

The difference between the liability thus recorded and the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. After its initial recognition, the liability is carried at amortized cost and subsequent changes are recognized in equity. In the consolidated income statement, a share of the net income of the Agaquick sub-group is allocated to the non-controlling interests that are still entitled to a share of the subsidiary's earnings. The Group has granted Picpain a put option on its interest in Agaquick. The exercise price of this option was calculated using a contractually predetermined formula. The option may be exercised in 2027. Since the non-controlling interests are still entitled to their share of Agaquick's earnings, the Group has opted for a ""mixed"" accounting treatment of this commitment. 1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement. The Group also has an option to purchase all of the shares that Picpain holds in Agaquick, which it may exercise pursuant to the shareholders' agreement in 2039, or in the event of a change in the ownership structure of Picpain's Agaquick shares, or in the event of a legal dispute for which Picpain is held liable. ----- ###### 10.3.

Risk management 10.4.1. **GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY ###### The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate and currency risks. The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its floating-rate debt. To manage this risk the Group uses caps or swaps with first-class counterparties. Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies. The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health. 10.4.2. **INTEREST RATE RISK ###### The Group used caps and swaps in 2020 to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives are qualified as cash flow hedging instruments. Hedging is considered to be effective if the Euribor fixing on the hedged loan is strictly equivalent to the fixing of the hedging instrument. In 2019, the Group also used caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives, which were designated as cash flow hedging instruments, are shown in the table below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

There were no currency hedging commitments at 31 December 2019 or 31 December 2020. Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk the latter had no material impact on income (as in 2019). 10.4.4. **CREDIT RISK ###### Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group. Deposits and guarantees The credit risk on deposits and guarantees is considered to be limited. Cash and cash equivalents With regard to cash and cash equivalents, the credit risk is considered to be limited insofar as: • they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day- to-day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles. • they are invested exclusively in money market instruments. Trade receivables Trade receivables are the amounts owed by franchisees. They may be impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. Indicators of incurred losses include, for example, significant financial difficulties of a franchisee or a breach of the franchise agreement (e.g. payment is past due more than x days). These receivables deemed to be at risk are fully impaired if there are indicators of incurred credit loss. The provision for such losses totaled €6.9 million at 31 December 2020, vs. €3.3 million at 31 December 2019. The main change between 2019 and 2020 is attributable to an assessment of the risk of non-recovery of €2.7 million of the business lease fees for March 2020, the payment dates for which were deferred throughout 2021. A statistics-based provision is made for receivables that are not impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. This statistical provision is based on the history of credit losses actually incurred over the past ten years. At 31 December 2020, this provision was €64 thousand, vs. €78 thousand at 31 December 2019. Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables. 10.4.5. **LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE ###### The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity. ----- ###### The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short-term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities. Current debt includes the €80 million government-guaranteed ""PGE"" loan (see Note 10.2). However, the Group plans to allow this loan to be automatically extended beyond its initial 12-month term and to repay it when the Quick business is disposed of (see Note 4.3). The Group therefore believes that it has sufficient resources to cover the €214 million in current liabilities, which include the 80 million PGE loan that will immediately fall due if the Quick business is sold.

The Group applied the new standard IFRS 16 – Leases – on January 1, 2019, following the procedure described in Note 3.6 “Effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 16” to the consolidated financial statements. We have obtained an understanding of the procedures implemented by the Group to identify the leases within the scope of IFRS 16 standard. For a sample of contracts, we have also reconciled the data considered by the management to determine the assets and liabilities related to the leases with specific data from underlying agreements, assessed the criteria taken into account by the management to determine the residual lease term with underlying agreements, assessed the appropriateness of the ----- KPMG S.A. EXELMANS AUDIT & CONSEIL Tour Eqho - 2, avenue Gambetta – CS 60055 21, rue de Téhéran 92066 Paris La Défense Cedex 75008 Paris France France methodology used to determine the discount rate at the date of the first-time application, recalculated the amounts of the right-of-use assets and the lease commitments as re-measured and recognized by the Company as at January 1, 2019, and assessed the appropriateness of the information related to the impacts of the application of IFRS 16 standard in Note 3.6 to the consolidated financial statements. The Group applied IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations – following the procedure described in Note 4.3 “Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities held for sales” to the consolidated financial statements. We have assessed the correct application of the standard, the related impacts and disclosures. In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 8.4 to the consolidated financial statements, “Impairment of intangible assets”,  goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are subject to impairment tests. We have analyzed the methods of implementation of the impairment tests as well as the cash flow forecasts and assumptions used by the management to perform impairment tests, and we have assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 8.4. As stated in Note 8.13 to the consolidated financial statements, “Long-term provisions”, a provision is recorded when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation. Concerning the ongoing litigation with the former franchisee operating in Tunisia, as described in Note 8.13 “Long-term provisions” to the consolidated financial statements, based on information available as of today, we have appreciated the amount of the provision by obtaining an understanding of the process implemented by the Company with the support of its external counsels to estimate the provision. We have assessed reasonable assurance on the estimate and the information disclosed in the note 8.13 “Long-term provisions” to the consolidated financial statements. ----- KPMG S.A.

44_5,Final Offerings 2021.md,925,KPMG** **EXELMANS,925.13,Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,925.13.1,,"Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ----- KPMG S.A.

THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESS ###### Burger King France S.A.S. is a French simplified joint-stock company (SAS). It has its registered office at 50, avenue du Président Wilson 93200, in the city of Saint Denis and is registered in the Paris trade register under No. 797 882 867. The Group develops and optimizes a fast-food restaurant concept that is based predominantly on hamburgers and employs various techniques, knowledge and know-how that are appropriate for this type of restaurant. The consolidated financial statements present the accounting situation of Burger King France S.A.S and its subsidiaries (together the ""Group"") and interests held in joint ventures. They are presented in euros, with figures rounded off to the nearest thousand. The Group's financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 were approved by the Chairman on 20 March 2020 and will be proposed for approval at the forthcoming annual shareholders meeting. ----- ##### 2. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2019 AND POST-BALANCE SHEET ###### EVENTS 2.1. Significant events of 2019 2019 was marked by the following significant events. Contributions to the scope of discontinued operations In order to prepare for the disposal of discontinued operations, in 2019 the Group continued its legal and real estate reorganization begun in 2018, by contributing, transfering or selling goodwill, construction leases, commercial leases and all related PPE investments to the above-mentioned discontinued scope of operations, which concerns 54 restaurants (See Note 4.3). Business development After opening 25 restaurants in 2018 (including 24 under the Burger King® brand) and converting 63 restaurants previously operated under the Quick® brand to the Burger King® brand, the Group continued to expand in 2019 with: • The opening of 25 new restaurants, including 22 operated under the Burger King® brand • The conversion to the Burger King® brand of 29 restaurants formerly operating under the Quick® brand. A significant portion of the investments for this development was assumed by the lessors or supported by the Group's franchisees, thus limiting the Group's remaining net investment. System-wide sales The Group's system-wide sales totaled €1.36 billion at 31 December 2019, of which €1.13 billion was from continuing operations (€121 million more than the previous year) and €227 million from discontinued operations (for a year- on-year increase €24 million). The increase in the Group's system-wide sales is mainly attributable to: • The opening of 25 new restaurants and the positive impact of the conversion of 29 Quick® restaurants to the Burger King® brand • The full-year effect of the restaurant openings and conversions to the Burger King® brand of Quick® restaurants completed in 2018 • The good performance of Quick® restaurants on a like-for-like basis in 2019. Acquisitions During the year, the Group acquired interests in seven new companies that operate nine Burger King® restaurants (See Notes 4.2 and 4.4). Outsourcing of the purchasing and logistics of Quick® restaurants During 2019, the Group outsourced the purchasing and logistics activities of its chain of Quick restaurants in mainland France. These activities were previously carried out directly by the Group via its dedicated subsidiary ""Logirest"". ----- ###### This outsourcing results in a decrease in sales and franchise revenues (see Note 6.1) and a decrease in the cost of supplies and merchandise (see Note 6.2). 2.2. Post-balance sheet events After 2020 got off to a start that was broadly in line with its business plan, the Group saw its system-wide sales drop in early March as a result of the Covid-19 health crisis. Following the measures decided by the French government to prevent the spread of the Covid virus, and in particular the executive orders of March 14 and 15, 2020 and the decree and order of March 16, 2020, all of the Group's restaurants are currently closed. In terms of financial management, the Group, which had available cash of 105 million euros at the end of February 2020 and an unused credit line of 60 million euros, has decided to draw 100% of this credit line and to apply for the government's support measures, which include deferred payment of social security and tax charges. In order to cope with the lack of sales as of 15 March over a period of several weeks, the Group undertook various cost-reduction and investment measures, including in particular the implementation of short-time work schedules for employees. Giving this unprecedented context and the absence of clear information on the pandemic's expected magnitude and duration, the Group is not in a position to provide specific information on the consequences these events may have on its earnings and cash position. ----- ##### 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION ###### 3.1. Declaration of conformity The consolidated financial statements of the Burger King France Group for 2019 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the IASB as adopted mandatorily in the European Union at 31 December 2019, and with SIC and IFRIC interpretations thereof.  All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-andsupplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adopting-internationalaccounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric ure-scrutiny-rps_en#individual-rps-acts-adopting-internationalaccounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric ###### 3.2. Changes in the accounting framework Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2019 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2019 are: • IFRS 16 – Leases: see Note 3.6 and 8.3.2 • Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation • IFRIC Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments • Amendments to IAS 28 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures • Amendments to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement • IFRS annual improvements – 2015-2017 cycle. Apart from IFRS 16 (the effects of which are explained in Notes 3.6 and 8.3.2), the other standards had no impact on the Group's accounts. In particular, the Group has no significant tax uncertainties within the scope of IFRIC 23. Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2020 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2020: - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Materiality - Amendment of references in the standards to the conceptual framework - Amendments to IFRS 3 – Definition of a business. At the time of this publication, the Group does not expect these new standards to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. ----- ###### 3.3. Use of estimates and judgments In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements. The Group's management makes these estimates and assessments on an ongoing basis, based on past experience and various factors it considers to be reasonable. Unexpected changes in events and circumstances, and particularly in the economic environment of the Group's business activity, may cause its financial results to differ from these estimates. The most significant estimates and judgments that the management of Burger King France Group has made in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant impact on its financial statements mainly have to do with: • Impairment tests on fixed assets and goodwill (Note 8.4) • The measurement of rights of use and lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16 (Notes 3.6 and 8.3.2) • The recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 11.2). 3.4. Methods used to translate foreign currency transactions The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's functional currency. Amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand euros, unless otherwise stated. Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement. 3.5. Basis of assessment The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivatives which are measured at fair value. 3.6. Effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 3.6.1. **FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IFRS 16 ###### The Group adopted IFRS 16 Leases for the first time on 1 January 2019. On 13 January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 - Leases, which was adopted by the European Union on 31 October 2017. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations. It eliminates, for lessees, the different accounting treatments that previously applied to operating and finance leases. Lessees are required to recognize all leases (with some exceptions) in a way that is largely similar to the method required for finance leases under IAS 17, i.e. recognizing as an asset the right to use the underlying leased asset, and as a lease liability the obligation to pay lease payments over the lease term. ----- ###### However, the standard provides for exemptions for leases of 12 months or less an leases for low-value assets. The Group has used these two exemptions. The Group has observed IFRS 16 in accordance with the simplified retrospective method, which recommends recording the cumulative effect of the adoption of IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the balance of reserves at 1 January 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is therefore presented, as previously, in accordance with the principles of IAS 17 and its interpretations. The resulting changes to accounting policies are explained in detail below. The Group presents the ""rights of use"" asset in the statement of financial position under property, plant and equipment on the same line as the underlying asset of the same nature that it owns in full, and presents lease liabilities on the ""current/non-current lease liabilities"" lines of ""current/non-current financial liabilities"". 3.6.2. **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ###### Under IFRS 16, a contract or part of a contract is or contains a lease if it grants the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognizes a ""right-of-use"" asset and a lease liability at the inception of the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, with possible adjustment to account for certain revaluations of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments due but not yet paid at the start date of the contract. The discount rate used corresponds to the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if this cannot be easily determined, the marginal borrowing rate (based on the lending term and not the maturity date). The Group uses the marginal borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is then increased by the interest expense and reduced by the amount of the lease payments. It is remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments subsequent to a change in an index or rate or to a re- estimation of the amount payable under a residual value guarantee, or in the event of a revaluation of the exercise of a purchase option or the extension or non-exercise of a termination option (in which case said payments becomes reasonably certain). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on rights of use and lease liabilities, considering that tax deductions on lease payments are attributable to the liability and then offset. On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC issued its final decision on the assessment of lease terms and depreciation periods for immovable fixtures and fittings, deeming it unnecessary to amend IFRS 16 to clarify the concept of ""enforceable period"".  With this decision, the Committee seeks to clarify the method used to determine the lease term, since it does not accept the legal approach of determining the period during which a lease is enforceable solely on the basis of the terms of the lease agreement. The Committee thus considers that a lease remains enforceable for as long as the lessee or the lessor would suffer a significant loss if the lease were terminated. Accordingly, even in the absence of an option that enables the lessee to extend a lease at its discretion, the reasonably certain term of the lease must be assessed to determine the corresponding lease liability and the value of the right of use. In the Committee's view, the concept of ""loss"" should be considered broadly and not limited to contractual or monetary penalties. ----- ###### With regard to the depreciation period for immovable fittings and fixtures, the Committee notes that: - The term of a lease should be taken into account when determining the depreciation period of the fittings and fixtures - The existence of fixtures or fittings that are not fully depreciated and which would have to be abandoned and removed if the lease is terminated is one example of a loss to be considered when determining the lease's enforceable period. The application of this decision should not have a significant impact on the Group. LEASE PREMIUMS A lease premium is inseparable from the lease itself since the lessee could not have entered into the lease agreement without incurring the cost of the lease premium and would not have incurred that cost if it had not been able to enter into the lease agreement. Therefore, the lease premium is a direct cost initially incurred by the Group as lessee that is included in the initial measurement of the right of use. It was considered that the right of use is composed of the following two significant and distinct elements, which need to be amortized separately as their future economic benefits are consumed at different rates: - the lease premium - the other leasehold interests that constitute the right of use. For the lease premium, an analysis of the relevant restaurants showed that in the vast majority of cases the restaurant's location and ""premium"" characteristics ensured that the lease premium's value at the end of the lease would be at least equivalent to its current value. Accordingly, this component was not amortized. The other components of the right of use are amortized over the useful life of the right of use, which is the lease term. 3.6.3. **TRANSITIONAL ACCOUNTING TREATMENT ###### At the date of the transition, i.e. 1 January 2019, the lease liability for leases classified as operating leases under IAS 17 was measured at the value of the remaining lease payments discounted at the marginal euro borrowing rate of the French subsidiaries and based on the remaining lease terms and not on the initial lease terms. Right-of-use assets are valued at the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid and outstanding lease payments on the balance sheet and any benefits granted by the lessors. ----- ###### For reasons of simplification, the Group has observed the following methods and options: • The option not to recognize a ""right-of-use"" asset or a lease liability for leases with a residual term of less than 12 months • The option of not recognizing a ""right-of-use"" asset or a lease liability for leased assets worth less than five thousand euros • A term of six months is used for automatically renewed leases • The initial direct costs of the valuation of the ""right-of-use"" asset at the date of the standard's first application (excluding lease premiums that were already capitalized at 1 January 2019) were not included, except for the entry fees paid to lessors when leases were signed • The Group uses its past experience to determine the term of leases that include extension or termination options • Discount rates were calculated using the residual term at 1 January 2019 • A single discount rate was used for portfolios of leases with similar characteristics. The Group's main leases are for premises (commercial leases and construction leases), vehicles and IT equipment. The terms of real property leases and construction leases were determined as follows: • For 12-year leases with waiver of the right to terminate after each three-year period (the vast majority of leases), the term used is based on the non-cancellable 12-year term. • For 12-year leases with a 12-year renewal commitment, the term used is based on the renewed term of 24 years • For 3, 6 and 9 year leases without waiver of the three-year termination option, the term used is based on the 9-year term, provided there is no intention to terminate the lease. • For 40-year construction leases, the term is based on the 40-year non-cancellable term. These payments on these leases are fixed and may or may not be indexed. For IT equipment and vehicles, lease terms are generally from two to four years. These payments on these leases are fixed and may or may not be indexed. The Group leases, as lessee, a number of premises that previously qualified as finance leases under IAS 17. For these leases, the carrying amounts of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at 1 January 2019 were determined to be those of the underlying leased asset and the lease liability, which were calculated in accordance with IAS 17 just before that date. ----- 3.6.4. **IMPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 . 6 . 4 . 1 .

Restatements of the comparative period The comparative income statement of 2018 has been restated following the classification of Quick's business activities, which are to be disposed of as discontinued operations (see Note 4.3). The Group has also undertaken a project to improve the relevance and readability of its consolidated financial statements, which resulted in the following reclassifications: • On the Statement of Financial Position: o ""Tax receivables excluding corporate income tax"", ""Financial receivables and other current assets"" and ""Other financial receivables"" at 31 December 2018 were grouped together under ""Other current assets"". o ""Other tax liabilities"", ""Payroll and social security liabilities"" and ""Other current liabilities"" at 31 December 2018 were combined under ""Other current liabilities"". o Derivatives recorded under ""Other non-current liabilities"" at 31 December 2018 were reclassified to ""Non-current financial liabilities"". o ""Other tax receivables"" and ""Other tax payables"" at 31 December 2018 were restated to reflect the liquidation of VAT between assets and liabilities. o Prepaid expenses and deferred income on entrance fees at 31 December 2018 were restated to correct the allocation between current and non-current. • On the Income Statement: o The network entry fees and franchise entry fees were reclassified from ""Other operating income and expenses"" to ""Sales and franchise income"". o The billing of certain services to partners outside the Group were reclassified from ""Other head- office income and expenses"" to ""Sales and franchise income"". • In the cash flow statement, interest received was reclassified from ""from financing"" to ""from investment"". Certain item headings were also clarified and more information was added to the notes to the financial statements. ----- ##### 4. CONSOLIDATION SCOPE ###### 4.1. Accounting principles observed for the scope of consolidation ###### Consolidation of subsidiaries ###### A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. The Group controls a company when it is exposed to, or is entitled to, variable returns from its relationship with the company and may have an impact on these returns through its control over the company. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date that such control is initially obtained and until it ceases. ###### Equity method of accounting for joint ventures ###### A joint venture is a form of partnership that gives the Group joint control over a company and rights to the net assets of the joint venture, but no rights to its assets or obligations in respect of its liabilities. Burger King France uses the equity method to account for its joint ventures. ###### 4.2. Business combinations ###### Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities are generally recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date. ###### Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any interest previously held in the acquiree) plus the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognized (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Non- controlling interests are measured when control is gained, either pro rata to the identifiable net assets or at fair value, depending on the option selected. ###### When the difference thus determined is negative, and after the various components are remeasured, it can be immediately taken to income, in ""other non-recurring income and expenses"". ###### Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment loss. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement and are irreversible. ----- ###### The following table shows the calculation of goodwill from the Group's acquisition of companies/restaurants: % interest Cash consideration Fair value of identified net Goodwill assets Company Date control obtained Non-controlling interests[ (1)] Jeri 01/01/2019 100% 23 - (334) 357 EHRTNT 01/07/2019 100% 670 - 157 513 R2K 01/10/2019 100% 854 - 12 842 Other 150 114 118 146 (1) measured pro rata the net identifiable assets. ###### The badwill recognized in the income statement was calculated as follows: % interest Cash consideration Fair value of identified net Badwill assets Company Date control obtained Non-controlling interests[ (1)] SL2R 01/10/2019 55,08% 315 508 1 132 (309) SN2R 01/10/2019 76,91% 580 314 1 359 (465) (1) measured pro rata the net identifiable assets. ###### The cash flows arising from these acquisitions are shown below. In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Cash consideration (2 592) Cash and cash equivalents 4 372 Acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash 1 780 ###### A total of €1,730 thousand was recognized in the Cash Flow Statement for ""Acquisitions of subsidiaries, net of cash"". The difference of €50 thousand is attributable to the adjustment of the acquisition price of the subsidiaries acquired in 2018, which required the adjustment of goodwill. Acquisition expenses are recorded in ""Other non-current operating expenses"". No significant costs were recognized in 2019. From the date of their acquisition to 31 December 2019, these companies contributed €17.1 million to sales and franchise income and €0.8 million to profit. If these acquisitions had been made on 1 January 2019, the Group's consolidated sales and franchise income would have been €496.4 million and its annual profit €8.9 million. ----- ###### 4.3. Discontinued operations / Assets and liabilities held for sale ###### A non-current asset or a group of associated assets and liabilities is considered to be held for sale in the following cases, in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”: • the asset or group is available for immediate sale in its present condition • its sale is highly likely, which is the case when management has undertaken efforts to sell the asset or group and to find a buyer at a reasonable price and has committed to sell it within one year. Non-current assets, groups of assets or businesses held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value (i.e. the estimated selling price), net of disposal costs. They are presented on a separate line on the balance sheet and are no longer depreciated or amortized. Joint ventures are no longer accounted for using the equity method. A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's operations which has business activities and cash flows that are clearly distinct from those of the rest of the Group, and which: • represents a major and distinct line of business or geographic area • is part of a coordinated plan to divest a major and distinct line of business or geographic area, or • is a subsidiary acquired exclusively to be resold. The classification takes place on the date of disposal or earlier if the activity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had met the criteria of a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period. ###### In order to focus on the development of the Burger King brand in France, in 2019, the Group reorganized Quick's business activities into a distinct group of companies to facilitate their sale. In view of this reorganization and the steps already taken, the Group considers that the sale of this business is very likely within the next twelve months. ----- 4.3.1. **ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE ###### The group of companies to be sold consists of the following assets and liabilities at 31 December 2019: In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Goodwill 45 193 Intangible assets 113 018 Property, plant and equipment 103 277 Inventories 124 Trade and other receivables 7 163 Cash 2 700 Assets held for sale 271 475 Lease liabilities 54 188 Trade and other payables 6 912 Liabilities held for sale 61 100 ###### The above assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value. ----- 4.3.2. **NET INCOME OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ###### The table below shows operating income from discontinued operations, before and after tax.

Consolidation scope Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. ----- KPMG S.A. EXELMANS AUDIT & CONSEIL Tour Eqho - 2, avenue Gambetta – CS 60055 21, rue de Téhéran 92066 Paris La Défense Cedex 75008 Paris France France As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. ----- KPMG S.A.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures ----- KPMG S.A. EXELMANS AUDIT & CONSEIL Tour Eqho - 2, avenue Gambetta – CS 60055 21, rue de Téhéran 92066 Paris La Défense Cedex 75008 Paris France France responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

The companies accounted for by the equity method are joint ventures of immaterial importance. The Group has fully consolidated its 50% interest in the Agaquick sub-group since it considers that it controls Agaquick. ----- ###### 4.5. Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests are initially measured either at their fair value or at the pro rata share of the net identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date. Changes in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The non-controlling interests are: • The sub-group consisting of Agaquick SAS and its subsidiaries, in which the Group has a 50% stake • BK Expansion, 84.44% of which is owned by the Group • BK Développement, 73.12% of which is owned by the Group • Flagship, 50.71% of which is owned by the Group • BK Croissance and BK Exploitation, of which the Group holds 3.21% • SL2R and its subsidiary ADFR, 55.08% of which is owned by the Group • SN2R and its subsidiary Houdemont, 76.91% of which is owned by the Group. As at 31 December 2018, only the investment in the Agaquick sub-group was material for the Group at 31 December 2019. The following table presents the key financial figures of this wholly owned sub-group before intra-group eliminations.

Transactions with other related parties (joint ventures) There are no transactions with joint ventures. ----- ##### 5. SEGMENT INFORMATION ###### Under IFRS 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity: ###### • that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses • whose operational results are regularly monitored by the chief operating decision maker • for which separate financial information is available. The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") is its Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Group's business activity, which constitutes a single operating segment, is operating restaurants in France under franchise agreements or which it owns.  Until 31 December 2018, sales, ordinary operating income and EBITDA were broken down between franchised restaurants, company-owned restaurants and ""other activities"", which consisted of head-office support services and logistics services provided to all restaurants. However, separate data for these activities are no longer provided since they do not constitute distinct operating segments. The CODM thus allocates resources and monitors the Group's performance on the basis of more general information that is presented in accordance with: • the Group's management structure, which has no separate departments for company-owned and franchised restaurants, and with the pooling of support services; and • the internal and external reporting systems, which mainly present financial information in aggregate form. Note 6.1 provides a breakdown of revenue by type of product and service, with a distinction between merchandise sales by company-owned restaurants and income from franchise agreements.  All revenue is realized in France. No individual customer is of significant size. ----- ##### 6. OPERATIONS ###### 6.1. Sales and franchise revenues ###### Sales and franchise revenues consist of: • the sales of foodservice products and services through company-operated restaurants within the scope of IFRS 15 • brand royalties and other income paid by franchisees within the scope of IFRS 15 • sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees • entry fees and other sales, which include network access fees and entry fees invoiced to franchisees and revenue from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees. In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 restated  Note Amount % Amount % Sales to consumers 6.1.1 290 406 59% 319 567 61% Franchisee royalties 6.1.2 176 726 36% 134 992 26% Sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees 6.1.3 7 540 2% 52 977 10% Entry fees and other sales 6.1.4 15 874 3% 20 523 4% Sales and franchise revenues 490 546 100% 528 059 100% ###### * Sales and franchise revenues were restated in preparation for the planned sale of Quick's activities classified as discontinued operations (IFRS 5) as explained in Note 4.3. 6.1.1. **CONSUMER SALES ###### Revenue from sales to consumers includes the revenue from the sale of hamburgers and other food products at the Group's company-owned restaurants and of related catering services. Sales revenue is recognized when the control of the products sold (the ""merchandise"") is transferred to the customer, i.e. when payment is made at the cash register for sales to consumers in company-operated restaurants. Revenue is valued net of returns, rebates, trade discounts and quantity discounts. ###### Sales to consumers amounted to €290.4 million in 2019, compared to €319.6 million in 2018, for a decrease of €29.2 million. This decrease is mainly attributable to the reduction in the number of restaurants the Group operates directly as a result of their closure or sale, or their operation under new franchise agreements (27 restaurants). This decrease was partially offset by new restaurants the Group operates directly (11 restaurants). ----- 6.1.2. **ROYALTIES AND OTHER CHARGES TO FRANCHISEES ###### The various types of franchise agreements are: full franchise, shared franchise, business lease, and business lease with investment. The percentage paid depends on the type of agreement. Royalties and other charges to franchisees (excluding rent) comprise: • the royalties received from franchisees for the use of the Burger King® and Quick® brands. • the franchisees' contribution to the national advertising budget • Business lease fees received from the leasing of Group-owned businesses. Brand royalties Brand royalties are billed monthly to franchisees and are a contractual percentage of their revenue. These royalties are recognized when the franchise revenue is earned, in accordance with the royalty exemption provided for under IFRS 15, with the exception of annual guaranteed minimums which are recognized on a straight-line basis. National advertising charges Franchisees are billed monthly for their contribution to the national advertising budget, which is a percentage of the franchise's revenue. It is recorded when this revenue is earned, as it is considered that national advertising activities do not apply to any service that is distinct from the license to use the brand and the know-how. Business lease royalties As lessor, Burger King France Group has entered into real property leases and business leases (with or without investment) with its franchisees. The term of business leases is 9+9 years for Burger King® restaurants, and from 3 to 12 years for Quick restaurants. The royalties paid under these leases are a contractual percentage of the franchise revenue and are invoiced in consideration of the use of the business assets, the occupation of the premises and the leasehold interest. These business leases are operating leases for the lessor under IFRS 16. Lease payments are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. ###### The Group had 304 franchised restaurants at 31 December 2019, vs. 279 at 31 December 2018. The total transaction price for services that were not fully provided at the balance sheet date is immaterial. ----- ###### Franchise royalties totaled €176.7 million in 2019, which is €41.7 million more than in 2018 (€135.0 million). This increase is mainly due to (i) the transfer of 22 restaurants from Group-operated to franchised, and (ii) the opening of 22 restaurants operated by franchisees. This increase of 44 restaurants was partially offset by (iii) the Group's takeover of 9 restaurants and (iv) the definitive closure or disposal of 7 restaurants operated under franchise agreements. The table below shows future minimum lease payment receivables under non-cancellable operating leases, broken down by residual lease term: Dec. 2018 In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 restated  Less than 1 year 47 588 41 838 From the 2nd to 5th year inclusive 182 842 148 090 More than 5 years 109 576 100 704 Total minimum payments to be received 340 006 290 632 on operating leases - The total amount of minimum payment receivables was restated in view of the planned sale of Quick activities classified as discontinued operations (IFRS 5) as explained in Note 4.3. 6.1.3. **SALES OF MERCHANDISE AND EQUIPMENT TO FRANCHISES ###### Merchandise and equipment are sold to Quick franchisees by the Group's subsidiary Logirest France. Revenue from the sale of merchandise and equipment is recognized when their control is transferred to the franchisee, which is the invoice date. ###### Sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees totaled €7.5 million in 2019 vs. €53.0 million in 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to the Group's outsourcing of its purchasing and logistics activities for Quick® restaurants (see Significant events of 2019). ----- 6.1.4. **ENTRY FEES AND OTHER SALES ###### Network entry and franchise entry fees. Network entry and franchise entry fees are charged to franchisees in consideration of the transfer of know-how, the use of the brand, territorial exclusivity and assistance in opening a restaurant. They are invoiced at the start of the contract. As with brand royalties, they are considered to be remuneration for the license to use the trademark and know-how, and not remuneration for distinct services. As this is a ""variable license"" within the meaning of IFRS 15, this income is recognized over the term of the franchise agreement, and on a straight-line basis, since it is considered that the Group's services as a franchisor are provided uniformly over the term of the agreement. Fees invoiced at the start of the contract that have not yet been recognized in ""Sales and franchise income"" are recognized in current and non-current deferred income. Other revenue Other revenue consist mainly of the from services provided to non-Group partners who are not franchisees. Other sales 10 768 8 288 Total 15 874 20 523 ###### Deferred income from network and franchise entry fees is included in ""Other non-current liabilities"" (see Note 6.8) and ""Other current liabilities"" (see Note 6.5.5). It is broken down in the following table: Dec. 2018 In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 restated  8 720 2 390 Non-current deferred income (lease liabilities) Current deferred income (lease liabilities) 10 115 2 390 Total 12 505 11 110 ----- ###### 6.2. Gross and operating profit and margin ###### Cost of sales is the cost of supplies and merchandise and of restaurant personnel. • The cost of supplies and merchandise is the cost of the raw materials and merchandise required to make the finished products sold to consumers (see Note 6.1.1) and the cost of the raw materials, merchandise and equipment the Group sells to franchisees (see Note 6.1.3). • Restaurant personnel costs include salaries, the employer's social security charges, and the benefits paid to Group employees whose work is directly related to the selling of products to consumers (see Note 6.1.1) Occupancy and operating costs mainly include the costs of energy, maintenance, security, leases (until 31 December 2018), and taxes (business tax, property tax, etc.).

The Group closed 13 restaurants in 2019 (vs. 19 in 2018). • Conversion expenses consist mainly of lease payments during the conversion work, personnel expenses and the cost of scrapping Quick's PPE and intangible assets. In 2019, the Group converted 29 restaurants (versus 63 in 2018). Other This line consists mainly of expenses incurred in 2019 to settle the dispute with a former France Quick master franchisee (see Note 9). It also includes the recognition of negative goodwill and of provisions and reversals for contingencies. ----- ###### 6.5. Working capital requirement 6.5.1. **INVENTORIES ###### Inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or net realizable value. ###### The Group's inventories consist of supplies, equipment and food products.

There are no trade receivables that are pledged or insured. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group uses the simplified method to measure trade receivables and recognizes expected credit losses over the life of the receivable. Expected credit losses are estimated using an allowance matrix that is based on historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for specific factors relating to the creditor, current general economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions that are obtainable at the balance sheet date without incurring undue cost or effort.

Prepaid expenses consist mainly of the short-term portion of network entry fees, which are spread over the term of the master franchise agreement. ----- ###### The frozen cash is the France Quick cash attached at the request of a former international master franchisee with whom France Quick had a legal dispute. The change recognized in 2019 reflects the end of this dispute (see Note 9). 6.5.4. **TRADE PAYABLES ###### Trade payables are initially recognized at their fair value, which is generally their nominal value. 6.5.5. **OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES Dec. 2018 In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Change restated  Other tax liabilities 15 122 17 216 (2 094) Employee and social liabilities 24 147 29 713 (5 566) Deferred income 12 981 10 867 2 114 Other 581 506 75 Total 52 831 58 302 (5 471 ) - Other current liabilities have been restated following the reclassifications explained in Note 3.7. ###### Deferred income includes rent received in advance on certain subleases or leases to franchisees and the short-term portion of entry fees spread over the term of the franchise agreement. 6.5.6. **CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ###### The change in the working capital requirement breaks down as follows: In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Effect of change in inventories 6 590 4 415 Effect of change in trade receivables and other current assets 18 653 5 339 Effect of change in trade payables and other liabilities (25 488) (30 022) Total (245 ) (20 268 ) ###### The positive impact of the change in inventories of €2.2 million recognized in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year is mainly attributable to the outsourcing of the Quick purchasing and logistics business in 2019 as described in the ""Significant events of the year"" section. The positive impact of the change in trade receivables of €13.3 million in 2019 vs. 2018 is mainly attributable to: - The release of funds in a France Quick bank account which had been attached at the request of one of its former master franchisees. ----- ###### - The discontinuation of the recognition of trade receivables on sales of merchandise and equipment to franchisees following the Group's outsourcing of the Quick purchasing and logistics activity in 2019, as described in the ""Significant events of the year "" section. - The recovery of VAT receivables recorded at the end of the previous financial year following the legal and real property reorganization undertaken to prepare for the disposal of discontinued operations (see the ""Significant events of the year"" section) The improvement in the impact of the change in trade payables and other current liabilities of €4.5 million is due to: - The decrease in trade payables of the Quick purchasing and logistics business in 2019 following its outsourcing, as described in the ""Significant events of the year"" section - The decrease in trade payables and social security liabilities for restaurants operated directly by the Group, mainly as a result of the franchising of 21 restaurants in 2019 (see Note 6.1.1). 6.6. Non-current financial assets ###### Loans and guarantees pertain mainly to the Group's operating leases as lessee. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost. The Group uses caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives are measured at fair value. The method used to recognize changes in their fair value depends on whether there is a documented hedging relationship as defined in IFRS 9: • in the absence of a hedging relationship, changes in fair value are taken to income • if there is a documented relationship for hedging cash flows, the change in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedging derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income while that of the ineffective portion is directly taken to the income statement. However, the time value of the options is recognized separately as a hedging cost. It is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve within equity. It is recycled to the income statement over the term of the hedge. ###### Non-current financial assets consist of the following: In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Change Loans and guarantees net of impairment Fair value of derivative instruments Other 10 533 4 747 11 186 200 (653) (196) 747 Total 11 284 11 386 (102 ) ###### Other non-current financial assets are the shares in D-Lys Burger acquired on 31 December 2019.

The Group's average full-time equivalent headcount was 3,448 in 2019, vs. 4,620 in 2018. 7.2. Personnel expenses ###### Personnel expenses are recognized as services are provided. Until 31 December 2018, the CICE employment tax credit was recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses and was allocated between the various departments. The 2018 Finance Act abolished the CICE tax credit as of 1 January 2019. At that date, the CICE was replaced by a permanent reduction in employer social security charges. ###### The table below shows personnel expenses recognized in ordinary operating income.

From January 1 to 31 December 2018, all of the income from the CICE tax credit was invested in the opening and conversion of Burger King® restaurants in accordance with the QuickN'King 2020 plan. ----- ###### 7.3. Employee benefits The Group's employees receive short-term benefits (paid leave, sick leave, etc.), post-employment benefits based on defined contributions (social security plans and ARRCO/AGIRC supplementary pension plans) and on defined benefits (lump-sum retirement payments), as well as other long-term benefits (length-of-service and long-service bonuses).

The Group's obligation in respect of this benefit is valued annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Revaluations of the liability (actuarial gains and losses) are recognized in other comprehensive income. The service cost is recognized as an operating expense, in ""general and administrative expenses"", while the associated interest expense is recognized as a financial expense. ###### Main assumptions used for the calculation of defined benefit plans Actuarial assumptions Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Discount rate at 31 December 0.70% 1.60% Salary growth rate 3.00% 3.00% Burger King and Burger King and Quick head-office Quick head-office personnel: 63 yr personnel: 63 yr Retirement age Burger King and Burger King and Quick restaurant Quick restaurant personnel: 62 yr personnel: 62 yr Mortality table INSEE 2012 - 2014 INSEE 2011-2013 ###### The discount rate is based on the yields of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds with maturities equivalent to the term of the liabilities measured. ----- ###### The term of pension plans was 12 years at 31 December 2019.

Share-based compensation ###### The fair value of performance shares granted to employees is recognized in income in ""other non-current expenses"" over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. This fair value was determined using an EBITDA-multiple model, the terms of vesting plans, the market data available at the grant date and the assumptions of the Group’s management. ###### For its RSU plan, implemented in 2018, the Group recognized an expense of €2.7 million in 2019, vs. €0.9 million in 2018. 7.5. Compensation of key management personnel (related parties) In 2019, key executives received compensation of €3.1 million, compared to €3.4 million in 2018. This compensation includes the salaries of these executives, benefits in kind, contributions to defined contribution post-employment benefit plans and the expense of defined benefit post-employment plan. These executives are also entitled to RSU (see Note 7.4). ----- ##### 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PPE ###### 8.1. Goodwill Goodwill is mainly attributable to the following: • in December 2015, the acquisition by Burger King France SAS of 100% of the capital of Financière Quick SAS (€171 million), less the proceeds from the disposal of operations in Belgium and Luxembourg in 2016 (€44 million) • in 2017, the acquisition of BDBK and PINTO (€76 million) • in 2018, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€9 million) • in 2019, the acquisition of seven individually immaterial companies/restaurants (€2 million) and the classification of Quick operations in assets held for sale.

Other intangible assets ###### Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized at cost while those acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition. ###### After their initial recognition, intangible assets are not remeasured. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment (see Note 8.4). Note 8.4). The ""Quick®"" brand The ""Quick®"" brand, which was classified under IFRS 5 at 31 December 2019, is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, in consideration of the fact that it is almost 40 years old and its reputation. There is assumed to be no foreseeable limit to the period during which the brand will generate net cash inflows for the Group. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist mainly of software and patents, licenses and concessions. The amortization of these assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: Number of years Software 3 to 7 Patents, licenses and concessions 5 ###### Leasehold rights (prior to 2019) Until 31 December 2018, intangible assets included the following leasehold interests: • Leasehold interests acquired through business combinations, which are the commercial and construction leasehold interests that Financière Quick acquired when it acquired Quick Restaurants, and which are initially recognized at their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 - ""Business Combinations"". • Leasehold interests acquired separately, i.e. those acquired after Financière Quick's acquisition of Quick Restaurants. All leasehold interests follow the same depreciation rules: • Construction leasehold interests are amortized over the term of the lease (from 30 to 35 years). • Commercial leasehold interests are not amortized. In France, the lessee of a commercial lease is entitled to an almost unlimited number of lease renewals. If the owner wishes to terminate the lease, the lessee is entitled to an eviction indemnity equal to the value of the business at the date of termination. Accordingly, the useful life of the leasehold interest is indefinite as there is no foreseeable limit to the period during which the leasehold interest is expected to generate net cash inflows. As of 1 January 2019, leasehold interests are recorded under rights of use (see Note 8.3.2). ----- ###### 2019 Software and In 000 EUR_ Leasehold Brand Total other rights interest At 31 December 2018 Gross value 88 568 8 545 300 000 397 113 Depreciation, amort. and provisions (9 120) (5 924) (187 000) (202 044) Net value at 31 December 2018 79 448 2 621 113 000 195 069 Impact of first adoption of IFRS 15 Gross value (88 568) - - (88 568) Depreciation, amort. and provisions 9 120 - - 9 120 Net value ( 79 448) - - ( 79 448) At 1 January 2018 Gross value - 8 545 300 000 308 545 Depreciation, amort. and provisions - (5 924) (187 000) (192 924) Net value at 1 January 2019 - 2 621 113 000 115 621 Transactions during the year Acquisitions - 388 - 388 Disposals - (41) - ( 41) Provisions net of reversals - (1 543) - ( 1 543) Business combinations - 46 - 46 Reclassifications and other transactions - 2 314 - 2 314 IFRS 5 reclassification - (18) (113 000) ( 113 018) Total transactions - 1 146 ( 113 000) ( 111 854) At 31 December 2019 Gross value at end of year - 8 823 - 8 823 Depreciation, amort. and provisions at end of year - (5 056) - (5 056) Net value at end of year - 3 767 - 3 767 ###### 2018 Software and In 000 EUR_ Leasehold interest Brand Total other rights At 31 December 2017 Gross value at start of year 105 576 7 347 300 000 412 923 Depreciation, amort. and provisions at start of year (14 448) (4 630) (187 000) (206 078) Net value at start of year 91 128 2 717 113 000 206 845 Transactions during the year Acquisitions 3 821 803 - 4 624 Disposals (9 220) (110) - ( 9 330) Provisions net of reversals 2 294 (2 111) - 183 Business combinations 706 57 - 763 Reclassifications and other transactions (9 281) 1 265 - ( 8 016) Total transactions ( 11 680) ( 96) - ( 11 776) At 31 December 2018 Gross value at end of year 88 568 8 545 300 000 397 113 Depreciation, amort. and provisions at end of year (9 120) (5 924) (187 000) (202 044) Net value at end of year 79 448 2 621 113 000 195 069 ----- ###### An independent external valuation of the Quick® brand, conducted in 2019 on the basis of the financial statements at 31 December 2018, showed that no additional impairment needed to be recognized.

Impairment of intangible assets ###### Whenever warranted by a significant internal or external event or circumstance, the Group performs impairment tests on its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and assets under construction are also tested annually for impairment. The Group performed asset impairment tests at the following two levels: • On each Cash Generating Unit (CGU), which is defined as the smallest group of assets whose cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets. For the Group, each restaurant corresponds to a CGU, whether directly operated or franchised. The net book value of CGUs includes all tangible and intangible assets, except for the brand and goodwill. • At the level of the group of CGUs which comprise the Group as a whole, including goodwill, the brand and all other tangible and intangible assets, since it is at this level that the Group can monitor the synergy gains of business combinations. ###### This impairment test consists of comparing the recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) with its carrying amount, including rights of use. ###### The recoverable amount of an asset (or of a CGU or group of CGUs) is the higher of its value in use or its fair value less the cost of disposal. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of assets. Cash flow projections are based on the Group's five-year business plan restated for the new IFRS 16 standard (lease cancellation) and are extrapolated to infinity at a long-term growth rate. ###### Cash flows are discounted at the WACC based on market assumptions. This rate is calculated using the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and a size premium. It does not include the Group's debt and tax structure. ###### When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value of the asset or group of assets tested, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In the case of a group of assets, the impairment is initially charged to goodwill. ###### If the recoverable amount of an asset other than goodwill rises back above its net book value at a later date the impairment loss recognized on this asset may be reversed. This reversal cannot exceed the impairment loss initially recorded less any depreciation or amortization that would otherwise have been recognized. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed. ----- 8.4.1. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF RESTAURANT CGUS ###### The Group individually tested 278 restaurants that had been in operation for at least 12 months at 31 December 2019. These tests resulted in the following impairment losses for five restaurants in 2019 (vs.19 restaurants in 2018), which were recorded in other non-current operating expenses: Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Impairment Net book value Recoverable value Impairment _In 000 EUR_ Net book value Recoverable value Intangible assets 494 282 (212) 5 697 1 001 (4 696) Property, plant and equipment 5 507 3 090 (2 416) 8 962 3 793 (5 169) Total restaurant CGU & impairment 6 000 3 372 (2 628 ) 14 659 4 794 (9 865 ) ###### The recoverable amount of these CGUs was assessed on the basis of their value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions: In % Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Discount rate 8.10% 8.10% Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00% ###### The following factors were taken into account to determine the discount rate: • the risk-free rate, which is the historical average of the yields of eurozone long-term government bonds; • a market risk premium of 7.5% at 31 December 2019 (vs. 7% at 31 December 2018), which is based on the historical average of equity market returns observed in the eurozone; • the size premium, which is the excess return that is necessary to compensate for the risk associated with the company's size relative to other companies in its market. The size premium used at 31 December 2019 is 2.8% (vs. 3.7% at 31 December 2018). For the CGUs that are not impaired, management has determined that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

There is no indication of impairment in 2019. 8.4.3. **IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF THE GROUP AS A WHOLE ###### The recoverable amount of the Group as a whole was assessed on the basis of its value in use, as determined using various operational assumptions (notably sales and franchise revenue growth and profit margin) and the following DCF assumptions: In % Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Discount rate 8.10% 8.10% Perpetual growth rate used to determine the terminal value 2.00% 2.00% ###### The Group's estimated recoverable amount at 31 December 2019 exceeds its carrying amount by approximately €904 million.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS ###### A provision is recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation at the balance sheet date which is due to a past event that is likely to result in an outflow of resources, the amount of which can be reliably estimated. ###### The provision is the best estimate of the amount that is required to settle the current obligation as of the balance sheet date. ###### 2019 2018 _In 000 EUR_ Commercial, legal and employee dispute risks Employee Total benefits At 31 December 2018 Net value at start of year 6 000 3 098 9 098 Transactions during the year Provisions 1 238 463 1 701 Reversals used (2 680) (195) ( 2 875) Reversals not used (732) - (732) Business combinations 1 49 50 Actuarial gains/(losses) & other transactions (136) 259 123 IFRS 5 reclassification - (139) ( 139) Total transactions ( 2 309) 437 ( 1 872) At 31 December 2019 Net value at end of year 3 691 3 535 7 226 _In 000 EUR_ Commercial, legal and employee dispute risks Employee Other Total benefits provisions At 31 December 2017 Net value at start of year 5 761 3 551 711 10 023 Transactions during the year Provisions 1 156 122          - 1 278 Reversals used (283) (113) (711) ( 1 107) Reversals not used (634)         -         - ( 634) Actuarial gains/(losses) & other transactions          - (462)          - ( 462) Total transactions 239 ( 453) ( 711) ( 925) At 31 December 2018 Net value at end of year 6 000 3 098        - 9 098 ###### Employee benefits are described in Note 7.3. The change in provisions for commercial, legal and employee dispute risks in 2019 is mainly explained by the reversal of the provision recognized in 2016 for a dispute with a former France Quick international master franchisee. In an arbitration decision issued in the second quarter of 2019, the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris found France Quick's decision to terminate its franchise and brand agreements on the grounds of an irremediable ----- ###### breach to be wrongful and ordered France Quick to compensate this former franchisee for its expenses and investments. The provision recognized over the previous years was therefore reversed and the associated expense was recorded under ""Other non-recurring income and expenses"" (see Note 6.4), and the attachment was released (see Note 6.5.3). The other changes concern disputes with employees and tax authorities but not involving income tax. The Group is also involved in several legal proceedings with another of France Quick's former international master franchisee, for which the Group has made no provision as it does not consider this risk to be material. The change in provisions in 2018 was mainly attributable to disputes with employees and tax authorities but not involving income tax. ----- ##### 10. FINANCIAL MATTERS AND INSTRUMENTS ###### 10.1. Net financial income/expense ###### The gross cost of debt consists mainly of interest on bonds, charges on the RCF (non-use commission) and interest on other bank debt. The net cost of debt is the gross cost of debt plus income from cash investments. Until 31 December 2018, it also included interest on finance lease liabilities. Other financial income and expenses consist mainly of: • Interest on lease liabilities • Mandatory refinancing costs • Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments (caps and swaps) • Various bank charges • Interest on post-employment plan liabilities. ###### Interest is calculated using the effective interest rate method. ###### The table below breaks down the Group's net financial income.

(see Note 3.6.4.2). The interest expense on finance leases of €0.2 million was recorded in 2018 as ""Interest on bank debt"". Interest on post-employment plan liabilities was recorded under ""Sundry bank charges and other"" and totaled €49 thousand in 2019, vs. €40 thousand in 2018. 10.2. Financial liabilities, liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests, and lease liabilities ###### Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Non-current financial liabilities consist mainly of bond liabilities, which are recorded net of refinancing costs due in more than year, and bank debt due in more than one year. Current financial liabilities consist of bank debt that is due over the next twelve months, the portion of bond refinancing costs due within one year, bank overdrafts and accrued interest on loans. Lease liabilities are recognized as indicated in Note 3.6. ###### Financial liabilities, liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests, and lease liabilities are shown in the table below: 2019 Cash flow Non-monetary changes In 000 EUR_ 1 Jan. 2019 Inflows from liabilities new Interest paid Repaymentof debt expense interest Unpaid impact on IFRS 16 leases Change in   scope IFRS 5 reclass transactions Reclass & other Dec. 2019 NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Bond issues 613 611  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 2 587 616 198 Bank loans 13 715 15 250  - (4 429)  -  - 5 554  - (761) 29 329 Derivatives 127  -  -  -  -  -  -  - (87) 40 Other financial liabilities of more than 1 year 2 500  -  - (850)  -  -  -  -  - 1 650 Total financial liabilities 629 953 15 250 - (5 279) - - 5 554 - 1 739 647 217 Minority interest purchase commitment liabilities 19 939  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 3 571 23 510 Lease liabilities 326 458  -  -  -  - 114 296  - (46 146) (81 688) 312 920 Total non-current liabilities 976 350 15 250 - (5 279) - 114 296 5 554 (46 146 ) (76 378 ) 983 647 CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Bonds and accrued interest 3 427 - (5 861) - 5 576 - - - 43 3 185 Bank loans and accrued interest 3 246 3 000 (26) (3 399) 8  - 585  - 654 4 068 Bank overdrafts 617 1 101  -  -  -  - 8 (5) (20) 1 701 Other financial liabilities maturing during the year 2 190  - (141) (253) 132  -  -  - (76) 1 852 Total financial liabilities 9 480 4 101 (6 028 ) (3 652 ) 5 716  - 593 (5) 601 10 806 Lease liabilities 51 833  -  - (48 624)  - (33 140)  - (8 042) 81 447 43 474 Total current financial liabilities 61 313 4 101 (6 028 ) (52 276 ) 5 716 (33 140 ) 593 (8 047 ) 82 048 54 280 Total financial liabilities 1 037 663 19 351 (6 028 ) (57 555 ) 5 716 81 156 6 147 (54 193 ) 5 670 1 037 927 ###### Liabilities on commitments to purchase minority interests are described in Note 10.2.3. |2019|Col2|Col3|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |1 Jan.

Until 31 December 2018, it also included finance lease liabilities, which as of 1 January 2019 are recorded under lease liabilities. ###### The Group's gross debt consists of the following: Dec. 2018 In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 restated  Fixed-rate tranche 311 698 310 500 Floating-rate tranche 307 685 306 538 Total bond debt 619 383 617 038 Fixed-rate bank debt 13 623 12 182 Variable-rate bank debt 19 774 4 779 Total bank loans 33 397 16 961 Derivatives 40 127 BPI France - ""Growth loan"" 2 517 3 523 Other 985 1 167 Total other financial liabilities 3 502 4 690 Bank overdrafts 1 701 617 Finance lease liabilities             - 3 840 Total 658 023 643 273 - In the 2018 statement of financial position, derivatives were recorded under ""other non-current liabilities"". ###### All debts were contracted in euros. Bank loans In 2019, the Group set up new bilateral credit lines on Agaquick, Burger King Restauration and France Quick, for €4.5 million, €3 million and €10.6 million respectively The purpose of these credit lines is to finance restaurant conversion and opening investments. ----- ###### Bond issues The table below shows the key characteristics of the Group's bond issues: In 000 EUR_ Carrying amount Nominal Maturity Repayment Rate date High-yield bond 315 000 100 and multiple of 1 01//05/2024 in fine 6% Fixed-rate tranche above this amount High-yield bond 310 000 100 and multiple of 1 01//05/2023 in fine Euribor +5.25% Floating-rate tranche above this amount ###### Burger King France's €625 million bond issue of 21 April 2017, which was completed on 19 December 2017, is composed of the following two tranches: • A fixed-rate €315 million tranche, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on 1 May 2024 and paying 6% interest (semi-annual) • A floating-rate tranche of €310 million, senior secured with a nominal value of €100,000 and a multiple of 1000 above €100,000, maturing on 1 May 2023 and paying Euribor +5.25% (quarterly). This tranche was issued in two phases: initially on 21 April 2017 for €250 million, with proceeds of 99.5% and the balance recognized as an issuance discount, and subsequently on 19 December 2017 for €60 million, with proceeds of 101.75% and the balance recognized as an issuance premium. Burger King France may call some or all of these bonds. The €16.9 million in bond issuance costs are spread over the term of the bond. They were €11.4 million at 31 December 2019, vs. €13.8 million at 31 December 2018. This change is explained by the spreading out of bond issuance costs in 2019.

The current margin is Euribor +2.5%, with a 0% floor. ----- ###### As of 31 December 2019, this RCF has never been used.  If over 35% of the RCF is used, the Group's quarterly leverage ratio (EBITDA / net debt) must not exceed 7.5. This ratio has never been exceeded since this RCF was set up. 10.2.2. **CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ###### Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short- term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are exposed to an insignificant risk of loss. In the cash flow statement, this item is composed of cash and cash equivalents, less bank overdrafts.

The difference between the liability thus recorded and the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. After its initial recognition, the liability is carried at amortised cost and subsequent changes are recognized in equity. In the consolidated income statement, a share of the net income of the Agaquick sub-group is allocated to the non-controlling interests that are still entitled to a share of the subsidiary's earnings. ###### The Group has granted Picpain a put option on its interest in Agaquick. The exercise price of this option was calculated using a contractually predetermined formula. The option may be exercised in 2027. Since the non-controlling interests are still entitled to their share of Agaquick's earnings, the Group has opted for a ""mixed"" accounting treatment of this commitment. 1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non- controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement. The Group also has an option to purchase all of the shares that Picpain holds in Agaquick, which it may exercise pursuant to the shareholders' agreement in 2039, or in the event of a change in the ownership structure of Picpain's Agaquick shares, or in the event of a legal dispute for which Picpain is held liable. ----- ###### 10.3. Classification and fair value of financial instruments ###### The fair value hierarchy levels are: ###### • Level 1: fair value based on prices quoted in an active market • Level 2: fair value measured using observable market data (other than the prices included in Level 1) • Level 3: fair value determined using valuation techniques based on unobservable market data. 2019",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Note 2: the difference between the net book value and the fair value of loans and guarantees is considered immaterial. Note 3: As allowed under IFRS, the fair value of the lease liability and its level in the fair-value hierarchy is not provided. The fair value of other financial instruments was determined as follows: • High-yield bonds and variable-rate loans: their fair value is considered to be near their carrying amount, as the impact of a change in the Group's credit spread is considered immaterial • Other fixed-rate financial debts and minority buy-out commitment debts: the fair value of each debt is determined by discounting future cash flows at the closing market rate, which is adjusted to account for the Group's credit risk. • Standard valuation models were used to estimate the fair value of derivatives. ----- ###### 10.4. Risk management 10.4.1. **GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY ###### The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate and currency risks. The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its floating-rate debt. To manage this risk the Group uses caps or swaps with first-class counterparties. Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies. The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health. 10.4.2. **INTEREST RATE RISK ###### The Group uses caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate bond debt. These derivatives are qualified as cash flow hedging instruments. Hedging is considered to be effective if the Euribor fixing on the hedged loan is strictly equivalent to the fixing of the hedging instrument.

The Group uses derivatives to hedge the currency risk on these foreign currency purchases. Hedging is carried out using either forward exchange contracts or currency options. Each hedging transaction must be approved in advance by the Group's senior management. There were no currency hedging commitments at 31 December 2018 or 31 December 2019. Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk at 31 December 2019, the US dollar's volatility over the year did not have a material impact on income (as in 2018). 10.4.4. **CREDIT RISK ###### Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group. Deposits and guarantees The credit risk on deposits and guarantees is considered to be limited. Cash and cash equivalents With regard to cash and cash equivalents, the credit risk is considered to be limited insofar as: • they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day-to- day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles. • they are invested exclusively in money market instruments. Trade receivables Trade receivables are the amounts owed by franchisees. They may be impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. Indicators of incurred losses include, for example, significant financial difficulties of a franchisee or a breach of the franchise agreement (e.g. payment is past due more than x days). These receivables deemed to be at risk are fully impaired if there are indicators of incurred credit loss. The provision for such losses totaled €3.3 million at 31 December 2019, vs. €4.1 million at 31 December 2018. A statistics-based provision is made for receivables that are not impaired on the basis of incurred credit losses. This statistical provision is based on the history of credit losses actually incurred over the pas ten years. At 31 December 2019, this provision was €78 thousand, vs. €69 thousand at 31 December 2018. Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables. ----- 10.4.5. **LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE ###### The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity. The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short-term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities.

INCOME TAX ###### 11.1. Income tax expense ###### Income tax includes current and deferred taxes and the impact of changes in tax rates. Income taxes are recognized in income (except when recorded in other comprehensive income), directly in equity or during business combinations. After examining the applicable legislation, the Group considers that the CVAE ""business added-value tax"" is an income tax as defined under IAS 12.2 (""Income Tax Payable on Taxable Profits""). The CICE tax credit is treated as an operating subsidy and recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses. ###### Breakdown of income tax expense Dec. 2018 In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 restated  Current tax (2 166) (2 986) Deferred tax 1 624 980 Income tax (542 ) (2 006 ) - The 2018 income statement has been restated in view of the planned sale of Quick's operations, which were classified as discontinued operations under IFRS 5, as explained in Note 4.3. ###### Income tax breakdown The table below shows the difference between the standard Frenc corporate tax rate and the rate effectively paid. Dec. 2018 In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 restated  Net income before tax 5 029 (12 943) Standard tax rate 34,43% 34,43% Theoretical income tax expense (1 731 ) 4 456 _Adjustments to determine the effective tax rate_ - CICE employment tax credit      - 1 903 - Effect of change in tax rate (237) (1 825) - Other tax effects on permanent differences (1) (1 582) (2 785) - Reclassification of the CVAE tax as ordinary income tax (2 372) (3 289) - Unrecognized tax losses and unrecognized use of prior-year 4 869                                        tax losses - Other differences 352 (466) - Difference between company and consolidated tax rates 159 ----- ###### (1) The other tax effects on permanent differences mainly pertain to non-deductible financial expenses, the RSU plan expenses, and the reversal of negative goodwill through income. 11.2. Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, on the basis of the tax rates (and tax regulations) that were adopted or substantially adopted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognized if the temporary difference is likely to reverse in the foreseeable future and there is likely to be a taxable profit to which the temporary difference may be applied. Deferred tax liabilities on interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not recognized unless the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference cannot be controlled and the temporary difference is likely to reverse in the foreseeable future. ###### The table below shows deferred taxes by type and before any offsetting. In 000 EUR_ Dec. 2019 Dec. 2018 Deferred tax assets on loss carry-forwards 8 202 6 503 Spreading forward of entry fees (IFRS 15) 2 597 2 463 Spreading forward of bond issuance expenses (3 909) (4 743) Temporary differences 1 631 1 317 Fixed assets (harmonization of dep./amort. periods, valuation (18 221) (11 095) adjustments, etc.) Provisions for employee benefits 1 194 1 096 Other provisions (383) (1 237) Restatement of finance leases 3 027        Effect of change in tax rate 1 212 751 Other 364 647 TOTAL DEFERRED TAXES (4 286 ) (4 298 ) ###### Deferred tax assets were not recognized since it is unlikely that the Group will have future taxable profits against which these tax assets can be applied. At 31 December 2019, the amount of these unrecognized deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards totaled €84.6 million, vs. €91.2 million at 31 December 2018. Tax losses for which no deferred tax has been recognized can be carried forward indefinitely. ----- ##### 12. EQUITY ###### Share capital ###### Preference shares are classified as equity because they pay discretionary dividends, are subject to no redemption obligation in cash or a financial asset, and do not require settlement in a variable number of the Group's equity instruments.  Discretionary dividend distributions are charged directly to equity when approved by a general assembly of shareholders. ###### Share capital totaled €39,162 thousand at 31 December 2019, vs. €40,012 thousand at 31 December 2018, for a decrease of €850 thousand. This capital reduction, which did not serve to absorb a loss, was effected by purchasing and cancelling 17 Class B preference shares. This decision was approved by the Chairman on 10 December 2019. Although this decision modified the distribution of share capital, it did not affect its amount. At 31 December 2019, Burger King France's share capital consisted of: • 587,478 ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 (vs. 5,836 shares with a value of €1 at 31 December 2018) • 566,700 Class A preference shares with a par value of €0.01 (vs. 5,667 shares with a par value of €1 at 31 December 2018) • 783 Class B preference shares with a par value of €50 thousand (vs. 8 shares with a par value of €5 million at 31 December 2018). Share premium The share premium totaled €163.3 million at 31 December 2019, as in 2018. Dividends Burger King France paid a dividend of €7.19 million in 2019, vs. no dividend in 2018. ----- ##### 13. TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER RELATED PARTIES ###### The related parties are: • parent companies • subsidiaries (see Note 4.4) • joint ventures (see Note 4.6) • key management staff (see Note 7.5). ###### Transactions with parent companies involve the following services: - a service agreement signed with TOPCO - a cash pooling and management agreement between Burger King France and BH SAS - a business development agreement between Burger King France and BH SAS for 2019. - property leases with companies related to BH SAS, - construction leases with companies related to BH SAS. ##### 14.

THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESS ###### Burger King France S.A.S. is a French simplified joint-stock company (SAS). It has its registered office at 50, avenue du Président Wilson 93200, in the city of Saint Denis and is registered in the Paris trade register under No. 797 882 867. The Group develops and perfects a fast-food restaurant concept that is based predominantly on hamburgers and employs various techniques, knowledge and know-how that are appropriate for this type of restaurant. The Group is composed of the following three strategic divisions[1]: - Franchise, which consists of the restaurants operated by franchisees - Company-owned, which consists in the restaurants the Group operates - Other business activities, which consist mainly of logistics, marketing, advertising and head- office management activities. The consolidated financial statements present the accounting situation of Burger King France S.A.S and its subsidiaries (together the ""Group"") and the interest held in a joint venture. They are presented in euros, with figures rounded off to the nearest thousand. The Group's financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 were approved by the Chairman on 13 March 2019 and will be proposed for approval at the forthcoming annual shareholders meeting. ##### 2. A SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ACCOUNTING METHODS ###### 2.1. General accounting policies The consolidated financial statements of the Burger King France Group for 2018 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted mandatorily in the European Union at 31 December 2018, and with SIC and IFRIC interpretations thereof. 1 In accordance with IFRS 8 ""Operating Segments"", the information provided by operating segment is derived from the internal organization of Burger King Group's business activities. It reflects the perspective of the Group’s management and is based on internal reports that are used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. ###### 2018 consolidated financial statements – GROUPE BURGER KING FRANCE ----- ###### All of the relevant rules adopted by the European Union are available on the European Commission's website at https//www.euronext.com.//ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standards-regulation-ecno-1606- 2002/amending-and-supplementary-acts/acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutinyrps_en#individual- rps-acts-adopting-international-accounting-standards-ifrsias-and-related-interpretations-ifric. ###### In preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group has observed the same accounting standards, interpretations and policies observed for the year ended 31 December 2017, or, where applicable, the new standards which came into effect on 1 January 2018. 2.2. Changes in the accounting framework Standards, amendments and interpretations which must be observed as of 1 January 2018 The main IFRS standards, amendments and interpretations which became mandatory in the European Union on 1 January 2018 are: - IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers (see Note 2.7 below) - IFRS 9 – Financial instruments (see Note 2.7 below) - The amendments to IFRS 2 “Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions” - IFRIC 22 “Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration” - Amendments to IAS 28 ""Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures"" - IFRS annual improvements– 2014 - 2016 cycle. Apart from IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 (the impacts of which are explained in note 2.7), the other standards had no impact on the Group's accounts. Standards, amendments and interpretations which will become mandatory as of 1 January 2019 The following standards, amendments and interpretations must be observed as of 1 January 2019: - IFRS 16 – Leases This new standard will replace IAS 17 and the associated IFRIC and SIC interpretations on 1 January 2019 and will eliminate, for lessees, the distinction between ""operating leases"" and ""finance leases"". 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### Lessees will be required to account for all leases with a term of more than one year in accordance with the method currently used for finance leases under IAS 17, and thus recognize leasehold interests and obligations respectively as assets and liabilities. The impact of the application of this standard on the financial statements is being determined. The cumulative catch-up method will be used during the transitional period. The Group has undertaken an inventory of its leases and their main clauses. The main impacts expected have to do with the restatement of finance leases. The magnitude of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 can be assessed on the basis of the amount of operating lease commitments (see note 27). However, given the changes in standards and the Group's assumptions, lease commitments may not be fully representative of the lease liability that will be recognized under IFRS 16. - Amendments to IFRS 9 ""Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation"" - IFRIC Interpretation 23 on “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”. Lastly, the following IASB standards and interpretations were not yet adopted by the European Union as of 31/12/2018 but are likely to apply to the Group: - Amendments to IAS 19 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement - IFRS annual improvements – 2015-2017 cycle - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Materiality 2.3. Use of estimates and judgments In preparing its financial statements, the management of Burger King France Group must make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and also the information provided in the notes to the financial statements. The Group's management makes these estimates and assessments on an ongoing basis, based on past experience and various factors it considers to be reasonable. Unexpected changes in events and circumstances, particularly within the Group's business environment, may cause actual results to differ from these estimates. The most material estimates made by the Group's management concern intangible assets (mainly the brand and leasehold interests), provisions and asset impairment tests. Information on the critical judgments made with regard to IAS 17 “Leases” is provided in note 8.7. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### 2.4. Consolidation methods The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Burger King France SAS and its subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Group's main subsidiaries and joint ventures are listed in Note 4 ""Scope of consolidation"". Consolidation of subsidiaries A subsidiary is a company which the Group controls. The Group controls a company when it is exposed to, or is entitled to, variable returns from its relationship with the company and may have an impact on these returns through its control over the company. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date that such control is initially obtained and until it ceases. Equity method of accounting for joint ventures A joint venture is a form of partnership that gives the Group joint control over a company and rights to the net assets of the joint venture, but no rights to its assets or obligations in respect of its liabilities. Burger King France accounts its joint ventures using the equity method. 2.5. Foreign currency translation methods The Group's presents its accounts in euros, which is its functional currency. Foreign currency transactions Transactions carried out in a foreign currency by the various Group entities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the prevailing exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation differences are recognized in the income statement. 2.6. Measurement bases The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, with the exception of certain types of assets and liabilities for which IFRS standards are observed. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### 2.7. Effects of the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 As of 1 January 2018, the Group has observed IFRS 15 ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and IFRS 9 ""Financial Instruments"". IFRS 15 ""REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS"" This new standard deals with the recognition of revenue and replaces existing requirements and in particular those of IAS 11 and IAS 18. Burger King France will observe the cumulative catch-up method during the transition to this new standard. Information relating to the 2017 financial year is presented in accordance with the former IAS 18 standard. Transition adjustments totaling - €3,216 thousand were recognized in equity on 1 January 2018. To determine this standard's impact on its financial statements, the Group has reviewed the most significant customer contracts in its various business segments. It has thus determined that the application of the new standard impacts the timing of the recognition of revenue from franchise entry fees, which entitle franchisees to use the Group's intellectual property. Accordingly, revenue and expenses related to franchise entry fees are now recognized over the term of the agreement. This has resulted in the recognition of €1,472 thousand in ""Other income"" on the income statement. The table below shows the impacts on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018, which includes a €3,216 thousand adjustment on opening equity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

IFRS 9 – Financial instruments IFRS 9 has been observed as of 1 January 2018 using the limited retrospective method, with no adjustment of comparative amounts. This new standard replaces IAS 39, which was observed until 31 December 2017. On this date, the first application of IFRS 9 resulted in the reclassification of cap hedging items from consolidated reserves to cash flow hedging reserves. This reclassification amounted to €854 thousand. The other provisions of IFRS 9 had no impact on the amount of consolidated equity at 1 January 2018. The Group's analyses and conclusions are presented below for each phase the reclassification. Phase I - Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities The Group has reviewed its financial assets in accordance with the new IFRS 9 classification, which is based on the company's business model and the contractual characteristics of the financial assets. The Group's financial assets consist mainly of loans, receivables and deposits and have therefore not been affected by the change and continue to be measured using the amortized cost method. All financial assets are always presented on the line ""Financial assets"" and are described in Note 18 of these notes: ""Financial receivables and other non-current assets"". Phase 2 - Financial asset impairment The Group's analysis focused mainly on the impairment of trade receivables, as the Group has no significant non-group loans and no significant financial receivables. The Group has opted to use the simplified method to measure the impairment of its trade receivables. A review of the historical loss experience of these receivables did not reveal any material amount and no adjustment for this was made to the Group's opening equity. Phase 3 - Hedge Accounting The Group's analysis did not reveal any renegotiation of financing that required restatement. The changes to the method used to account for the Group's hedging instruments reduced shareholders' equity by €854 thousand. This impact is explained by the change in the accounting treatment of the time value of options, with interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The reclassification of financial instruments pursuant to the IFRS 9 categories had no overall impact on the measurement bases of financial assets and liabilities. The accounting rules and methods the Group has observed in applying IFRS 15 are described in Notes 3.18 ""Financial assets"", 3.19 ""Financial liabilities"" and 3.20 ""Derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions"". 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ##### 3. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS ###### 2018 was marked by the following significant events. System-wide sales At 31 December 2018, system-wide sales totaled €1,216 million. This is €109 million more than at 31 December 2017 and represents 9.9% growth. The growth is attributable to: - the positive impact of the ongoing conversion of restaurants to the Burger King® brand in France, - the good performance of Quick on a comparable restaurant basis. Profitability Thanks to an €109 million increase in system-wide sales compared to 31 December 2017, the Group increased: - its profitability, with EBITDA of €111.5 million, representing 27.6% annual growth - the ratio of EBITDA over Sales and Franchise income to 17.7%, vs.14.7% at 31 December 2017. This good performance was mainly due to the ongoing development of the Burger King® brand in France throughout 2018. Business development To consolidate its network, the Group had invested €93 million at 31 December 2018, mainly in restaurant openings and conversions. Financing and acquisition In 2018, the Group paid the €15.9 million balance of its 2017 acquisition of BDBK. On February 26, 2018, Burger King Restauration (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Burger King France) acquired majority stakes in three new companies: Flagship Restauration (50.71%), BK Expansion (84.44%) and BK Développement (73.12%). These companies operate four restaurants under the Burger King® brand. During the year, the Group also: - set up new bilateral credit lines, mainly for Agaquick and BK expansion, for respectively €4,500 thousand and €950 thousand. These credit lines will serve to finance conversion investments. - repaid in advance Burger King France's 2016 CICE pre-financing debt of €4,133 thousand to BPI France and factored without recourse its 2016, 2017 and 2018 CICE receivable to a bank for approximately €13,700 thousand. - factored without recourse BDBK's 2017 CICE receivable to a factor for approximately €1,100 thousand. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### Litigation Following a new decision by the enforcement judge of the Bobigny Tribunal de Grande Instance concerning the dispute with our former Turkish franchisee, the amount of €5.5 million was frozen in France Quick's bank accounts on March 5, 2018 as a protective measure. France Quick has contested this. The procedure to contest this attachment of assets is still ongoing as of the date of publication of our consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018 and no conclusions may be drawn as to the merits of the judge's decision. All long-term provisions are detailed in Note 8.13. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ##### 4.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL ###### Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities that meet the IFRS recognition criteria are generally recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any interest previously held in the acquiree) plus the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognized (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Non-controlling interests are measured when control is gained, either pro rata to the identifiable net assets or at fair value, depending on the option selected. When the difference thus determined is negative, and after the various components are remeasured, it can be immediately taken to income. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment loss. In accordance with IAS 36, impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement and are irreversible. An increase in the interest held in a subsidiary or a decrease that does not result in a loss of control is not a business combination but a transaction with non-controlling interests that is recognized directly in equity. ##### 6. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCOUNTED OPERATIONS ###### A non-current asset or a group of associated assets and liabilities is considered to be held for sale in the following cases, in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”:  the asset or group is available for immediate sale in its present condition  its sale is highly likely, which is the case when management has undertaken efforts to sell the asset or group and to find a buyer at a reasonable price and has committed to sell it within one year. Non-current assets, groups of assets or businesses held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value (i.e. the estimated selling price), net of disposal costs. They are presented on a separate line on the balance sheet and are no longer depreciated or amortized. Only complete discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### The Group disposed of no business activity during the year. ##### 7. NOTES TO THE INCOME STATEMENT ###### 7.1. Operating revenue Operating revenue is presented on the income statement line item ""Sales and franchise income"" and consists mainly of: - The sales of company-operated restaurants, which are recognized at their net-of-tax amount at the time of purchase in the restaurant. - Income from franchisees:  the royalties received from franchisees for the use of the Burger King® and Quick® brands.  property and business lease income, less payment waivers (calculated as a percentage of sales and charged to franchisees for the occupancy of the premises and the leasehold interests).  Franchisee contributions to national advertising expenditures.  The income of subsidiary Logirest France from the sale of merchandise and equipment to Quick franchisees. The various types of franchise agreements are: full franchise, shared franchise, business lease, and business lease with investment. The percentage paid depends on the type of agreement. With the exception of Logirest income, operating revenue is recognized when the franchisees recognize sales. Logirest income is recognized when the control of merchandise and equipment is transferred to the franchisee.

Income tax Corporate income tax includes current and deferred taxes and the impact of changes in tax rates. It is recognized on the income statement, except when associated with items that are recognized directly in equity or through other comprehensive income, in which case it is also recognized outside of profit and loss. Current tax consists of the tax payable on the year’s taxable income calculated at the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and of prior-period adjustments. After examining the applicable legislation, the Group considers that the CVAE ""business added-value tax"" is an income tax as defined under IAS 12.2 (""Income Tax Payable on Taxable Profits""). The CICE tax credit is treated as an operating subsidy and recorded as a reduction in personnel expenses. The CICE tax credit receivable that is ""anticipated"", i.e. calculated during the year of payment of the remuneration on which it is based and before the payment of tax in 2018, was factored to a credit institution.

This conversion plan began in mid-2016 and will be completed by mid-2020. The net value of the Quick brand was maintained at €113 million at 31 December 2018. An impairment test of Quick royalties revealed no impairment at 30 December 2018. Research and development Research expenditures in view of acquiring new scientific or technical knowledge are expensed when incurred. Development expenditures in view of applying research findings to a plan or concept in order to make new or significantly improved products and processes are capitalized if all of the recognition requirements of IAS 38 - ""Intangible Assets"" are met. Leasehold interests  Leasehold interests acquired through business combinations are the commercial and construction leasehold interests that Financière Quick acquired when it acquired Quick Restaurants, and which are initially recognized at their fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 - ""Business Combinations"". They are subject to the same amortization rules as leasehold interests acquired separately.  Leasehold interests acquired separately are those acquired after Financière Quick's acquisition of Quick Restaurants. In France, construction leasehold interests are amortized over the term of the lease (from 30 to 35 years) and are classified as intangible assets with a finite useful life. Commercial leasehold interests are not amortized and are classified as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In France, the lessee of a commercial lease is entitled to an almost unlimited number of lease renewals. If the owner wishes to terminate the lease, the lessee is entitled to an eviction indemnity equal to the value of the business at the date of termination. Accordingly, the useful life of the leasehold interest is indefinite as there is no foreseeable limit to the period during which the leasehold interest is expected to generate net cash inflows. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### The value in use of non-amortized leasehold interests is allocated to the restaurant CGU and is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Asset impairment Whenever warranted by a significant internal or external event or circumstance, the Group performs impairment tests on its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and assets under construction are also tested annually for impairment. These impairment tests consist in comparing the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit (CGU), with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less the cost of disposal. A CGU is defined as the smallest group of assets whose cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of an asset or a CGU. In accordance with IAS 36, the Group discounts future cash flows using a WACC rate that is based on market assumptions. This rate is calculated using the risk-free interest rate[2], the market risk premium [3] and a size premium[4]. It does not include the Group's debt and tax structure. When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value of the asset or group of assets tested, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In the case of a group of assets, the impairment is initially charged to goodwill. 2 the risk-free rate used is based on the historical average of the yields of eurozone long-term government bonds. 3 The market risk premium used is 7%. It is based on a historical average of equity market returns observed in the eurozone. 4 The size premium is the excess return that is necessary to compensate for the risk associated with the company's size relative to other companies in its market. The size premium used is 3.7%. ###### 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### If the recoverable amount of an asset other than goodwill rises back above its net book value at a later date the impairment loss recognized on this asset may be reversed. This reversal cannot exceed the impairment loss initially recorded less any depreciation or amortization that would otherwise have been recognized. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed. The Group performed asset impairment tests at the following three levels: • the CGUs identified at the Burger King France Group level as a restaurant, whether operated by the Group or by a franchisee. The recoverable amount of a CGU is its future after-tax cash flows discounted over 5 years plus a terminal value. • The brand, using the method described in section 3.13. • The Group level, i.e. all of the Group’s fixed assets including goodwill, the brand, all other intangible assets and PPE. The impairment testing of the above assets compares their balance sheet value with their discounted after-tax future cash flows over 5 years plus a terminal value. These three types of tests constitute the various steps of the impairment testing process.

Deferred taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities must be measured at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the year when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on the tax rates (and tax regulations) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognized if the temporary difference is likely to reverse in the foreseeable future and there is likely to be a taxable profit to which the temporary difference may be applied. Deferred tax liabilities on interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures are recognized unless the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference cannot be controlled and the temporary difference is not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Group has presented the amount of the ""minority put"" directly on the consolidated balance sheet. The Group has treated this put option as a transaction between shareholders. The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity.

Leases Leases are classified as finance leases if substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group. Leases under which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. As a lessee Recognition of finance leases Finance leases are initially recognized as assets and liabilities at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease if this can be determined. Otherwise the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. The direct costs initially incurred by the lessee are added to the recognition amount of the asset. After the initial recognition, the minimum lease payments are allocated between the finance charge and the amortization of the remaining liability. The finance charge must be allocated to each period of the lease so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### each period. Leased assets are also depreciated using a method that is consistent with the method the Group's normally uses to depreciate its assets.

Income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another method is more representative of the time pattern of the decline in the benefit derived from the use of the leased asset. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and are expensed over the term of the lease on the same basis as lease income. The method used to depreciate leased depreciable assets is consistent with the method the lessor normally uses to depreciate similar assets. As lessor, Burger King Group France considers business leases, business leases with investments and real property leases to be operating leases. The term of business leases is 9+9 years for Burger King® restaurants, and from 3 to 12 years for Quick restaurants. Shared franchise agreements for Quick have a term of nine years.

The Group's inventories consist of supplies, equipment and food products. They are recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price plus customs duties, other non-recoverable taxes, and the costs of transportation and handling incurred in bringing inventory items to their storage site. Equipment inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method. The food products inventory is valued using the FIFO method (First in, First Out) given the rapid turnover of this inventory and the rules that apply to its management. 8.9.

There are no trade receivables that are pledged or insured. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group uses the simplified method to measure trade receivables and recognizes expected credit losses over the life of the receivable. Expected credit losses are estimated using an allowance matrix that is based on historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for specific factors relating to the creditor, current general economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions that are obtainable at the balance sheet date without incurring undue cost or effort. The expected credit losses measured using the simplified approach totaled €72 thousand for 2018. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### 8.10.

Pursuant to this standard, share subscription and purchase options and performance shares granted to employees are measured at their fair value, which must be recognized in income over the vesting period with corresponding increases in equity. The latter amounted to €899 thousand in 2018. The valuation models used to determine this fair value of options and rights are based on the terms of the vesting plan, the market data available at the grant date and the assumptions of the Group’s management. The Group implemented an RSU plan in 2018. Non-controlling interests The non-controlling interests are: - The sub-group consisting of Agaquick SAS and its subsidiaries[5], in which the Group has a 50% stake - BK Expansion, BK Development and Flagship. 5 The Group has agreed to sell its stake in Agaquick via a put option. Burger King France considers this put option to be a transaction between shareholders and has observed the following mixed accounting treatment: 1) The put liability was recognized against the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests and the difference between the liability recorded for the purchase commitment and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests is deducted from the Group's share of equity. 2) A share of Agaquick's net income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement. ###### 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### The table below shows the key financial figures of these non-controlling interests taken from their consolidated financial statements.

""Litigation"" consists in particular of a provision of €2.5 million for an ongoing dispute with our former franchisee in Turkey, which was provisioned in 2016. At the end of November 2015, France Quick terminated its franchise and Quick brand usage contracts with its franchisee when it was brought to its attention that the franchisee had registered a number of trademarks containing the name ""Quick"" in violation of the contractual provisions. At the end of January 2016, the franchisee filed an arbitration claim against France Quick with the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. The former franchisee: - challenges the grounds for terminating the franchise and brand usage contracts - claims damages. The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is expected to render its decision in the first half of 2019. The group's legal advisors and management dispute the validity of the franchisee's action and have decided to maintain the €2.5 million provision in their accounts. During the arbitration period (the procedure was completed when our consolidated financial statements for 2018 were published, but the decision had not been rendered), the former franchisee had two attachment orders issued on France Quick's accounts. An attachment of €9.4 million was effected for an initial claim in November 2016 and was recorded under ""Other financial receivables"". A second attachment of €5.5 million was effected in March 2018 for a second claim that was made for a significantly higher amount. France Quick has contested both of these attachments and these two actions are still pending as of the date of publication of our 2018 consolidated financial statements. 8.14. Employee benefits The post-employment benefits granted by the Group in a specific locality depend on legal requirements and the policy observed. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### The Group's employees receive short-term benefits (paid leave, sick leave, etc.) and post-employment benefits under defined contribution plans (lump-sum retirement payments and supplementary pension plans). All Group entities expense short-term benefits the year the expense is incurred. Defined contribution plans Under a defined-contribution plan contributions are regularly paid to an external organization that is responsible for the administration of the plan and the management of its assets. Such plans release the employer from any future obligation, as the external organization assumes responsibility for paying the amounts due to employees under the basic social security pension plan, the ARRCO and AGIRC supplementary pension plans and the employer’s defined-contribution plan. The Group's payments are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.  Lump-sum retirement payments In France, lump-sum retirement payments under wage agreements are the only type of defined-benefit post-employment benefit. The Group’s wage agreement provides for the payment of a lump-sum benefit that is a function of the employees' length of service with the Group and his or her salary at the time of retirement.

Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet under other non-current assets or as current or non-current financial liabilities depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and are measured at their fair value on the date of the transaction. The method used to recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether there is a documented hedging relationship as defined in IFRS 9: - in the absence of a hedging relationship, changes in fair value are taken to income - if there is a documented relationship for hedging cash flows, the change in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedging derivative is initially recorded in other comprehensive income while that of the ineffective portion is directly taken to the income statement. Both of these situations apply to the Burger King Group. The Group uses caps and swaps to hedge its variable-rate financial liabilities. These derivatives enable the Group to hedge its exposure to rising interest rates and consequently its financial expenses. The amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are taken to the income statement symmetrically with the recognition of the hedged items.

Capital management policy The Group's primary objective in managing its capital is to maintain a good credit risk rating and capital ratios, in order to facilitate its business activities and maximize shareholder value. There was no change in its management objectives, policies and procedures in 2018. The Group's financial indicators are described in Note 14. 9.2. Risk management policy The Group's day-to-day business activities are exposed to interest-rate and currency risks. The Group is exposed to the risk that an increase in interest rates may increase its variable-rate debt. To manage this risk the Group uses caps or swaps with first-class counterparties. Foreign exchange risks are immaterial due to the limited volume of import purchases in non-euro currencies and the lack of income in these currencies. The Group has little exposure to credit risk because its income comes mainly from restaurants, where payments are made almost immediately (in cash or by bank card, restaurant voucher, etc.) and from its franchisees, most of whom are in good financial health. 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements – GROUPE BURGER KING ----- ###### 9.3. Interest rate risk The derivatives used are qualified as hedging instruments and are treated as cash-flow hedges on the caps and swaps. Hedging is considered to be effective if the Euribor fixing on the hedged loan is strictly equivalent to the fixing of the hedging instrument.",N/A,as_expected,2021,789

Credit risk Credit risk includes all forms of counterparty default and is closely monitored by the Group. The Group considers that the following financial assets have little exposure to credit risk: Financial receivables and other non-current assets, in particular guarantees on leases arranged with recognized financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents are exposed to very little risk, since:  they are invested with first-class banks or with Bertrand Holding, which ensures that the Group has day-to-day access to funds and is not exposed to capital risk, by selecting appropriate banking partners and investments vehicles.  they are invested exclusively in money market instruments.

Credit risk assessment and the decision to impair a trade receivable are made on a case-by-case basis. Given the large number of customers, there is no risk of concentration of trade receivables. 9.5. Currency risk The Group's exposure to currency risk is very limited as most of its business is conducted in Europe. The main currency exposure is to the USD, subsequent to the purchase of various merchandise in this currency. The Group uses derivatives to hedge the currency risk on these foreign currency purchases. Hedging is carried out using either forward exchange contracts or currency options. Each hedging transaction must be approved in advance by the Group's senior management. There were no currency hedging commitments at 31 December 2018, as was the case at the end of 2017. Given the limited exposure to foreign exchange risk at 31 December 2018, the US dollar's volatility over the year did not have a material impact on income. 9.6. Liquidity risk and outstanding debt The prepayment of the Group's financial liabilities is only required when there is a contractual change in the control of a group entity. Management believes that the Group is not subject to liquidity risk at 31 December 2018. The Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. There is limited short- term liquidity risk as cash assets and credit lines can be quickly mobilized to cover current liabilities.
