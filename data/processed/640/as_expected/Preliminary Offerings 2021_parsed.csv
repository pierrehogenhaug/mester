See “Property Valuation.” In this Offering Memorandum, “operating profit before adjusted items” represents operating profit adjusted for administrative expenses/(income) adjusted items and other operating expenses/(income) adjusted items. Where presented, unaudited consolidated financial information of the Company for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 is a Non-GAAP Measure. We believe that the presentation of Non-GAAP Measures may or could enhance investors understanding of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA-based measures are commonly used by investors. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. For example, our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA include certain adjustments which some companies might not include in the definition of “adjusted EBITDA.” Our Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under UK GAAP, IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction and should not be considered substitutes to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with UK GAAP, IFRS or the accounting measures of any other jurisdiction. Our Non-GAAP Measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under UK GAAP or IFRS. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” under the Indenture. Some limitations of EBITDA-based measures include: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; - although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortised will often have to be replaced in the future, and the Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate Non-GAAP Measures such as adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. Accordingly, you should rely on our UK GAAP and IFRS results and use these Non-GAAP Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance. Key performance indicators and other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are not part of our financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation of these indicators may not be comparable with the use of computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None of the key performance indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum should be considered in isolation or as a substitute to any indicator of our operating performance, cash flows or other measure of performance derived in accordance with UK GAAP or the accounting measures of other jurisdictions. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,Our Business Lines,"Our operations comprise the following six business lines, each of which falls within three broader categories, and as such, we present them throughout this Offering Memorandum in this manner: ----- - rental activities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, comprising Stage and Other Production Accommodation, Media Hub and Television Studios; - ancillary activities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, comprising Post Production and Ancillary Studio Services; and - other activities, primarily consisting of International Sales and Marketing. Rental activities are by far the largest contributor to our business, accounting for 92.6% of Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Rental activities typically include income generated by the use of stages, workshops, offices, and TV studios. Demand for our ancillary activities, accounting for 6.0% of Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, is driven in part by demand for our rental activities. These activities typically include post production services, recharging of utilities, and revenue/profit sharing arrangements with third-party providers. The chart below displays the percentage of our Contribution by business line for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. A brief description of each of our business lines is set forth below. _Rental: Stage and Other Production Accommodation_ Our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line relates to Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. As our core business line, Stage and Other Production Accommodation drives the largest proportion of Contribution. Stage rental relates to the rental of stage space and infrastructure required to produce screen content. The stages are used to house the physical set on which action and sounds are recorded. Our stages come in a variety of sizes and types and are generally soundproofed and heated. Pursuant to the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our existing stage space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios has been contracted by Disney and Netflix, respectively. Other Production Accommodation rental primarily relates to the renting of office space and workshop space where sets are created or stored. Demand for Other Production Accommodation is typically driven by demand for our stages. Pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our existing Other Production Accommodation space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios has been contracted by Disney and Netflix, respectively. See “Business—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term Contract” and “Business—Material _Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.”_ Stage and Other Production Accommodation as a percentage of Contribution has continued to increase with the completion of approximately 205,000 square feet of lettable space at Pinewood East Phase 2, which was completed in autumn 2019 (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately 39,000 square feet, ----- completed in summer 2020), and will increase further by approximately 1.1 million square feet in aggregate upon completion of the five new stages at Pinewood West, Shepperton North West and Shepperton South development projects. Disney has pre-let the five new stages at Pinewood West as part of the Disney Long-term Contract and Netflix has pre-let approximately 60% of the space being developed at the Shepperton South studio. For more information on our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line, see “Business—Our Business _Lines—Rental—Stage and Other Production Accommodation.” Rental: Media Hub_ We lease space on-site to independent companies that support film and television production. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios offer approximately 228,000 square feet of space, to approximately 178 independent businesses as of September 30, 2021. The tenants pay rent directly to us and supply their services to the production companies filming at the studios, as well as to external “off-the-lot” customers. Tenants in our Media Hub benefit from association with our strong brand and proximity to their customer base. Historically, the Media Hub has been a secure source of Contribution. There is significant demand for on-site space, with occupancy rates averaging 95% over the past ten fiscal years to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. For more information, see “Summary—Our Key Strengths—Resilient and Cash Generative Business Model Now _Underpinned by Long-term Contracts.” All turnover generated under the Long-term Contracts is reported under_ Stage and Other Production Accommodation. Accordingly, at the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, certain turnover previously reported under the Media Hub business line moved to Other Production Accommodation with any reallocation of the demises in connection with the Long-term Contracts. For more information on our Media Hub business line, see “Business—Our Business Lines— Rental—Media Hub.” _Rental: Television Studios_ We have three dedicated Television Studios available to hire at Pinewood Studios, one of which is contracted to the National Lottery (Camelot). We have relationships with customers such as the BBC, Endemol Shine UK, Fremantle and Avalon, which contribute to the success of this business line. In addition to earning turnover from Television Studio space, we generate turnover from supplying freelance crew as well as owned and hired television equipment. The Television Studios at Pinewood Studios are excluded from the Disney Long-term Contract and we will continue to manage and hire the Television Studios on a case-by-case basis. For more information on our Television Studios business line, see “Business—Our Business Lines—Rental—Television _Studios.” Ancillary: Ancillary Studio Services_ Ancillary Studio Services comprise additional services utilised by production companies hiring Stage and Other Production Accommodation. The key services we provide in this business line are utilities (for example, we offer electricity, water and gas, which are principally passed through at cost to our long-term contract customers) and other services through revenue or profit-sharing agreements with preferred third-party service providers. For more information on our Ancillary Studio Services business line, see “Business—Our Business _Lines—Ancillary—Ancillary Studio Services.” Ancillary: Post Production_ Post Production provides support to content creators. This business line includes localisation services which offer audio mixing in multiple languages for our customers requiring international re-versioning services. In addition, through this business line we offer our customers mixing theatres, cutting rooms, and production offices available for dry hire at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, all of which are excluded from the Long-term Contracts. For more information, see “Business—Our Business Lines—Ancillary—Post Production.” _Other Activities_ We also generate turnover by providing sales, marketing and brand licensing services and consultancy services relating to studio space to other studios around the world. Historically, we provided these services to studios in Atlanta, Canada, China, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, and Wales. On August 5, 2019, we divested our equity interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, although we continued to provide sales and marketing services until October 14, 2020, and it ceased to be a Pinewood branded studio on December 14, 2020. We separately ceased providing services to studios in Malaysia in July 2019 and in Wales on March 31, 2020. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Our two freehold studios, Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, are set over 502 acres with approximately 2.0 million square feet of space in close proximity to central London, which makes us a preferred choice for major film production companies. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios are valued at a Market Value of £2,158 million pursuant to the Valuation Report. Pinewood-branded studios have hosted over 2,000 films, which have received among them 170 Oscar awards and 230 BAFTA awards and include numerous blockbuster film productions such as 23 out of the 25 James Bond films, 16 out of the 27 Marvel super hero films and 8 out of the 12 Star Wars films. We signed long-term index-linked contracts for 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios with Disney and Netflix, respectively in 2019. Collectively, these Long-term Contracts cover a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet. These contracts are each for an initial term of at least ten years and provide for annual rent increases, subject to floors. Disney utilises Pinewood Studios for its own productions as well as for its affiliated production companies, including Lucasfilm and Marvel. Netflix utilises Shepperton Studios as a production hub to produce original content. The Long-term Contracts simplify our business model, improve the resilience and visibility of our turnover from investment-grade rated tenants, and demonstrate the continued demand for our facilities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. See “Business—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term Contract” and “Business—Material _Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.”_ Demand for purpose-built studio space remains extremely strong. Over the last few years, we have been progressing our expansion plans at our UK studios, Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. Construction is currently underway for five new stages at Pinewood Studios that will provide approximately 100,000 square feet of additional stage space at Pinewood West, which we anticipate opening in 2022. Disney has pre-let these stages pursuant to the Disney Long-term Contract. At Shepperton Studios, we have detailed planning consent to develop an additional approximately 1.0 million square feet of lettable area, adjacent to the existing studio. We intend to develop this expansion in two phases, which we refer to as Shepperton North West and Shepperton South. Construction of both phases is underway and we have entered into fixed price contracts for the works, thereby significantly derisking the execution of these projects. Additionally, we entered into a long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. The lease will commence on completion of the development, expected towards the end of 2023, and is on terms similar to the Netflix Long-term Contract. There is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Contribution from Stage and Other Production Accommodation, together with the specialty stages, accounted for 83.8% of total Contribution. We earned 98.6% of our total Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 in the United Kingdom, with 92.6% representing rental income at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, our two freehold studios.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.1,Resilient and Cash Generative Business Model Underpinned by Long-term Contracts,"As a result of the Long-term Contracts, 100% of the Group’s existing Stage and Other Production Accommodation is under contract for an initial term of at least ten years, providing long-term visibility on future turnover. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Contribution from Stage and Other Production Accommodation, together with the specialty stages, accounted for 83.8% of total Contribution. Rent under the Long-term Contracts is linked to UK RPI, with annual rental rate increases. See “Business—Material Contracts.” Our Long-term Contracts have not been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to entering into the Long-term Contracts, our studios had a long history of consistently operating at what we believe to be our structural maximum occupancy levels under a model of short-term hire agreements. In addition, our Media Hub business line has also demonstrated consistently high occupancy rates historically. For the past ten fiscal years, our Media Hub business line occupancy rates averaged 95%. For more information, see “Business—Our Business Lines—Rental—Media Hub.” We have a proven track record of stable or growing Adjusted EBITDA generation, including during both the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. We also benefit from high Adjusted EBITDA margins. For example, we had an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 64% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 65% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The high Adjusted EBITDA margins are attributable to our business model focused on providing infrastructure related offerings. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin tends to increase as we expand the space at our existing studios while leveraging on our existing central and operative functions. In addition, our results benefit from having ceased a number of low margin or loss-making activities. See “— _Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Statistical, As Adjusted and Other Financial Data.”_ (1) Joint ventures were proportionally consolidated in accordance with UK GAAP until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013; from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method in accordance with IFRS. Our year-end was December 31 until 2010. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 was based on interim results for twelve-month period ended Dec 31, 2011. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 reflects a twelve-month fiscal year ending on March 31, 2013. In 2021 we entered into an agreement for lease with Netflix in respect of stages, workshops and offices at Shepperton Studios in relation to the Shepperton Expansion Project. See “Business—Material Contracts— _Netflix Shepperton South Long-term Contract.” For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, our Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA would have been £94.3 million, giving pro forma effect to the anticipated EBITDA effects of certain pre-leased space currently being constructed as part of the expansion projects to be funded in connection with the Offering and adding back the effect of certain costs related to the UK Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, ----- as illustrated in the table below. For a reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Statistical, As Adjusted and Other Financial Data.” We have averaged over 93% cash conversion over the past three fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. Maintenance capital expenditure has averaged approximately £3.4 million per annum for the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2021. In addition to this maintenance capital expenditure, we recognised an average of approximately £4.3 million of maintenance spend per annum as an expense within indirect costs for the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2021.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.2,World Class Facilities with Significant Freehold Backing,"We own the freehold interest of both Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, which are valued at a Market Value of £2,158 million pursuant to the Valuation Report. Pro forma for the remaining capex expected to be incurred for the Shepperton Expansion Project and new stage construction at Pinewood West, the adjusted valuation would be £2,672 million. This valuation is supported by the Disney Long-term Contract and the Netflix Long-term Contract which ensure 100% occupancy of our current Stage and Other Production Accommodation for the duration of the contracts, each of which has an initial term of at least ten years as well as the Netflix Shepperton South Long-term Contract. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios are the two largest independent studios in the United Kingdom with a combined approximate 2.0 million square feet of space set over 502 acres and 25 and 14 stages, respectively, close to central London and Heathrow airport. Pinewood Studios is one of the largest independently operated studios in the world in terms of stage space, with approximately 1.4 million square feet of total space on an approximately 379-acre site. It currently has two facilities, Pinewood West and Pinewood East. Shepperton Studios has approximately 600,000 square feet of total space situated on an approximately 123-acre site. It currently has one facility, Shepperton North, and two additional facilities under development, Shepperton North West and Shepperton South. Our studios are capable of hosting productions of various budgets simultaneously. We believe, however, that production companies view our studios as a premium offering well suited for large budget productions, for release either in theatres or on streaming platforms, given the extent and quality of the infrastructure available. Our studios feature a wide range of different size purpose-built stages, workshops, and offices as well as specialised facilities such as exterior and interior water tanks, backlots, television stages, and post production facilities. We further believe that our operational capabilities, resulting from decades of experience running a secured environment, providing 24/7 access where the most demanding production companies can operate, also differentiates us from most of our competitors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.5,Industry with Exceptional Fundamentals,"Our customers operate in a market with strong underlying demand, which is driven by consumption of content, principally blockbuster films and from online streaming platforms. In recent years, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for content from streaming platforms has accelerated. To match this demand, OTT operators have significantly increased their investments in content production. The number of streaming platforms has multiplied in recent years, and operators continue to invest considerably in streaming content, such as Disney, Apple, NBCUniversal and Warner Media. Disney has invested in Disney+, its own direct-to-consumer streaming platform, and expects their investment in original content for this streaming platform to exceed $8 billion by 2024, more than double the amount that was estimated in April 2019. When Disney launched Disney+ in November 2019, 10 million people subscribed on the first day. Disney+ had 87 million subscribers as of September 30, 2021 and is targeting between 230 and 260 million subscribers by 2024. In 2019, Apple increased its committed spending for original video content over the next several years from $1.0 billion to $6.0 billion. NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast, launched its own OTT platform, Peacock, in April 2020 and had 19 million subscribers as of September 2021. Warner Media also launched its own OTT platform, HBO Max, in May 2020 and had 58 million subscribers as of June 2021. In 2021, Warner Media announced that it would premiere 17 movies simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max in the United States. Collectively Disney, Apple, NBCUniversal, Comcast and Warner Media have over 100 million subscribers to their OTT platforms. We believe long-term planning associated with spending on original content by OTT operators and on franchise films (such as the Marvel super hero franchise, Star Wars or James Bond), has resulted in larger and more predictable annual slates for a number of production companies. Consequently, such production companies are often committing to take production space further in advance of filming (traditionally three months in advance and now up to twelve months in advance). On the back of this demand, in 2019 we entered into the Long-term Contracts with Disney and Netflix who occupy space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. As we continue to see favorable demand-supply fundamentals for purpose-built studio infrastructure, in 2021 we entered into a new long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.6,Significant Barriers to Entry,"The ability to attract large budget productions requires a complex ecosystem, including comprehensive infrastructure with excellent operations, a highly skilled English-speaking workforce (ideally based in close proximity to the studio), good transport links (particularly by air), and a location close to an international city where talent is willing to reside. We benefit from infrastructure developed over decades of hosting films, with a multitude of stage options, as well as a specialist underwater facility, a paddock tank and backlot sites for outdoor filming, ample workshop and office space, businesses on-site providing services to production companies, theatres on-site for post-production editing and convenient transport links. We also benefit from a convenient location, with both Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios approximately one hour from central London and approximately 30 minutes from Heathrow airport. Aside from convenience for our customers, being located close to central London offers certain other strategic advantages. According to the Office for National Statistics, as of 2020 there were approximately 65,967 film and video production workers in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 66% based in London and South East England, which is a draw for major film production companies seeking a location to produce blockbuster films or Highend TV. The production sector workforce has increased by approximately 78% since 2010, at a CAGR of approximately 6%. The production sector workforce has increased by 3% since 2017, at a CAGR of approximately 1%. Whereas studios in many other jurisdictions may require the transport and accommodation of film crews at significant cost, filming at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios provides proximate access to producers, directors, actors, cinematographers and a large skilled worker base including, among others, technicians, engineers, carpenters, make-up artists and wardrobe specialists. Top talent, including producers, directors and cast, are also attracted to London as a filming destination and temporary residence while filming. While there are a number of proposed new studios at various stages of development in the United Kingdom, we believe that any potential competitor would still experience difficulties in locating and developing similarly-sized, well-located sites near central London due to scarcity of land, planning restrictions, high alternative land use values and high build costs. Even if such a site were available, the considerable time and expense required to build similar infrastructure to that of Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, is likely to deter most new market entrants. Additionally, we benefit from relationships with multiple major film production companies spanning decades and such relationships cannot be easily or quickly replicated by new market entrants.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.7,Importance of Creative Industries to the UK Economy,"The United Kingdom’s success in the creative industries is driven by a wide range of specialist subsectors, creating a rich, cross-disciplinary environment for collaboration and innovation. The creative industries are defined by DCMS to include film and television production, software services, music, the performing arts, advertising and marketing, publishing, and design. Employment in the creative industries grew at a CAGR of 4% between 2011 and 2021. In 2021, the creative industries employed over two million people, or about 7% of the United Kingdom’s work force. Within the United Kingdom creative industries, film and video production constitutes an important driver of employment, economic output and exports. In recent years, the United Kingdom has benefited from increase in production spend. According to BFI, production spend on UK feature films and High-end TV increased at a CAGR of 15% between 2017 and 2021. Inward investments continue to drive the overall spending with bigger budget films taking space in the United Kingdom.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Key Strengths,9.2.8,Solid Growth Potential with Demonstrated Track Record of Development,"We have achieved consistent growth over the past several years, with Adjusted EBITDA increasing from £44.7 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 to £64.0 million in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2021. This growth has principally been driven by our core rental business with steady demand-led increases in our rental rates, increased occupancy and investment in the business. A significant driver in our ability to generate cash has been our track record of pre-letting and completing development projects on time and within budget. For example, (i) in 2016, we developed approximately 300,000 square feet in connection with Pinewood East Phase 1, and (ii) in 2019, we developed approximately 205,000 square feet in connection with Pinewood East Phase 2 (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately ----- 39,000 square feet, completed in summer 2020). Pinewood East Phase 1 and Pinewood East Phase 2 were leased prior to or immediately after completion, demonstrating our track record of accurately assessing demand and judicious approach to development. In recent years, we have experienced, and continue to experience, excess demand which we believe we will be able to accommodate through further expansion of our existing studios. At Pinewood Studios, we have planned for future revenue growth through pre-letting five sound stages, currently under construction, to Disney and through obtaining planning consent for the future development of Pinewood East Phase 3. Additionally, we own two undeveloped land sites adjacent to the existing facilities totalling approximately 165 acres, which we may use for development in the future. At Shepperton Studios, we are pursuing an expansion on the undeveloped land adjacent to the existing facilities totalling approximately 97 acres, which would add a further approximately 1.0 million square feet of space. The expansion has been substantially de-risked with the long-term contract with Netflix and the signing of a fixed price contract for the construction.

We intend to continue to remain focused on providing the infrastructure required to produce film and television content and providing exceptional customer service.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.2,Continue to Expand Our Footprint at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios,"In autumn 2019, we completed the development of Pinewood East Phase 2, comprising approximately 205,000 square feet of stage, workshop and office space (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately 39,000 square feet, completed in summer 2020). The entire development is included in the demise of the Disney Long-term Contract. Looking ahead, we are actively pursuing various expansion projects at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios that will allow us to meet the stable, excess demand for our facilities. The United Kingdom, with its established ecosystem and stable tax incentives, remains one of the most attractive markets for major film production companies and streaming platforms to produce content. We believe that our established locations, combined with the existing infrastructure at our UK studios, afford us a competitive advantage. At Pinewood Studios, and as part of the Disney Long-term Contract, Disney pre-let five new stages at Pinewood West, for which construction is underway and is expected to complete in 2022, adding approximately 100,000 square feet of lettable area and contributing to the future growth of the business. Additionally, the Group also has outline planning consent to develop a further approximately 120,000 square feet in relation to Pinewood East Phase 3. In addition, in September 2020, we submitted an outline planning consent application for the 77 ----- acre site adjacent to Pinewood Studios which we acquired in August 2020 and we refer to as Pinewood South. We expect to receive a decision from the local planning authority before January 2022, and if successful, the planning application would give us the ability to build a global screen industries growth hub comprising (i) additional production accommodation space, (ii) a visitor experience, (iii) an education hub, and (iv) a business growth hub totaling approximately 750,000 square feet. See “—Business—Studios and Facilities—Pinewood Studios.” At Shepperton Studios, we are pursuing an expansion which will add a further 17 new sound stages and Other Production Accommodation space totalling approximately 1.0 million square feet of lettable area in aggregate across two phases. Shepperton North West, the first phase of this expansion, comprises three sound stages and Other Production Accommodation totalling approximately 165,000 square feet. Enabling and early works commenced in May 2021 and we contracted Sir Robert McAlpine to undertake the main works for the development in October 2021. The development is expected to complete in the first half of 2023. Shepperton South, the second larger phase of the expansion, comprises 14 sound stages and Other Production Accommodation totalling approximately 800,000 square feet. Enabling and early works commenced in August 2021 and we have signed a fixed-price main works contract with Laing O’Rourke in November 2021. The development is expected to complete towards the end of 2023. Additionally, we entered into a long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. The lease will commence on completion of the development, expected towards the end of 2023, and is on terms similar to the Netflix Long-term Contract. There is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton. Our range of expansion plans that are underway and under consideration are projects, with both short and long-term timeframes, that will allow us to meet the demands of our customers. We continue to adopt a prudent approach to any expansion by conducting various detailed feasibility studies to assess viability and risks and also seek to de-risk the income by entering into long-term rental contracts in advance of the construction completion. In addition, if we undertake any future expansion opportunities for which work has not commenced, we will implement a prudent approach towards financing. We work with reputable construction companies with a track record of timely project completion and have contracts in place that incentivize timely and cost-efficient completions. Our business is highly cash generative and we expect to be able to fund a certain amount of expansionary investment through internal cash generation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Expanding internationally allows us to capitalise on our existing brand and operational structure, resulting in synergies and an efficient use of resources. We have formulated our strategy for international expansion, focusing on key established markets within North America, Europe, Australia and emerging markets such as China and India, which could be attractive due to the rapidly growing box office sales and strong demand for locally produced content.

The sale agreement included earnout provisions linked to the financial performance of the studios for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the sale proceeds included £0.6 million related to the earnout payments received following the disposal. (b) Other operating expenses/(income) adjusted items (excluding impairment of property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 represents £2.8 million for the sale of the Group’s interest in POP Global Ltd in February 2020. Previously, this investment was fully impaired and held at nil cost. Offsetting this amount was £2.6 million of land transfer tax which was calculated and paid in the year in relation to restructuring the Group’s property portfolio to optimise ownership across subsidiary undertakings.

Our key competitors tend to be located in areas with availability of local crews, close to gateway cities with good transport links and usually in English speaking territories offering well established, stable tax incentive schemes. Internationally, key competing locations include (i) Los Angeles, which has the greatest concentration of competitor studios such as Warner Bros., NBCUniversal and Sony Pictures, (ii) New York, (iii) Vancouver, which benefits from being in the same time zone as Los Angeles, (iv) Atlanta, and (v) Toronto. We also compete internationally with studios in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Italy, Germany, Australia and other countries. We face the risk of increased competition from potential new market entrants. For example, the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham has plans to develop a 20-acre site into new film production studios. In addition, in 2020 Sky announced its plan to develop a 32-acre site at Elstree Studios into a new TV and film studio in partnership with Legal & General. There are a number of proposed new facilities at early stages of development or seeking planning permission in the United Kingdom. Hudson Pacific Properties and Blackstone Group announced plans to develop a 91-acre site in Hertfordshire and the University of Reading with affiliates of Commonwealth Real Estate LP received planning permission for the development of a studio complex at Shinfield Studios. There are a number of other potential or proposed studio developments across the United Kingdom. While we believe the scale of our business and reputation, combined with significant barriers to entry within our market, such as the difficulties associated with obtaining planning consent and the frequently higher alternative use values, may mitigate the impact of competition from these proposed new developments, particularly in the London area, there can be no assurance that existing and future competition, including competition from new developments and market entrants, will not affect our market share and have negative effects on our business. Furthermore, should existing competing studios either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere invest significantly to improve their offerings, or new market entrants successfully establish a presence either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, this may result in increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. ----- We also compete with temporary facilities and location filming and the risk that our own customers will develop and/or expand their own in-house film and television production capabilities. Competition may require us to make significant new investments or reduce rental rates to avoid losing new and existing customers. Historically, our business largely depended on repeat business from, and sustained relationships with, certain customers. Since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, we have limited space available to accommodate customers (other than Disney and Netflix) and available space for such customers depends on us either developing additional space not subject to the Long-term Contracts or offering existing space that is not required under the terms of the Long-term Contracts. Although we have longstanding relationships with most of our other historical customers and we believe that our relationships with those customers are stable, our ability to enter into new contracts with them for new space that becomes available may be negatively impacted by the Longterm Contracts. As a potential consequence of the Long-term Contracts, third parties, including existing competing studios or our customers, may prioritise and invest in, or otherwise build, alternative sites in order to guarantee sufficient production space for their productions which would previously have been produced at our studios. In addition, customers and production companies may establish relationships with third-party studios and other competitors to facilitate their production needs during the term of the Long-term Contracts and there can be no assurance that we can maintain or re-establish relationships with such production companies during or after the completion or termination of the Long-term Contracts. There can be no assurance that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Discretionary consumer spending, including spending on entertainment such as blockbuster films and online streaming platforms, is affected by global economic conditions. Demand for blockbuster films and online streaming platforms, for which the provision of required infrastructure is our operational specialty, may decrease if disposable income decreases, unemployment increases or spending habits change to reflect any increased uncertainty or apprehension regarding economic conditions. While demand for blockbuster films and online streaming platforms has been generally resilient through market downturn, we cannot guarantee that this will continue to be the case. A significant deterioration or sustained decline in economic conditions or the continued widespread closure of cinemas due to, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic could reduce demand for blockbuster films and online streaming platforms and, in turn, adversely impact production companies and result in reduced demand for any of our services and planned or future studios and facilities that are not subject to the Long-term Contracts. If economic conditions deteriorate in any of the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that the valuation of our properties will not decline, nor that such deterioration of economic conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical conditions (particularly in the eurozone and the United Kingdom as a result of Brexit, and globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) also poses a risk to our commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. While we are subject to the Longterm Contracts for initial terms of at least ten years, if the current economic situation deteriorates significantly, or if our customers are forced to cease doing business, our business would be materially adversely impacted.

To the extent that the pound sterling depreciates against the US dollar, the United Kingdom may become a more attractive place to invest for film production purposes, but may also increase the cost of imported supplies for our construction activities and specialist equipment. To the extent that the pound sterling appreciates against the US dollar, film-making that is budgeted in US dollars, but executed in the United Kingdom, could become relatively more expensive and our studios and services in the United Kingdom may be less price ----- competitive in relation to studios and services in the United States and elsewhere. This may have a material adverse impact on turnover attributable to Stage and Other Production Accommodation for our services and planned or future studios and facilities that are not subject to the Long-term Contracts.

The success of our business is underpinned by the integrity of our brand and our reputation for quality of service. We believe favourable recognition of our brand is important to maintaining a key position in an industry where trust and confidence with customers is paramount. Factors affecting brand recognition, such as negative publicity following an accident or other safety incident involving loss of life or injury, are often outside our control, and our efforts to maintain or enhance favourable brand recognition may not have their desired effects. We are also exposed to possible brand damage from poor customer service performance at our studios in the United Kingdom or at the studios of our international partners operating under the Pinewood brand. We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions, the reputations and actions of our international partners, press speculation and negative publicity, among other matters, whether or not founded, could damage our brand and our reputation. Any decline in perceived favourable recognition of our studios could have an adverse impact on the reputation of our ancillary and other business lines, and vice versa. A decline in favourable recognition of our brand could also impact our ability to attract or retain customers.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.6,"We are exposed to risks related to the Shepperton Expansion Project and new stage construction at Pinewood West as well as any other expansion projects we may undertake in the future, each of which may require the application of significant capital expenditures. Such risks include the inability to complete such projects on time or at all, the inability to generate the desired returns therefrom, the credit risks or the risk of insolvency of our construction contractors or the inability to raise additional capital as might be required to complete such projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","The net proceeds from the Offering, along with cash on balance sheet, are intended to be allocated to fund expansion projects, including the Shepperton Expansion Project and five new stages at Pinewood West, and to pay fees and expenses. On account of the size and complexity of the Shepperton Expansion Project, and the large number of parties involved, the Shepperton Expansion Project presents a number of risks which may materialize over the various phases of the construction process as well as various unexpected practical issues as the development progresses. Impediments to the proper execution of construction projects include, for example, ineffective project management, any failure to perform against contractual obligations on the part of a contractor, delays in obtaining construction inputs and supplies and potential nonperformance or potential insolvency of a contractor. In addition, external factors, such as adverse weather conditions, may negatively affect the execution of the Shepperton Expansion Project and/or the new stage construction at Pinewood West and our other expansion projects. While we intend to allocate the net proceeds of the Offering to fund expansion projects, including the Shepperton Expansion Project and five new stages at Pinewood West, we may require additional funding for the foregoing expansion projects and/or other capital expenditure plans and the ongoing maintenance and expansion of our sites will depend upon a number of factors, including the rate at which we choose to implement the Shepperton Expansion Project and other development projects, which will depend on the contractors’ and other service providers’ abilities and resources as well as our judgement of the demand for the increased space. If the plans or assumptions set out in our business plan change or prove to be inaccurate, or if we make any material acquisitions, we may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available or, if available, can be concluded on terms acceptable to us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the expansion projects, including the Shepperton Expansion Project or the new stage construction at Pinewood West, in a timely manner or at all. Completed construction may contain defects or may not be completed to our specifications which could require us spend time and incur expenses, including through legal action, to cure and/or seek damages and our remedies may be limited ----- by contract, insurance limitations and/or the viability of our contractor or subcontractors. We also cannot guarantee that, if completed, these investments and initiatives will yield the anticipated or desired results, including, but not limited to, increased capacity and turnover or, if turnover does increase, that the additional turnover will be sufficient to recover the amounts invested and/or provide the desired return on such investments. A failure to realise the anticipated or desired results on such investment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to the potential risk of underperformance or nonperformance by our contractors, who might not be able to deliver on projects as initially anticipated in terms of cost and time to completion. Whilst we seek to work with contractors on fixed-price contracts or with a degree of fixity, where the potential liabilities related to potential delays or cost over-runs lie with the contractors, we cannot rely on negotiating fixed price contracts on construction projects in future. Also, if a contractor encounters financial difficulties or becomes insolvent, they might face hurdles and delays in honouring such liabilities or might not be able to fulfil them at all. We have certain guarantees in our contracts with construction contractors in a potential event of insolvency. However, claims over such guarantees might be delayed or might not succeed at all and as a result may delay the overall project timeline and increase the potential costs associated with the development. Furthermore, our contractors and their vendors may be subject to their own operating, financial and regulatory risks. While such expansion opportunities could be frustrated or not come to fruition, to the extent they do, they will involve a substantial amount of capital expenditure and will result in us incurring development risk. For example, the final amount of capital expenditure required for a development or project could be higher than that originally estimated. In addition, although there is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton, we may not be successful in finding suitable tenants. Furthermore, the length of time required to deliver the projects could be longer than originally estimated due to delays or other unforeseen circumstances, which could result in increased costs, loss of turnover, or could impact our reputation, if we had committed the newly built space before it had been completed. Construction of additional space will most likely take place while the existing studios are in occupation and therefore may cause disruption to our customers which, in turn, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and business.

If the construction or use of such facilities is not conducted in accordance with the relevant planning permission and codes, the relevant council and or regulators may, in certain circumstances, prohibit the use of such facilities until such failure to comply is remedied. Further, a council can require compliance with the conditions of any planning permission or planning agreement, or, in certain circumstances, the alteration or reinstatement of any construction carried out without planning permission. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining planning permissions and maintaining or renewing the necessary licenses or approvals for the facilities at our studios, which could result in delay in construction, the closure of our facilities, or fines. Stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new studios in particular locations. Obtaining planning permission for future developments may be difficult. There are either planned expansions or the potential for expansions at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. For more information on our planned or potential expansions, see “Business—Studios and Facilities.” If we are unable to obtain the requisite planning permissions for these planned expansions at our existing studios, we would be unable to carry out these expansions. We work with and engage our local planning authorities with regard to issues of shared concern that impact the development, redevelopment and expansion of our studios, including sensitivities to site noise, listed structures, road congestion and other traffic issues, and health and safety issues. If we were to fail to cooperate with local planning authorities or if our work relationship with such authorities were to be adversely affected for any reason, this could negatively impact our ability to obtain the requisite planning approvals, consents and licenses necessary for the development, redevelopment or expansion of our studios, or it could result in the withdrawal of existing approvals, consents and licenses.

While occupancy rates are less relevant for the facilities subject to the Long-term Contracts, they remain applicable to planned or future studios and facilities that are not subject to the Long-term Contracts, including, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the remaining 50% of the space to be developed across Shepperton South and Shepperton North West. Occupancy rates are driven by contracted bookings for stages, for which we historically competed with a variety of studios on the basis of availability of space, availability of an appropriately skilled labour force in close proximity to the studios and certain fiscal incentives. Prior to signing the Long-term Contracts, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the occupancy rates of our stages in the United Kingdom, calculated by totalling the total square footage sold and paid for each working day of the period divided by the total space available during such period, was 95%. For an explanation of how we calculate occupancy rates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors _Affecting Results of Operations—Occupancy Rates.” While stage occupancy rates have remained consistently_ high over the past several years, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or obtain such levels or that they will remain stable in the future in relation to studios and facilities that are not subject to the Long-term Contracts. In addition, a decrease in occupancy rates more generally across the industry may adversely impact the value of our properties irrespective of the Long-term Contracts, and could also impact the renewal of our Longterm Contracts.

While we carefully maintain the safety of our studios and certain high-risk activities taking place in our studios (including the use of props and technology involving open flames, pyrotechnics and water) which are the responsibility of the production companies that carry them out while in occupation of our studios, there are inherent risks involved with such activities. An accident or injury at any of our studios, or even an accident or injury at studios operated by our competitors, particularly one that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause the loss of customer confidence and negatively impact our results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. Despite the health and safety measures that we have imposed, incidents involving harm to persons at certain of our properties, as well as damage to property and assets have occurred. For example, we have experienced fire damage, water damage and structural damage in the past that have caused significant damage to some of our studios. Although we have implemented changes to reduce the likelihood of such events happening again, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur in the future. ----- Any accident or other safety incident involving loss of life or injury or damage to property or assets, or the public perception of risk thereof, could expose us to financial risk, including personal injury and other liability claims and criminal proceedings. Internal investigations or investigations by insurers or other interested parties following an accident or other incident involving a stage or other feature of our studios could cause the affected studios to be closed for a temporary period or indefinitely, which could negatively impact our brands and reputation. In addition, mechanical or technical faults in certain specialty equipment or stages, such as the underwater facility, could be subject to closure.

We are also exposed to regulatory and financial liability risks from, for example, hazardous materials or soil and ground water contamination. These laws and regulatory regimes are constantly subject to change and could impose substantial costs upon us and subject us to claims, fines and penalties. For example, recent changes in general sentencing guidelines applicable to The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992 have resulted in the potential for significantly higher fines and prison sentences for health and safety violations. The new guidelines categorise such incidents by level of actual harm and the risk of potential harm. As a result, if an incident could have caused a fatal injury, such incident will be categorised under a high level of harm, even if the resulting injury is minor or if no injury results. For companies with annual turnovers in excess of £50 million, such as ours, there is no limit to the fine that can be imposed. There can be no assurance that any or all of the regulatory and licensing and authorization frameworks under which we operate will not become more restrictive in the future. Our strategy to expand internationally increases our risk exposure to political and regulatory changes. The impact of, and costs associated with, complying with changes in interpretation of existing, or the adoption of new, legislation, regulations or other laws or licensing and authorization regimes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in which we have plans to operate, can be difficult to anticipate or estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regarding environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, a number of the buildings at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios were built with materials containing asbestos. Although we have a health and safety process for managing the presence of any such asbestos, including any works that need to be undertaken in accordance with health and safety legislation and by licensed asbestos contractors, we cannot guarantee that there will not be a deterioration of the condition of any asbestos at our facilities. We have received claims related to asbestos at our studios and, even though we maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance coverage with respect to these claims, there can be no guarantee that our policies will continue to cover such claims or that our level of coverage will be adequate to cover our liabilities. There is no current requirement to remove all of the asbestos at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, however, should such removal become necessary (as a result of United Kingdom or European Union legislative changes or otherwise), the cost could be significant and such removal may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face various development risks and or constraints as a result of the ground conditions upon which some of our facilities are located. For example, a parking lot and two stages at Pinewood Studios partially sit upon a former landfill. While this land is periodically monitored with respect to gas and liquid leakage, we cannot guarantee that our monitoring will detect all leakage or that, in the case of detection, our remedial measures will be sufficient to contain such leakage. We have in the past, detected a gas leak in one of our stages at Pinewood East and undertook remedial measures. We cannot assure you that our remedial measures will be effective or that such similar leaks will not occur in the future. Moreover, if an accident or other unanticipated event were to result in the leakage of gas or liquid from the former landfill at Pinewood Studios, there is a risk that filming at those studios could be interrupted or otherwise affected thus potentially adversely impacting our rental income. Additionally, part of the land planned for expansion works at Shepperton Studios is a former mineral extraction site. If any environmental issues are uncovered, such matters could potentially result in more expensive engineering solutions. We may also be held liable for claims, penalties or fines from government authorities, individuals and other third parties arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials, soil and ground water contamination or as a result of any environmental damage. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover these ----- claims, penalties or fines and/or such claims, penalties or fines may result in a material change in the terms on which such insurance is renewed (including substantial increases to our insurance premiums). We cannot guarantee that our current provisions and measures for compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will be sufficient to cover any incidents, accidents or other liability, and the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Many of these labourers are members of unions and are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. For purposes of productions that require these services or that may utilise planned or future studios and facilities that are not subject to the Long-term Contracts, a strike or the possibility of a strike could cause such productions to slow down or stop due to the length of the strike and/or inability to reach agreement on a new union contract. This could result in occupancy rates below our expectations in connection with our planned or future studios and facilities that are not subject to the Long-term Contracts. For example, a Screen Actors Guild strike that lasted for four months between 2007 and 2008 disrupted production companies’ operations, reducing demand for our studios and resulting in decreased occupancy rates. An inability to reach agreement on one or more of such ----- union contracts or renewal on less favourable terms may also have an adverse effect on our customers operations and could have a corresponding adverse impact on the demand for our planned or future studios and facilities that are not subject to the Long-term Contracts. Should there be a major disruption in the supply of labour at our studios or demand for our studios and services for any of the foregoing reasons or otherwise, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely effected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Interruption or loss of access to such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our computer systems also store information about our customers and certain of their own information, some of which is sensitive data. We have, from time to time, experienced unsuccessful attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our computer systems and networks. In the current environment, there are numerous and evolving risks to cyber security, including criminal hackers, other unauthorized external or internal attempts to access our information technology systems and human or technological error. Although we believe we have taken and continue to take reasonable and appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems, our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain and protect it from theft, unauthorized access or inadvertent loss. Litigation, adverse publicity or other consequences from a breach of our information technology systems, whether external or internal, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the breach of our security procedures at our studios, the studios of our international partners or the studios of our competitors may generate adverse media coverage of us or the production studio industry generally, resulting in regulatory changes that affect our industry and may adversely affect the general attitudes of potential customers towards us and our brand. A breach of our security procedures may result in the exposure of our customers’ intellectual property to the public. This risk is compounded by the increased influence of social media as well as the ready availability of cameras on mobile devices. Similarly, we are subject to data protection legislation (including the Data Protection Act 2018). Noncompliance or technical defects resulting in a leak or the misuse of personal data could subject us to significant financial penalties depending on the type and severity of the breach.

These risks and hazards could also result in damage to, or the destruction of, studios, personal injury, environmental damage, business interruption, monetary losses and possible legal liability. In particular, the success of our operations depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the infrastructure available at our studios and used to deliver our services. A failure of our infrastructure due to unforeseen disaster could occur. Our disaster recovery procedures cover specific disasters at our studios, and we believe that they are appropriate. However, it is not possible to cover every eventuality. A natural or man-made disaster may occur that we have not provided for, and while we maintain insurance and disaster recovery plans, such insurance policies and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us. Such disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business. Were a significant terrorist attack to take place that diminishes confidence in international flights, this could limit willingness of US-based production teams to travel to our studios. Were a significant terrorist attack to take place in the United Kingdom, this could affect the willingness of international film artists and production teams to work in the United Kingdom and specifically in the London region due to a perceived security threat. This could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Some of the artists who work at our studios are high profile. While we make every effort to maintain a secure environment and a production team will typically ----- also include its own security professionals, if a security incident were to occur to an artist while on-site, this could damage our reputation. While we currently maintain insurance policies at levels we believe are consistent with industry practice, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such insurance cover at reasonable rates, or at all, or that any cover obtained will be adequate and available to cover all possible claims. Inability to recover insurance claims or to obtain future insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The government in the United Kingdom imposed two national lockdowns in addition to periodic tier-based restrictions from time to time. While Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios have remained open and fully operational, and the Long-term Contracts and the rent payments thereunder have not been impacted, we cannot assure you that our studios and facilities will not be closed or that our operations will not be disrupted as a result of future lockdowns or other COVID-19-related disruptions. We cannot provide assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgence or further variant, or any outbreak of other contagious diseases will not have a material adverse effect on our future operations. The circumstances of the current COVID-19 pandemic are changing rapidly, and at this time we are unable to reasonably estimate the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our financial results and liquidity, as well as operations. The future developments of the COVID-19 pandemic could give rise to circumstances that result in one or more of the following: - we could be subject to changes in laws and governmental regulations that adversely affect our business and operations; - we may face prolonged work stoppages at our facilities, including total or partial shutdowns of one or more of our stages or production buildings; - we may experience disruptions to our agreements and operations as result of a government mandated or other closure and any other unforeseen circumstances; - we may be subject to disruptions in demand for our facilities or our customers may try to terminate their leases; - we could lose key customers, customers could become insolvent or we could have a reduction or volatility in demand for our facilities; - we may be subject to customers failing to make timely payments or defaulting on payments; - the third parties on which we rely, such as suppliers, may fail to meet their obligations to us, or may face significant disruptions in their ability to do so; - we could face increased costs and decreased income due to, for example, the need to enforce social distancing measures; - we could face increased costs or delays in our expansion projects related to supply chain challenges, disruptions, or financial difficulties faced by our contractors; - we could be subject to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates; - our activities, events and projects may be cancelled or delayed which may negatively impact relationships with our customers; ----- - we may experience a disruption or delay in executing our strategic capital initiatives due to travel restrictions and/or health and safety concerns; - we may face higher employee compensation costs, as well as incremental costs associated with implementing enhanced protocols to protect our employees; - we might lose key management and operating personnel; - we may be impacted by government budget constraints, tax constraints or government shutdowns; - our goodwill and other long-lived assets could become impaired; - our access to capital markets may be restricted, which could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations, including those under the Notes; and - we may be impacted by deterioration in the global credit, financial and economic environment, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on the severity and duration of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict.

Property valuations, including those used in the Valuation Report, are prepared on the basis of various assumptions, estimates and projections. We cannot assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in the Valuation Report are correct, accurate or complete. Further, the Valuation Report expressly does not contain a valuation of any portion of our business that is not connected to our freehold properties and land. Actual results may differ materially from the assumptions and projections used and estimates made in the Valuation Report, for example, changes in the demand for our services and changes in rental prices. Other appraisers may reach different valuations of our property portfolio. Moreover, the value determined in the Valuation Report could be significantly higher than the amount that would be obtained from the actual sale of our property portfolio, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario or if the properties are sold on an individual basis. Accordingly, the Valuation Report should not be considered a representation of the actual present or future value of our property portfolio. The realizable value of our property portfolio at any given time will depend on various factors, including but not limited to: - market, economic and media production industry conditions, including demand and capacity for our studios and services; - whether any property sales are anticipated; - the effect any sale may have on the remaining portfolio; - the availability of buyers; - the availability of financing; - the time period in which the properties are to be sold; - the supply of similar properties; ----- - the condition of the properties; - regulatory and political risks, including obtaining any necessary consents required to transfer our studio operations; and - other operational cost risks. In addition, we anticipate that the appraised value of our property portfolio will change over time, and it may change materially.

During the transition period, the majority of rights and obligations associated its membership in the European Union continued to apply to the United Kingdom. On December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom announced that they had reached the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was implemented on December 31, 2020 and entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially in practice from the terms before withdrawal. Lack of clarity about future laws and regulations in the United Kingdom as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. Political parties in several other member states of the EU have proposed that a similar referendum be held on their country’s membership in the EU. It is unclear whether any other member states of the EU will hold such referendums, but further disruption can be expected if there are. Political instability in the EU as a result of Brexit may result in a material negative effect on credit markets and foreign direct investments in Europe. A potential deterioration in economic conditions could result in increased unemployment rates, increased short term and long term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, a decline in the strength of national and local economies, and other results that could negatively impact household income. Areas where the uncertainty created by the UK’s withdrawal from the EU is relevant include, but are not limited to, asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings, which have been, and may continue to be, subject to increased market volatility. Any reduction in the willingness or the ability of our customers to pay their debts due to Brexit-related changes in the economic environment of the United Kingdom or the European Union could materially affect our revenue and our ability to perform debt collection in a manner consistent with our past practice. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the dollar and the British pound sterling could negatively impact us if it becomes more expensive for major film production companies from the United States and other countries to utilise our studios and facilities. Additionally, our existing contractors may be able to pass through any increased construction cost due to Brexit.

These difficulties may include, among other things, the integration of certain operating and IT systems, the loss of customers or key employees, diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, procedures and policies. Furthermore, certain contracts between an acquired business and third parties may have terms and conditions that are weaker than our standard contracts, and we may not be able to integrate or update them as quickly as we would like or without incurring significant fees. In addition, we may not have, or be able to retain or hire, employees with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with our integration plans, particularly in the expected time frame in which we require them, and could experience employee departures and early retirement due to relevant business changes, all of which could adversely affect the success of the integration plans. In particular, the loss of key managers or other experienced and knowledgeable local employees, may result in the loss of knowledge and continuity for the relevant business. The integration process for any acquisition or acquired business, if implemented ineffectively, would likely restrict the realisation of the full expected benefits, including revenue generation and/or any cost savings or anticipated synergies. The failure to integrate any acquisition or acquired business efficiently or otherwise in accordance with our expectations could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, in order to fully integrate the financial accounting systems of an acquired businesses, we may be required to update and enhance our internal accounting systems and processes and our internal controls over financial reporting. This may require additional capital investments by us, and may require incremental ----- resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods. In addition, the integration processes may require significant time and attention from our management team, resulting in a drop in performance of the existing business linked to the diversion of attention from our day-to-day operations. Moreover, we may face unexpected and significant delays in completing the integration processes. Failure to identify and remediate deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner could prevent us from accurately and timely reporting our financial results and lead to a loss of investor confidence.

Any changes in demand for these productions or technological developments resulting in decreased demand for our studios could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","Our business is influenced by demand for production of new screen content and large budget film productions. Historically, demand for our studios has been largely dependent on trends in the media industry and audience demand for blockbuster films and High-end TV, which must generally be filmed at large studios such as ours. The demand for blockbuster films and High-end TV that our customers produce is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. The availability of new screen content and changes in consumer preferences may in the future make it more difficult for our customers to predict or fulfil this demand accurately. Our success depends in part on our customer’s ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing consumer demands and preferences, and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable merchandise offerings. If our customers are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends or if they misjudge the market, the renewal of any Long-term Contract and the value of our properties may be adversely impacted, and our occupancy rates for new space not subject to Long-term Contracts could be lower, resulting in lower turnover which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a decrease in occupancy rates more generally across the industry may adversely impact the value of our properties irrespective of the Long-term Contracts, and could also impact the renewal of any Longterm Contract. Further, there may be advances in technology in the media industry that make the processes and techniques currently utilised at our studios obsolete or less desirable, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Should there be a trend towards productions that do not require stages, for example, animation or location filming, this could also impact on the demand for our studios, which could impact the renewal of any Long-term Contract and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Demand for film production studios in the United Kingdom is driven in part by this tax regime and its attractiveness relative to tax regimes in other countries that can supply the same scale and quality of production studios, such as the United States or Canada. Such tax incentive regimes in the United Kingdom and elsewhere are subject to changes in legislation and judicial interpretation. In particular, the tax incentive arrangements applicable to the UK film industry continue to attract scrutiny from the UK government, HMRC, the media and the courts. If the UK Film Tax Relief were discontinued or changed to a less incentivizing regime, it could damage the attractiveness of the United Kingdom as a destination for film-making and may have a material adverse effect on our occupancy rates and turnover, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the policies applicable to us and our customers with respect to UK Film Tax Relief will not be eliminated or scaled back, thereby reducing the advantages that they currently provide to us and our customers. Changes to similar tax incentive regimes in other jurisdictions (such as the states of California and Georgia in the United States, the province of British Columbia and the Member States of Hungary and Croatia) ----- could add to, or detract from, the relative attraction of film making in the United Kingdom. If UK Film Tax Relief were to be reduced, amended or eliminated, if our customers no longer qualified for UK Film Tax Relief, or were other jurisdictions to increase or change their incentives, our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the establishment by other jurisdictions (particularly by the United States) of taxes on the importation of films produced in other jurisdictions, could outweigh the economic benefit gained from UK Film Tax Relief and could, in turn, reduce the attractiveness of the United Kingdom and specifically our studios as a destination for producing films. While changes in tax regimes may not directly impact our turnover attributable to the Long-term Contracts, such changes could impact turnover for additional space not subject to Long-term Contracts or the renewal of the Long-term Contracts, as well as the value of our properties.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Offering, we would have had £1,050.0 million of total third-party borrowings, comprising the Notes (excluding capital debt issuance costs). See “Capitalisation.” In addition, we have available borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility which we may draw in the future, comprising £50.0 million of current commitments but with respect to which on or prior to the Issue Date, the Company expects to enter into an Additional Increase Confirmation (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) which, subject to the satisfaction of various conditions precedent set out therein, will increase the total commitments by £15.0 million to £65.0 million. Further increases to the Revolving Credit Facility may occur in the future. The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. We have historically, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in our monthly and intramonth working capital, which have historically been driven by our lease payment structure. In addition, our intramonth working capital varies significantly due to regularly scheduled payments on certain days of each month to our trade creditors as well as to our employees. As a result, we may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of our working capital requirements going forward. Drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility will vary and may be substantially higher during certain months and weeks to compensate for months with reduced cash reserves. ----- Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that with respect to a distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture to be secured in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.” Additionally, we could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes._ Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not, prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. The Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement restrict, among other things, our ability to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries; - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - consolidate or merge with other entities; and - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. All these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the _Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_ operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial test under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of this test could result in a restriction on the ability to make new drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and a default or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture and the Existing Notes Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay those amounts in full, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated turnover growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realised or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of any then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which (unless the lenders thereunder agree otherwise) will mature on March 30, 2025 (being the date falling six months prior to the maturity of the Existing Notes). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants included in the Indenture and the Existing Notes Indenture. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt. ----- Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realised from such sale would be acceptable.

The Company is in negotiations with the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to amend and restate the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to provide for market standard screen rate replacement language whereby LIBOR would be replaced by SOFR for loans denominated in US dollars (with effect from a rate switch date to be agreed) and by SONIA for loans denominated in sterling (with immediate effect). Fluctuations in EURIBOR, CDOR, LIBOR, SOFR or SONIA may increase our overall interest burden and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of national governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR or EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR or EURIBOR. Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association that sets the regulatory framework for the calculation of EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is determined. In addition, EURIBOR, LIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are or may be the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which were entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, and in subsequent speeches (including the speech by its chief executive on July 12, 2018) the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 and, on March 5, 2021, the FCA further announced the dates on which panel bank submissions for all LIBOR settings will cease, after which representative LIBOR rates will no longer be available (immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all GBP, EUR, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings and the 1-week and 2-month USD settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of all remaining USD settings). The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark, subject to the ongoing negotiations referred to above, will result in the rate of interest in respect of LIBOR-linked borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement being determined with reference to such applicable compounded risk-free rate, which could result in such borrowings being subject to a rate of interest that differs from what LIBOR would have been for an equivalent period. Moreover, subsequent changes in regulatory guidance, industry standards or market practice could result in further changes to way in which LIBOR replacement mechanisms or risk-free rates are drafted, implemented or interpreted. In addition, the potential elimination of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or similar benchmarks are determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or similar benchmarks (including any LIBOR replacement), which could have ----- an adverse impact on our ability to service debt on drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any future indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement permit currency and interest rate hedging and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the Indenture to be secured on a priority basis. In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are greater than the proceeds realised. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations under Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are permitted to rank pari passu and are secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, including the Existing Notes. As a result, proceeds from the sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement action may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for the purpose of enforcement.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing such Notes and Notes Guarantees may be released.

We may increase the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facilities or incur additional Super Senior Liabilities permitted under the Indenture, as a result of which the amount that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. While we have obtained the Valuation Report in connection with the Offering, the fair market value of the Collateral at any point in time may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a result, the value of the Collateral set forth in the Valuation Report or the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realise or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realised upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other Collateral or, if such market does exist, that there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realise or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. ----- The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favour of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding-up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favour of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties.

However, the Indenture provides that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defences. See “Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The_ same limitations may apply to security interests (other than the Notes Guarantees) that will be provided by the Guarantors in certain jurisdictions. Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees or security against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defences available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defences generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalisation, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defences are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee or other security depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Notes Guarantee against any Guarantor. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor; or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantees has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and the Guarantor: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalised or became undercapitalised because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture or other securities pursuant to the Security Documents. ----- We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution, or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. It is possible that the entire Notes Guarantee or other security may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Notes Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments or payments of principal and interest on the intercompany loan that reduce our distributable profits and reserves to zero. We intend to make dividends and enter into intercompany loans to service indebtedness and for tax planning purposes. There can be no assurance that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. The payment of dividends to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees. In addition, the payment under the Notes Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when our group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that our Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” ----- The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalisation or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain net total loan-to-value ratio calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case holders of Notes would not be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of control repurchase price. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions— _Change of Control Triggering Event.”_ The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made to the Principal Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, Transfer Agent, Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture. Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security for the Notes and the Notes Guarantees thereof. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (or its nominee) (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and/or will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, all members of our board and our officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon United States laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.” The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.

These changes may be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the pound sterling against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,Our Business Lines,"Our operations comprise the following six business lines, each of which falls within three broader categories, and as such, we present them throughout this Offering Memorandum in this manner: - rental activities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, comprising Stage and Other Production Accommodation, Media Hub and Television Studios; - ancillary activities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, comprising Post Production and Ancillary Studio Services; and - other activities, primarily consisting of International Sales and Marketing. Rental activities are by far the largest contributor to our business, accounting for 92.6% of Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Rental activities typically include income generated by the use of stages, workshops, offices, and TV studios. Demand for our ancillary activities, accounting for 6.0% of Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, is driven in part by demand for our rental activities. These activities typically include post production services, recharging of utilities, and revenue/profit sharing arrangements with third-party providers. The chart below displays the percentage of our Contribution by business line for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. A brief description of each of our business lines is set forth below. _Rental: Stage and Other Production Accommodation_ Our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line relates to Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. As our core business line, Stage and Other Production Accommodation drives the largest proportion of Contribution. Stage rental relates to the rental of stage space and infrastructure required to produce screen content. The stages are used to house the physical set on which action and sounds are recorded. Our stages come in a variety of sizes and types and are generally soundproofed and heated. Pursuant to the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our existing stage space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios has been contracted by Disney and Netflix, respectively. Other Production Accommodation rental primarily relates to the renting of office space and workshop space where sets are created or stored. Demand for Other Production Accommodation is typically driven by demand for our stages. Pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our existing Other Production Accommodation space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios has been contracted by Disney and Netflix, ----- respectively. See “Business—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term Contract” and “Business—Material _Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.”_ Stage and Other Production Accommodation as a percentage of Contribution has continued to increase with the completion of approximately 205,000 square feet of lettable space at Pinewood East Phase 2, which was completed in autumn 2019 (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately 39,000 square feet, completed in summer 2020), and will increase further by approximately 1.1 million square feet in aggregate upon completion of the five new stages at Pinewood West, Shepperton North West and Shepperton South development projects. Disney has pre-let the five new stages at Pinewood West as part of the Disney Long-term Contract and Netflix has pre-let approximately 60% of the space being developed at the Shepperton South studio. For more information on our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line, see “Business—Our Business _Lines—Rental—Stage and Other Production Accommodation.” Rental: Media Hub_ We lease space on-site to independent companies that support film and television production. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios offer approximately 228,000 square feet of space, to approximately 178 independent businesses as of September 30, 2021. The tenants pay rent directly to us and supply their services to the production companies filming at the studios, as well as to external “off-the-lot” customers. Tenants in our Media Hub benefit from association with our strong brand and proximity to their customer base. Historically, the Media Hub has been a secure source of Contribution. There is significant demand for on-site space, with occupancy rates averaging 95% over the past ten fiscal years to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. For more information, see “Summary—Our Key Strengths—Resilient and Cash Generative Business Model Now _Underpinned by Long-term Contracts.” All turnover generated under the Long-term Contracts is reported under_ Stage and Other Production Accommodation. Accordingly, at the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, certain turnover previously reported under the Media Hub business line moved to Other Production Accommodation with any reallocation of the demises in connection with the Long-term Contracts. For more information on our Media Hub business line, see “Business—Our Business Lines— Rental—Media Hub.” _Rental: Television Studios_ We have three dedicated Television Studios available to hire at Pinewood Studios, one of which is contracted to the National Lottery (Camelot). We have relationships with customers such as the BBC, Endemol Shine UK, Fremantle and Avalon, which contribute to the success of this business line. In addition to earning turnover from Television Studio space, we generate turnover from supplying freelance crew as well as owned and hired television equipment. The Television Studios at Pinewood Studios are excluded from the Disney Long-term Contract and we will continue to manage and hire the Television Studios on a case-by-case basis. For more information on our Television Studios business line, see “Business—Our Business Lines—Rental—Television _Studios.” Ancillary: Ancillary Studio Services_ Ancillary Studio Services comprise additional services utilised by production companies hiring Stage and Other Production Accommodation. The key services we provide in this business line are utilities (for example, we offer electricity, water and gas, which are principally passed through at cost to our long-term contract customers) and other services through revenue or profit-sharing agreements with preferred third-party service providers. For more information on our Ancillary Studio Services business line, see “Business—Our Business _Lines—Ancillary—Ancillary Studio Services.” Ancillary: Post Production_ Post Production provides support to content creators. This business line includes localisation services which offer audio mixing in multiple languages for our customers requiring international re-versioning services. In addition, through this business line we offer our customers mixing theatres, cutting rooms, and production offices available for dry hire at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, all of which are excluded from the Long-term Contracts. For more information, see “Business—Our Business Lines—Ancillary—Post Production.” _Other Activities_ We also generate turnover by providing sales, marketing and brand licensing services and consultancy services relating to studio space to other studios around the world. Historically, we provided these services to studios in Atlanta, Canada, China, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, and Wales. On August 5, 2019, we divested ----- our equity interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, although we continued to provide sales and marketing services until October 14, 2020, and it ceased to be a Pinewood branded studio on December 14, 2020. We separately ceased providing services to studios in Malaysia in July 2019 and in Wales on March 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.2,,"We are one of the leading independent providers of the infrastructure that is required to produce film and television content. Founded in 1936 and headquartered in the United Kingdom, we own premium, large-scale facilities, also known as studios, for hosting film, television and other media productions. Our two freehold studios, Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, are set over 502 acres with approximately 2.0 million square feet of space in close proximity to central London, which makes us a preferred choice for major film production companies. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios are valued at a Market Value of £2,158 million pursuant to the Valuation Report. Pinewood-branded studios have hosted over 2,000 films, which have received among them 170 Oscar awards and 230 BAFTA awards and include numerous blockbuster film productions such as 23 out of the 25 James Bond films, 16 out of the 27 Marvel super hero films and 8 out of the 12 Star Wars films. We signed long-term index-linked contracts for 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios with Disney and Netflix, respectively in 2019. Collectively, these Long-term Contracts cover a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet. These contracts are each for an initial term of at least ten years and provide for annual rent increases, subject to floors. Disney utilises Pinewood Studios for its own productions as well as for its affiliated production companies, including Lucasfilm and Marvel. Netflix utilises Shepperton Studios as a production hub to produce original content. The Long-term Contracts simplify our business model, improve the resilience and visibility of our turnover from investment-grade rated tenants, and demonstrate the continued demand for our facilities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. See “Business—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term Contract” and “Business—Material _Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.”_ Demand for purpose-built studio space remains extremely strong. Over the last few years, we have been progressing our expansion plans at our UK studios, Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. Construction is currently underway for five new stages at Pinewood Studios that will provide approximately 100,000 square feet of additional stage space at Pinewood West, which we anticipate opening in 2022. Disney has pre-let these stages pursuant to the Disney Long-term Contract. At Shepperton Studios, we have detailed planning consent to develop an additional approximately 1.0 million square feet of lettable area, adjacent to the existing studio. We intend to develop this expansion in two phases, which we refer to as Shepperton North West and Shepperton South. Construction of both phases is underway and we have entered into fixed price contracts for the works, thereby significantly derisking the execution of these projects. Additionally, we entered into a long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. The lease will commence on completion of the development, expected towards the end of 2023, and is on terms similar to the Netflix Long-term Contract. There is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Contribution from Stage and Other Production Accommodation, together with the specialty stages, accounted for 83.8% of total Contribution. We earned 98.6% of our total Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 in the United Kingdom, with 92.6% representing rental income at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, our two freehold studios. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

We carry out ongoing maintenance capital expenditure on our existing studios, and we have also completed several capital expenditure projects which have enabled us to expand our capacity to accommodate our customers and to upgrade the desirability of our business lines. Upon completion, these projects historically have contributed to increased turnover for subsequent periods. Our capital expenditure costs during the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and the six months ended September 30, 2021 were attributable primarily to the development of five new stages at Pinewood West, enabling works at Shepperton North West and the design and enabling works at Shepperton South expansion, the development of Pinewood East Phase 2, including an associated obligation under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended, to invest in road improvements, the commencement of construction of the five new stages at Pinewood West, the purchase of certain land holdings, Alderbourne Farm, which is an approximately 88-acre site adjacent to Pinewood Studios, Pinewood South, which is an approximately 77-acre site adjacent to Pinewood Studios, and other optimisation activity at our existing sites, together with other capital maintenance activity of existing studio space. For more information on the Shepperton Expansion Projects, see “Business—Studios and Facilities.” In 2014, we secured outline planning consent to develop: (i) approximately 300,000 square feet of space in connection with Pinewood East Phase 1, which was completed in July 2016; (ii) approximately 205,000 square feet in connection with Pinewood East Phase 2, which was completed in autumn 2019 (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately 39,000 square feet, completed in summer 2020) on budget and on time; and (iii) ----- a further approximately 150,000 square feet GEA in connection with Pinewood East Phase 3, and received detailed planning consent for the development of four new sound stages and a workshop totalling approximately 90,000 square feet GEA in June 2021. Construction of the five new stages at Pinewood West is underway and is expected to complete in 2022. Pursuant to the Disney Long-term Contract, Disney has pre-let these five new stages. See “Business—Studios and Facilities—Pinewood Studios.” With this Offering and a portion of the cash available on balance sheet as of September 30, 2021, we expect to fund the remaining capital expenditure associated with the Shepperton Expansion Project and the five stages at Pinewood West. Funds to pay for the foregoing expansion projects are expected to be deployed in the next two and a half years in accordance with the following schedule: approximately 20% in the year ending March 31, 2022, approximately 50% in the year ending March 31, 2023 and the remaining approximately 30% in the year ending March 31, 2024; however, the foregoing disbursement schedule is subject to change as the construction and build-out progresses. Additional capital expenditures related to other expansion projects are expected to be funded from cash generated by operating activities (including new leases that come online related to the Shepperton Expansion Project) and other capital sources consistent with a prudent financial policy. See “Use of Proceeds.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.3,Occupancy Rates,"We collect fees under contracted bookings for our stages, Other Production Accommodation, Media Hub, and Television Studios. For the periods under review, our Stage and Other Production Accommodation occupancy rates were calculated on a weekly basis by square footage and time contracted and paid for. If a customer paid to occupy a facility and then subsequently cancelled, the space was still recorded as being occupied based on the fact that a payment had been received and was non-refundable or was refundable as the space was subsequently resold by us. Stage occupancy is formulated by calculating the proportion of square footage utilised as a percentage of square footage available. Before the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, we faced the uncertainty that should customer demand increase or decrease over a given period, Stage and Other Production Accommodation occupancy rates could increase or decrease accordingly, which could affect turnover generation and costs. However, in connection with the Long-term Contracts, we contracted 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation, and certain areas which were previously occupied by Media Hub tenants, at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios in the United Kingdom with Disney and Netflix, respectively, for the duration of the respective Long-term Contracts. Subsequently, all turnover generated under the Long-term Contracts will be reported under Stage and Other Production Accommodation, and certain turnover previously reported under the Media Hub business line shifted to Other Production Accommodation with any reallocation of the demise in accordance with the Longterm Contracts. As a result, Stage and Other Production Accommodation occupancy rates will remain stable during the duration of these Long-term Contracts. See “Business—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term _Contract” and “Business—Material Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.”_ Turnover from Television Studios typically is generated in the same manner; however, television productions generally occupy our studios for a shorter period of time than film production companies. Our Television Studios are excluded from the Long-term Contracts and, therefore, we anticipate they will continue to operate and be booked in future periods in a manner consistent with the periods under review. We also generated turnover from the provision of utilities and other services to these customers under the Ancillary Studio Services business line. We charge utilities to Disney and Netflix as costs are incurred and, thus, no margin is earned with regard to utilities costs to these customers. Media Hub occupancy rates are calculated under the same method as Stage and Other Production Accommodation occupancy rates. We had Media Hub occupancy rates of 94%, 94%, and 90% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. We collect fees, categorised as turnover attributable to Media Hub, under lease payments from our tenants. Similar to Stage and Other Production Accommodation, should customer demand increase or decrease over a given period, Media Hub occupancy rates may increase or decrease accordingly, which may affect turnover generation. Therefore, our Media Hub occupancy rate is a key factor affecting our turnover sourced from Media Hub. In addition, customers utilising our Stage and Other Production Accommodation are often customers of tenants in our Media Hub; therefore, higher stage occupancy rates can ultimately lead to higher demand for Media Hub tenant services. See “Business—Material Contracts— _Disney Long-term Contract” and “Business—Material Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.”_ ----- Renting space under the Stage and Other Production Accommodation and Media Hub businesses contributed a majority of our turnover for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Turnover attributable to other business lines, such as Ancillary Studio Services, is also largely affected by stage occupancy rates and historically has grown generally in line with Stage and Other Production Accommodation. We believe this will continue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.4,Rental Rate Changes,"For the periods under review prior to entering into the Long-term Contracts, our rental rates were set taking into account the demand for our stages, Other Production Accommodation and Media Hub Space. These periods were relatively strong and allowed us to undertake consistent annual rental fee increases. Historically, we established a standard rate schedule (our “rate card”) for our business lines, which included specified weekly rental rates for the stages, Other Production Accommodation and Television Studios. Individual production companies may have received discounts against the rental rates appearing on the rate card; however, our realised rental rates have been generally consistent across our major film production company customers. Increases or decreases to our rental rates have a direct impact on the turnover attributable to the affected business line and on our total turnover. Media Hub rental rates are governed by individual leases with each of our tenants, based on an appropriate rate per square foot for the nature and grade of facilities, and for the period of the lease. The rental rates for our Stage and Other Production Accommodation are provided for in the Long-term Contracts with Disney and Netflix. Rent under these Long-term Contracts is either fixed or linked to UK RPI, with rental rate increases if UK RPI reaches certain thresholds. See “Business—Material Contracts.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.5,Post Production and Other International Activity,"Turnover from certain of our business lines, such as Post Production and Other (including International Sales and Marketing), is linked less strongly to our stage occupancy rates, compared with other business lines, such as Stage and Other Production Accommodation. For example, while turnover from Post Production is partially affected by our stage occupancy rates, results from Post Production are significantly impacted by the number of independent projects undertaken. Turnover for Post Production activities is also impacted by the level and experience of staff required and complexity of the individual project. This business line includes localisation services which offers audio mixing in multiple languages for our customers who require international reversioning services. In addition, through this business line we offer our customers mixing theatres, cutting rooms, and production offices available for dry hire at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. Historically, through Post Production we offered picture services and preparation of “dailies,” or raw, unedited production footage prepared at the end of day of filming and creative audio services involving sound mixing and voice over audio. As of summer 2019, we began to phase out our Pinewood Digital “picture services” business and as of spring 2020, we began to phase out our creative audio business. The discontinuation of picture services and creative audio services in our Post Production business line had a negative impact on our consolidated turnover for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. For more information on the activities undertaken in our Post Production business line, see “Business—Our Business Lines—Ancillary—Post Production.” Similarly, our International Sales and Marketing turnover is not linked to stage occupancy rates at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios but is instead primarily affected by new commercial agreements being secured, or existing contracts expiring or being terminated, with only a component of the fees linked to occupancy rates at international Pinewood-branded studios. During July 2019, we announced that the collaboration with Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios ended by mutual agreement in connection with the initial objectives of the collaboration being achieved. On August 5, 2019, we divested our equity interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, although it continued to be a Pinewood-branded studio until December 14, 2020, and we continued to provide sales and marketing services until October 14, 2020. Following discussions with the Welsh Government, our agreement for the studio in Cardiff ended on March 31, 2020. International Sales and Marketing turnover was lower for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, in particular, due to the cessation of the sales and marketing arrangements with the studios in Malaysia, Atlanta and Wales.

They include the purchase price of utilities, rental of temporary accommodation for our customers, staff costs directly associated with the Television Studios, providing Post Production services, studio facility operations and delivering international sales and marketing agreements, all of which have a variable component and are affected by occupancy rates or, in Post Production, by work completed. There is a fixed component to our utilities costs, as there is a minimum amount of utilities spend, such as on electricity, that is required to operate our studios, regardless of occupancy rates. Historically, we have been able to pass through a portion of these costs to our customers, often with a margin. Since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, we have been able to pass through energy costs associated with all Studio space occupied under the contracts at cost. In addition, we have variable costs in relation to equipment and facilities that are hired out to our customers on a cost-plus margin basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Capital expenditure cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset, and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is calculated on all property, plant, and equipment, other than land, from the time they are available for use on a straight-line basis by dividing the capital expenditure cost over the estimated useful life. The estimated useful life for the various categories of our property, plant, and equipment are as follows: Freehold buildings: 30 to 50 years Freehold improvements: 5 to 25 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment: 3 to 10 years Costs incurred in improving and/or expanding our studios are, therefore, capitalised and then depreciated in line with our policy. As we continue to invest in the improvement and expansion of our existing studios and facilities, costs associated with the depreciation of the corresponding capitalised costs will correspondingly increase. Software assets, capitalised as intangible assets, were put into use in May 2020 and amortised from that date. The useful life of these assets is 10 years.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Staff costs include salaries, social security costs, pension costs, compensation for loss of office, and other employee benefits. Our staff costs are affected by: - discretionary pay awards which are periodic salary increases and performance bonuses for our employees; - legislation governing employee pensions, in particular legislation governing the automatic enrolment of employees into a workplace pension; - changes in staff numbers and experience as our business needs and requirements change; - management restructuring and streamlining relating to changes in the management structure; and - activity-based staff requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

For the periods under review, certain of these costs could ----- be scaled back at times of low occupancy; however, there was a baseline level of facility costs required to operate our studios even at minimal occupancy rates. The Long-term Contracts encompass 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation at our Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios sites. Pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts, facility costs will continue to be borne by the Company, and we will be required to cover the costs of maintaining the state of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation to their standard at the commencement of the Long-term Contracts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.10,Lease Payment Structure,"Historically, we generally received payment for Stage and Other Production Accommodation partially in advance of customer occupation, and partially spread over the period of occupation of the studio. This payment in advance is recognised as turnover over the course of the lease and affects the timing of our cash flows. Since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation is subject to Long-term Contracts that provide for either quarterly or annual payments in advance and in full. Under the terms of the Long-term Contracts, if either Disney or Netflix (as the case may be) does not require part or all of their contracted space, they can ask us to find a third-party production to hire the space. We will attempt (but are under no obligation) to secure a replacement booking but full rental fees remain payable by Disney and/or Netflix to us under the Long-term Contracts. If we are able to re-sell stage space at or above the rate prescribed in the relevant Long-term Contract, the rent received under the Long-term Contract will be refunded and we are entitled to any overage or increase above the rate pursuant to the relevant Long-term Contract. Accordingly, we anticipate greater consistency in future periods with respect to turnover generated from our Stage and Other Production Accommodation. Historically, only a fraction of our stage space was subject to long-term contracts. For example, until October 2019, only approximately 25% of our UK stages were under long-term contracts, with the remainder under typical hire arrangements. Since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our UK Stage and Other Production Accommodation is now hired. As our space becomes subject to long-term contracts instead of typical hire arrangements, fluctuations in occupancy rates, volatility in turnover generated from Stage and Other Production Accommodation and variability in rental rate charges will decrease. Each of the Disney Long-term Contract and Netflix Long-term Contract provides for annual rental rate adjustments. The contracts have slight variations in the annual rent escalator, although both contracts refer to UK RPI to guide the escalator at each year or periodically through the contract term, with increases subject to a floor but without a cap on UK RPI. In accordance with FRS102, certain of the indexation provisions result in revenue over the term being recognised on a straight-line basis, rather than increasing each year. As a consequence, this revenue is adjusted upwards in the initial years of the contract compared with the contractual amounts due, and this uplift will reverse over the term of the contract. See “Business—Material Contracts.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.11,,"Our turnover is driven primarily by rental fees that we collect from renting out space under our Stage and Other Production Accommodation, Media Hub, and Television Studios business lines. The amount of rental fees we receive under these business lines is, in turn, driven primarily by the amount of space we have available to rent and the rental rates we charge our customers. Prior to entering into the Long-term Contracts, our turnover was also impacted by occupancy rates, however occupancy rates are of less relevance because 100% of our available Stage and Other Production Accommodation space is booked or otherwise occupied pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts. See “Business—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term Contract” and “Business—Material Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.” Our costs can be categorised as fixed costs, such as depreciation, variable costs, such as direct costs, and costs with both a fixed and a variable component, such as staff costs and facility costs. For the periods under review, the impact of variable costs on our results fluctuated based upon, among other factors, occupancy rates and our ability to pass along costs associated with any such fluctuations to our customers. However, since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts with Disney and Netflix, 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation at our Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios sites in the United Kingdom is occupied, mitigating the potential adverse impact of fluctuations in occupancy rates. In turn, with a greater level of stability in occupancy rates, we anticipate our variable costs will stabilise and such costs will be recovered pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts. However, there is no guarantee that unforeseen events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, will not adversely affect our occupancy rates, cost base or revenue. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating _to Our Business—We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including COVID- 19, which could adversely affect our business.”_ A portion of our costs are fixed and cannot be attributed to one business line or directly passed on to our customers.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our operations have not experienced significant disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, for the six months ended September 30, 2021, our turnover increased by £2.8 million or 6.1%, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2020, which we primarily attribute to operating levels of our localisation services within our Post Production business line and Ancillary Studio Services returning to normal, pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, where our customers have full production schedules resulting in our studios being busy. See —“Results of Operations—Turnover.” In addition, for the six months ended September 30, 2021, our cost of sales was £18.7 million, an increase of £1.2 million or 6.6%, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2020, which we primarily attribute to activity levels returning to normal, pre COVID-19 pandemic levels, an increase occupation of our Television Studios and energy costs which were charged under our Long-term Contracts at cost and a slight increase in maintenance costs incurred in connection with maintenance of our facilities.

In 2015, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire a 15% equity interest in PMBS and its wholly owned subsidiary Pinewood MBS Lighting Limited, a company that was subsequently granted an arrangement to provide lighting services at the Group’s UK facilities. The agreement included an option to step-up the Group’s equity interest in PMBS to 25% after five years for nil consideration. In December 2019, the option became exercisable and led to the reclassification of PMBS as an associate prospectively from that date, and the reversal of £1.7 million previously recognised fair value gains down to the original cost of nil.

This restructuring is expected to facilitate current and future commercial arrangements. Additionally, in February 2020, the Group received £2.8 million for the sale of its interest in POP Global Ltd. The investment was previously fully impaired and held at nil cost. After we discontinued picture services and our creative audio services business, our property, plant, and equipment associated with these business lines were assessed and impaired down to their realisable value, resulting in an impairment charge of £0.8 million. _Loss on Disposal of Participating Interests_ In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a loss on the disposal of £1.8 million was recognised on the sale of our equity investment in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, with the sale to our joint venture partner completing in August 2019. Proceeds net of costs amounted to £12.6 million and included earnout provisions linked to the financial performance of the studios for the year ended December 31, 2019. The sale proceeds included £0.6 million relating to earnout payments received in January 2020. _Gain on Loan to Participating Interests_ In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the step-up associated with the Group’s investment in PMBS was completed for nil consideration. The step-up resulted in the Group’s equity interest in PMBS increasing from 15% to 25%. In addition, PMBS issued additional loan notes to the Group. The additional loan notes were recognised initially on our balance sheet at fair value, estimated to be the face value, resulting in a corresponding gain in our income statement of £2.0 million. _Interest Payable and Similar Charges_ In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Group issued £550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, due September 2025, and entered into an amendment and restatement agreement to amend and restate the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Part of the proceeds from the issuance were used to fully redeem the Group’s existing £250.0 million 3.75% Senior Secured Notes, due 2023.

See “Business— _Material Contracts—Netflix Long-term Contract.” On August 23, 2019, we entered into a multi-year contract with_ Disney for 100% of Stage and Other Production Accommodation at Pinewood Studios, which commenced January 1, 2020. In the periods that followed, we reported all turnover generated under the Long-term Contracts under Stage and Other Production Accommodation. Accordingly, certain turnover reported under the Media Hub business line in prior periods shifted to Other Production Accommodation due to reallocation in connection with the Long-term Contracts pursuant to the demises. See “Business—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term _Contract.” On April 2, 2021, we entered into a long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million_ square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. The lease will commence on completion of the development, expected towards the end of 2023, and we expect our results of operations to be similarly impacted. ----- Historically, only a fraction of our stage space was subject to long-term contracts. For example, in September 2018, approximately 25% of our UK stages were under long-term contract and the remainder was under typical hire arrangements. Since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our UK Stage and Other Production Accommodation is now hired. As our space becomes subject to long-term contracts instead of typical hire arrangements, fluctuations in occupancy rates, volatility in turnover generated from Stage and Other Production Accommodation, and variability in rental rate charges will decrease. Each of the Disney Long-term Contract and Netflix Long-term Contract provides for annual rental rate adjustments. The contracts have slight variations in the annual rent escalator, although both contracts refer to UK RPI to guide the escalator at each year or periodically through the contract term, with increases subject to a floor but without a cap on UK RPI. In accordance with FRS102, certain of the indexation provisions result in revenue over the term being recognised on a straight-line basis, rather than increasing each year. As a consequence, this revenue is adjusted upwards in the initial years of the contract compared with the contractual amounts due, and this uplift will reverse over the term of the contract. See “Business—Material Contracts.” Payments for Stage and Other Production Accommodation under each Long-term Contract is made in advance of the relevant period, with the Long-term Contracts requiring payment in advance, either on a quarterly or annual basis. Historically, we generally received payment under Stage and Other Production Accommodation partially in advance of customer occupation and partially spread over the period of occupation of the studio. Accordingly, the Long-term Contracts result in a predictable distribution of payments for our Stage and Other Production Accommodation. In addition, we have implemented some operational efficiencies as an indirect effect of having entered into these Long-term Contracts. As a result of these changes, our results of operations may not be comparable to prior periods. Further, the results of operations since the start of the Long-term Contracts may not be comparable with future periods, should the unleased element of Shepperton South and Shepperton North West be let under typical hire agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Additionally, in 2021, we entered into a long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. The lease will commence on completion of the development, expected towards the end of 2023, and is on terms similar to the Netflix Long-term Contract. There is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton across both phases. In February 2019, we acquired Alderbourne Farm, an approximately 88-acre site adjacent to Pinewood Studios, and in August 2020, we acquired an approximately 77-acre site adjacent to Pinewood Studios which we refer to as Pinewood South, extending the Group’s total land holding in the United Kingdom to 502 acres and providing us with further opportunity to expand at a measured pace based on customer demand. In September 2020, we submitted an application for outline planning consent for the 77-acre site adjacent to Pinewood Studios. We expect to receive a decision from the local planning authority before January 2022. If successful, the planning application would give us the ability to build a global screen industries growth hub comprising: (i) additional production accommodation space; (ii) a visitor experience; (iii) an education hub; and (iv) a business growth hub. As we move forward with these expansion projects and any planned future expansion projects, there may be an increase in debt costs, initial start-up costs, and direct and indirect operating costs. See “Risk Factors—Risk _Relating to Our Business—We face completion risks, including competition from new market entrants and the expansion of new and existing studios.” In addition, there may be an increase in our revenue and Adjusted_ EBITDA. Our results of operations may not be comparable to prior periods should we pursue future expansion projects. For more information on our expansion projects, see “Summary—Our Key Strengths—Continue to ----- _Expand Our Footprint at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios.” There can be no guarantee that we will_ complete these projects as planned or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

In addition, we entered into a management services agreement, pursuant to which we were responsible for sales and marketing activity through our sales team, and in return, we were entitled to an annual sales, marketing, and licensing fee. On August 5, 2019, we completed the sale of our 40% equity in Pinewood Atlanta Studios; however, we continued to provide sales and marketing services until October 14, 2020 under a management services agreement and maintained a trademark license with Pinewood Forest (an entity owned by Pinewood Atlanta Studios). Pinewood Atlanta Studios ceased to be a Pinewood-branded studio on December 14, 2020 with the trademark license with Pinewood Forest being terminated at this time. Historically, fees earned under this management service contract were reflected in our Other Activities business line up to the point of termination of the management services agreement and, therefore, impact the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum. For more information, see Note 3 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Pinewood Group Limited as of, and for the fiscal years ended, March 31, 2020 and 2021 included elsewhere within this Offering Memorandum. _Pinewood Studios Wales Studio Management Services Agreement_ Pinewood Studios Wales Limited, a private limited company organised under the laws of England and Wales, provided marketing, operational, and management support services to Pinewood Studios Wales pursuant to a studio management services agreement. This agreement was terminated in March 2020, and we are no longer entitled to an annual sales and marketing fee. _Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studio Management Services Agreement_ Historically, we had an agreement to provide marketing, operational, and management support services to Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios. We terminated this agreement pursuant to a mutual agreement in July 2019 and, upon termination, we relinquished our negligible equity interest and are no longer entitled to an annual sales, marketing, and licensing fee.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.11,Description of Statement of Comprehensive Income Items,17.11.1,,"Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the continuing line items of our income statement. _Turnover_ Turnover is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the turnover can be reliably measured. Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, net of VAT and other sales taxes or duty. The Group has assessed its turnover arrangements and has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its turnover arrangements. Where a contract spans the accounting cut-off date, turnover is recognised as a proportion of the total value of the contract completed by the cut-off date, which is calculated either on the basis of time apportionment or according to the percentage of work completed. Our turnover is derived from our six business lines: (i) Stage and Other Production Accommodation; (ii) Media Hub; (iii) Television Studios; (iv) Ancillary Studio Services; (v) Post Production; and (vi) Other Activities. (i) Stage and Other Production Accommodation: Prior to the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, customers occupied Stage and Other Production Accommodation for a period of time. Turnover was recognised as the Group earned the right to consideration for the service provided, and this was time apportioned and earned as time elapsed. For periods following the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, turnover from Stage and Other Production Accommodation has been largely derived pursuant to the Long-term Contracts payable in advance either quarterly or annually, and includes Stage and Other Production Accommodation, ----- and incorporates some of the former Media Hub space at both Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. (ii) Media Hub: Media Hub turnover comprises rental income from the Group’s properties. Prior to February 2020, Media Hub turnover also included service charge income which covered cleaning, security, energy, and maintenance, which has been phased out with the introduction of higher gross rents. The Media Hub facilities include office space, workshops, archive storage and support premises. Customers contract to utilise the Group’s Media Hub facilities for a set period of time. Turnover is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Where there are rent-free arrangements within an agreement, the turnover is time apportioned over the term from the commencement date of the agreement to the end of the term. Where an agreement spans an accounting cut-off date, turnover is recognised on a straight-line basis over the agreement term completed by the cut-off date. Turnover generated from Media Hub has declined slightly, as turnover earned from some space originally occupied by Media Hub tenants has been included in the demise to Disney and Netflix under the Long-term Contracts. (iii) Television Studios: Turnover is generated from the provision of the Group’s three fully serviced dedicated Television Studios at Pinewood Studios. The Group renders under contract the dedicated digital Television Studios on a fully serviced basis, including, when requested, contractors, lighting, cameras, technical equipment, dressing rooms, and production offices, all of which are priced into the contract in accordance with the customer needs. Turnover is recognised as the Group earns the right to consideration for the service provided, time apportioned in relation to the television production process. (iv) Ancillary Studio Services: For the periods under review excluding the Long-term Contracts, customers consumed utilities and were recharged the cost of the utility, based on actual consumption, plus a margin. For periods since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, utilities are charged at cost pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts. In addition, we have revenue share agreements with partners who provide Ancillary Studio Services, where fees are recognised as the services are provided. (v) Post Production: Customers occupy audio mixing and recording theatres for a period of time, and may also be provided with sound mixing or mix technicians within the hire charge. Turnover is recognised as the Group earns the right to consideration for the service provided, which is time apportioned for mixing theatres hired or recognised on a stage of completion basis for work packages involving experienced staff. In August 2019, we announced that the picture services business was being discontinued, and, in March 2020, we announced that the creative audio services business was being discontinued. Accordingly, we experienced a decline in consolidated turnover; however, we did not experience a significant change to the remaining turnover from our localisation business pursuant to the Long-term Contracts. (vi) Other Activities: We earn sales and marketing fees primarily from International Sales and Marketing. Such fees are time apportioned. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales consist of direct cost of sales, which can be allocated to our six business lines, and indirect cost of sales, which are costs attributable to the total Media Services segment, but cannot be directly apportioned against individual business lines. Direct cost of sales are comprised of purchase price of utilities, hire of equipment and facilities, and purchase of consumables that, for the periods under review, were all sold at cost plus a margin, staff costs relating to staff directly deployed in activity relating to the turnover lines, and other costs incurred in generating the turnover. Since the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, utilities are charged at cost pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts. Indirect cost of sales are comprised of site maintenance costs, rent for temporary accommodation, and business rates, health and safety, security and cleaning costs, insurance, depreciation relating to equipment and facilities directly deployed in the turnover lines, and depreciation of facilities. ----- _Selling and Distribution Costs_ Selling and distribution costs consist primarily of staff costs related to our sales and marketing team, sales and marketing expenses, trade fairs, and publicity costs. _Administrative Expenses_ Administrative expenses consist primarily of staff costs related to our finance and corporate teams, professional fees, corporate costs, audit fees, information technology costs, human resources and training costs and amortisation of software and goodwill. Administrative expenses also include any changes in the valuation of our investment in Pinewood MBS for the periods to December 31, 2019, when the investment was de-recognised as a financial instrument held at fair value and recognised at cost of nil, with the subsequent charge reflected in administrative expenses/(income) adjusted items. _Income/(Loss) from Participating Interests_ Income from participating interests consists of our share of the results of joint ventures and associates. The Group accounts for participating interests under the equity method of accounting. In August 2019, we completed the sale of our 40% interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios. For more information, see “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Future Results of Operations—Exit from Joint _Ventures and Third-Party Studio Licenses—Pinewood Atlanta Studios Joint Venture and Management Services Agreement.”_ With effect from December 2019, as a result of the step-up in the Group’s investment, we recognise our equity share of the results of PMBS. For discussion of the agreement in relation to our equity holdings in PMBS, see “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Future Results of Operations—Exit from Joint Ventures and Third_Party Studio Licenses—_ _Classification of Investment in PMBS Holding Limited.” _Interest Receivable and Similar Income_ Interest receivable and similar income consists of interest receivable from the loan made by the Group to its parent company, Picture Holdco Limited, other interest receivable on other bank accounts, and investments, other loan notes receivable, and fair value gains associated with the Group’s derivative financial instruments. _Interest Payable and Similar Expenses_ Interest payable and similar expenses consists of payments under our borrowing arrangements, including our interest rate swap agreements, together with fair value losses associated with the Group’s derivative financial instruments. _Tax Charge_ Tax charge consists of the sum of current tax (comprising UK corporation tax charge, amounts payable for Group tax loss relief, foreign corporation tax, foreign tax suffered, double taxation credit, and amounts (under)/overprovided in previous years), UK Film Tax Relief and deferred tax (comprising tax recognised in respect of timing differences between the recognition of trading results within the tax assessments and their recognition in the statement of comprehensive income, the reversal of tax recognised when the timing differences unwind, effect of change in deferred tax rates, and amounts over/(under) provided in previous years). _Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)_ Other comprehensive income consists of exchange differences on translation of operations whose functional currency is not pound sterling into pound sterling as a presentational currency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

We attribute this primarily to activity levels returning to normal, pre COVID-19 pandemic levels (with increased TV and energy costs supporting the increase in revenue) and a slight increase in maintenance costs incurred in connection with maintenance of our facilities. _Selling and Distribution Costs & Administrative Expenses_ Selling and distribution costs and administrative expenses in the six months ended September 30, 2021 were £4.2 million compared to £4.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of £0.2 million, or 4.8%, which we attribute primarily to staff costs associated with our studio expansion plans and higher amortisation of software, partially offset by a decrease in costs due to running fewer events or postponing events until a later period and a decrease in staff headcount in other teams that occurred during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses in the six months ended September 30, 2021 were £0.5 million compared to £1.2 million in the six months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of £0.7 million or 58.3%, which we primarily attribute to the loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment net of funds granted by the UK government under their Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme in the six months ended September 30, 2020, whereas in the six months ended September 30, 2021 we voluntarily returned a net £0.5 million of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme grants received throughout the prior financial year in relation to our retained staff. ----- _Gain on Loan to Participating Interests_ Gain on loan to participating interests in the six months ended September 30, 2021 was nil compared to £2.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of £2.0 million or 100%. This decrease is due to the fact that the PMBS loan notes, which were recognised on our balance sheet in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 at fair value, estimated to be the face value, resulting in a corresponding gain in our income statement of £2.0 million, remains unchanged for the six months ended September 30, 2021. _Income from Participating Interests_ Income from participating interests in the six months ended September 30, 2021 was £1.0 million compared to income from participating interests in the six months ended September 30, 2020 of nil, an increase of £1.0 million or 100%, which we attribute primarily to our associate company, PMBS, benefitting from activity levels across the film and HETV production industry returning to normal, pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. For discussion of the agreement in relation to our equity holdings in PMBS, see “—Key Factors Affecting _Comparability of Future Results of Operations—Exit from Joint Ventures and Third-Party Studio Licenses— Classification of Investment in PMBS Holding Limited.” Interest Receivable and Similar Income_ Interest receivable and similar income in the six months ended September 30, 2021 was £6.1 million compared to £5.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of £0.3 million or 5.1%. We attribute this slight improvement to the fair value gain on the Group’s derivative financial instruments and the receipt of other interest income. _Interest Payable and Similar Charges_ Interest payable and similar charges in the six months ended September 30, 2021 were £12.7 million compared to £10.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of £2.3 million, or 22.3%, which we attribute primarily to an increase in principal by £200.0 million our senior secured notes following the 2025 Notes Tap Issuance in January 2021. _Tax on Profit_ Tax on profit in the six months ended September 30, 2021 was £5.3 million compared to £5.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of £0.2 million, or 5.0%, which we attribute primarily to an increase in the main rate of UK corporation tax, from 19% to 25%, from 1 April 2023, which has been incorporated into our deferred tax position, partially offset by the six months ended September 30, 2020 including a tax charge of £0.5 million in relation to the gain on loan to participating interests and a small adjustment to the tax estimated on the sale of the group’s equity interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios. _Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)_ Other comprehensive income in the six months ended September 30, 2021 was £0.1 million compared to a loss of £0.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of £0.2 million, comprised of exchange differences on translation of foreign operations into pound sterling as a presentational currency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

This was partially offset by a decrease in revenues primarily due to the cessation of picture services and creative audio services, exiting our agreements with studios in Malaysia, Wales, and Atlanta, and a decrease in turnover in Post Production, Television Studios and Ancillary Studio Services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Long-term Contracts contain indexation provisions, which, in accordance with FRS102, result in certain revenue over the initial term being recognised on a straight-line basis, rather than increasing each year. As a consequence, revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 is adjusted upwards by £3.0 million and £1.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2020, compared with the contractual amounts due in the respective year. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were £36.4 million compared to £40.4 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of £4.0 million, or 9.7%, which we attribute primarily to savings in our Post Production business line as picture services and creative audio operations closed, a lower level of maintenance expense at our studios as a result of a production hiatus during the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and moderate cost control measures we implemented throughout the year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Selling and Distribution Costs_ Selling and distribution costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were £0.9 million compared to £1.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of £0.7 million or 44.2%. We attribute this decrease primarily to a decrease in expenditures on international events and travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and streamlined business processes. _Administrative Expenses_ Administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were £7.0 million compared to £8.2 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of £1.2 million, or 14.1%, which we attribute primarily to a £1.9 million improvement in administrative expenses/(income) adjusted items, partially offset by a small investment in the teams delivering our studio expansion programmes and the commencement of amortisation of our new IT platform. Administrative expenses/(income) adjusted items in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were a £0.5 million gain compared to a £1.4 million net charge in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, an improvement by £1.9 million. Following the termination of the sales and marketing services we provided in connection with Pinewood Atlanta Studios on October 14, 2020, £0.5 million of unamortised deferred trademark royalties in connection with Pinewood Forest, originally recognised on balance sheet in 2016, were released to the income statement. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we charged £1.7 million to our income statement due to the derecognition of our 15% equity holding in Pinewood MBS which had been carried as a financial instrument at ----- fair value until December 31, 2019 and £0.4 million of restructuring expenditures was incurred, partially offset by a £0.7 million receipt of monies in relation to the early termination of our Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios agreement. For more information on adjustments to administrative expenses, see “Presentation of Financial _Information—_ _Other Financial Information (Non-UK GAAP).” Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were £2.4 million compared to £0.6 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of £1.8 million, which we attribute primarily to a loss on disposal of property at Pinewood Studios following the clearance of three areas in advance of the construction of five new stages, to be occupied by Disney in accordance with the Disney Long-term Contract and advisory fees in relation to a minor acquisition which, subsequently, was not pursued. This was partially offset by the £0.7 million of receipts under the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme during the year ended March 31, 2021, but subsequently largely returned during the six months ended September 30, 2021 after the group’s positive financial performance. The prior year reflected adjusted items totalling £0.6 million in respect of a £0.8 million impairment of Post Production fixed assets following the closure of picture services and creative audio services, a £2.8 million receipt from the sale of our investment in POP Global Ltd, which had previously been fully impaired, and a oneoff stamp duty land tax payment of £2.6 million. Since the acquisition of Shepperton from the joint venture partners in December 2014, a complex corporate structure had been in place around the subsidiary ownership of the studio. The structure was simplified in advance of the commencement of the Netflix Long-term Contract, thereby reducing future costs. _Loss on Disposal of Participating Interests_ Loss on disposal of participating interests in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was nil compared to £1.8 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of £1.8 million, which we attribute to the sale of our 40% equity investment in Pinewood Atlanta Studios that completed in August 2019. The £1.8 million loss on disposal of the equity investment in Pinewood Atlanta Studios included proceeds, net of costs, totalling £12.6 million.

The step-up resulted in the Group’s equity interest in PMBS increasing from 15% to 25%. In addition, PMBS issued additional loan notes to the Group. The impact of the additional loan notes was recognised on our balance sheet at fair value, estimated to be the face value, resulting in a corresponding gain in our income statement of £2.0 million. _Income from Participating Interests_ Income from participating interests in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was nil compared to £0.1 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a decrease which we attribute to the sale of the Group’s equity investment in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, completing in August 2019. For more information on Pinewood Atlanta Studios, see “Business—Our Business Lines—Other Activities—International Sales and Marketing.” _Interest Receivable and Similar Income_ Interest receivable and similar income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was £11.5 million compared to £8.6 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of £2.9 million, or 33.8%, which we attribute to interest earned on the loan to Picture Holdco Limited, our parent company, which was originally created in December 2017, and which increased by £175.0 million following our 2019 Refinancing Transaction which closed on September 25, 2019. We also benefitted from higher interest income on the additional £2.0 million of loan notes from PMBS. ----- _Interest Payable and Similar Charges_ Interest payable and similar charges in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were £20.6 million compared to £28.1 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of £7.5 million, or 26.8%, which we attribute primarily to the non-repeat of £11.8 million of interest payable adjusted items in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 in connection with the 2019 Refinancing Transaction which closed on September 25, 2019, a smaller charge in relation to the value of our “out-of-the-money” derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps used to hedge against risks associated with interest rate fluctuation), partially offset by an increase in interest payable on our senior secured notes in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 following the 2019 Refinancing Transaction and 2025 Tap Notes Issuance. _Tax Charge_ Tax charged in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was £9.3 million compared to £5.9 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of £3.4 million, or 56.2%. Tax charged on profit before tax was higher in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 due in part to higher profit before tax, and because costs in relation to certain advisory fees and losses on disposal of assets were disallowed for tax purposes, while the year ended March 31, 2020 benefitted from a change in legislation in the USA to allow losses generated in 2018 to be carried back against earlier profitable periods. Tax charged on adjusted items was £2.3 million higher as adjusted items before tax totalled a £2.6 million profit in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 compared to a loss of £15.7 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 See “—Factors Affecting Comparability—Adjusted Items,” with certain corporate and financial restructuring commencing during in the year ended March 31, 2020 and completing in the year ended March 31, 2021. _Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)_ Other comprehensive income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was a loss of £0.5 million compared to a £0.5 million gain in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, an increased loss of £1.0 million, comprised of exchange differences on translation of foreign operations into pound sterling as a presentational currency. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

This was partially offset by lower revenues in Post Production due to the cessation of picture services and creative audio services, and lower revenues from the management arrangements with Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and the Studios in Wales. Additionally, the Long-term Contracts contain indexation provisions, which, in accordance with FRS102, result in certain revenue over the initial term being recognised on a straight-line basis, rather than increasing each year. As a consequence, revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 is adjusted upwards by £1.4 million compared with the contractual amounts due for that year. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were £40.4 million compared to £41.0 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of £0.6 million, or 1.4%, which we attribute primarily to savings in our Post Production business line, as contracted picture services and creative audio work was completed and the operations closed, a non-recurrence of a £0.9 million prior year loss on the demolition and disposal of certain assets affected by the real estate optimisation programme, partially offset by higher depreciation, business rates, and facilities costs following the opening of Pinewood East Phase 2 in autumn 2019, together with the return of energy costs to typical levels following an energy refund in the prior year. _Selling and Distribution Costs_ Selling and distribution costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were £1.6 million compared to £1.7 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of £0.1 million, or 8.3%. _Administrative Expenses_ Administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were £8.2 million compared to £8.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of £0.1 million, or 0.8%, which we attribute 79 ----- primarily to a £0.6 million, or 64.3%, increase in adjusted items from a charge of £0.9 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 to a charge of £1.4 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The £1.4 million net charge in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 increased from the £0.9 million charge in the prior year due to a £1.7 million charge from the derecognition of our 15% equity holding in Pinewood MBS which had been carried as a financial instrument at fair value until December 31, 2019, partially offset by lower restructuring costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and a £0.7 million receipt of monies in relation to the early termination of the management contract with Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were £0.6 million compared to nil in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, an increase of £0.6 million, which we attribute primarily to adjusted items in respect of a £0.8 million impairment of post-production fixed assets following the closure of picture services and creative audio services, a £2.8 million receipt from the sale of our investment in POP Global Ltd, which had previously been fully impaired, and a one-off stamp duty land tax payment of £2.6 million. Since the acquisition of Shepperton from the joint venture partners in December 2014, a complex corporate structure had been in place around the subsidiary ownership of the studio. The structure was simplified in advance of the commencement of the Netflix Long-term Contract, thereby reducing future costs. _Loss on Disposal of Participating Interests_ Loss on disposal of participating interests in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was £1.8 million compared to a loss on disposal of participating interests in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 of nil, an increase of £1.8 million, which we attribute primarily to the sale of our 40% interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, which is recognised net of a performance related earnout income of £0.5 million, which was received in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.

For more information, see “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Future Results of Operations—Exit from Joint _Ventures and Third-Party Studio Licenses—Pinewood Atlanta Studios Joint Venture and Management Services Agreement”. Interest Receivable and Similar Income_ Interest receivable and similar income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was £8.6 million compared to £5.7 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, an increase of £2.9 million, or 51.0%, which we attribute to interest earned on the loan to the Group’s parent company, which was originally created in December 2017, and increased by £175.0 million following the Group’s refinancing on September 25, 2019. _Interest Payable and Similar Charges_ Interest payable and similar charges in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were £28.1 million compared to £11.9 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, an increase of £16.2 million, or 136.9%, which we primarily attribute to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 reflecting a charge of £11.8 million in connection with the extinguishment of the prior loan notes and facilities at the time of the Group’s refinancing on September 25, 2019, and higher interest payable following the increase in the principal amount of senior secured notes. _Tax Charge_ Tax charge in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was a charge of £5.9 million compared to a charge of £6.1 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of £0.2 million, or 2.0%, which we attribute ----- primarily to a £0.6 million lower tax charge at the standard rate of corporation tax on profit before tax and lower unrelieved tax losses of £0.5 million, offset by £0.9 million increase in tax on gain on disposal of joint venture. _Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)_ Other comprehensive income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was £0.5 million compared to £0.8 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, a decrease of £0.3 million, or 33.3%, comprised of exchange differences on translation of foreign operations into pound sterling as a presentational currency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The increase was attributable to a higher reduction in working capital of £8.1 million compared the prior period, driven by: (i) a higher unwind of deferred income balances as more cash was paid in advance of the six months ended September 30, 2021 than in advance of the six months ended September 30, 2020; (ii) a natural delay in the timing of VAT reclaims relating to capital expenditure as our studio expansion plans progress; and (iii) partially offset by a reduced level of resale-related payments during this period. Our net cash flow from operating activities decreased by £12.0 million, or 27.0%, from £44.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 to £32.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was attributable to a variety of factors, including: (i) a £7.6 million improvement in operating cash flows before movements in working capital to £63.2 million due to improved trading results (but excluding the non-cash impacts relating to depreciation and amortisation, the loss on disposal of fixed assets in relation to the clearance of three areas of the Pinewood site in advance of the development of our five new stages, the impact of the fair value gain and losses on the PMBS investment, a gain on the sale of our investment in POP Global Ltd, and a loss on the disposal of our share of the Pinewood Atlanta studios for the fiscal year end March 31, 2020); (ii) a £20.4 million reduced benefit from working capital due a higher unwind of deferred income balances as, due to the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, more cash was paid in advance of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 than in advance of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, higher resale cash settlements, a higher level of payments in respect of VAT, and the recognition of profit, which had been previously deferred, following the termination of our management service contract with Pinewood Atlanta Studios; (iii) a decreased interest payment of £1.2 million as a result of the 2019 Refinancing Transaction and 2025 Tap Notes Issuance. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as a result of the 2019 Refinancing Transaction we made a make-whole payment of £5.9 million plus 15 months of interest payments for the senior secured notes that we redeemed. In the fiscal year ----- ended March 31, 2021, interest payments on our 2025 Notes increased due to an increase in principal following the 2025 Notes Tap Issuance in January 2021; and (iv) an increase of £0.4 million in our payment of net taxes with a higher level of disallowed costs in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, and payments in connection with transitioning to HMRC’s new schedule of payments in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, partially offset by lower net income tax payments in relation to both a tax refunds in the US and a film production company which is now inactive. Our net cash flow from operating activities increased £4.7 million, or 11.9%, from £39.6 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 to £44.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We attribute this increase primarily to improved cash flows before movements in working capital of £10.4 million, mainly due to the trading results described previously, an £11.0 million net improvement in working capital with both Longterm Contracts being paid in advance, which was offset by unwindings of working capital on amounts which had been paid in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 in respect of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, offset by a £14.0 million increase in net interest paid due to the refinancing of the senior secured notes on September 25, 2019, and higher tax paid of £2.7 million following the start of the revised HMRC payment schedule for UK companies, which resulted in additional scheduled payments during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 which was the transition period year. _Net Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities_ Our net cash flow used in investing activities increased £22.9 million, or 175.7%, from £13.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2020 to £35.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2021. We attribute this increase primarily to increased expenditure related to the continued development of the five stages at Pinewood West, enabling works at Shepperton North West, and the design and enabling works in connection with expansion at Shepperton South. Our net cash flow used in investing activities declined by £177.6 million, or 84.9%, from £209.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 to £31.7 million in the fiscal year ended March 30, 2021. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 were higher than in fiscal year ended March 30, 2021 primarily due to capital expenditures related to the development of Pinewood East Phase 2, which resulted in the Company lending £175.0 million of cash from the 2019 Refinancing Transaction to our Parent, partially offset by the receipt of £12.6 million from the sale of equity in Pinewood Atlanta Studios and £2.8 million from the sale of equity in POP Global Ltd. In addition, the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 included increased expenditure related to the development of five new stages at Pinewood West and the acquisition of land to the south of Pinewood. Our net cash flow used in investing activities increased £167.2 million, or 397.1%, from £42.1 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 to £209.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We attribute this primarily to a £175.0 million increase in the loan to the Group’s parent company as a part of the refinancing on September 25, 2019, a £10.5 million net increase in amounts spent in relation to property plant and equipment and intangible assets mainly from the continued development of Pinewood East Phase 2, partially offset by a receipt of £12.6 million for the sale of our share in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, which had resulted in losses due to low occupancy in the previous year and £2.8 million from the sale of the investment in POP Global Ltd, and the non-repeat of a £2.9 million investment into Pinewood Atlanta Studios in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. _Net Cash Flow from/(Used in) Financing Activities_ In the six months ended September 30, 2021, our net cash flow used in financing activities was £0.1 compared to nil in the six months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of £0.1 million, which we attribute primarily to payment of residual financing arrangement fees during this period. Our net cash flow from financing activities decreased £13.7 million, or 6.3%, from £218.3 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 to £204.6 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 reflects the net receipts of funds, after arrangement fees, from the 2025 Notes Tap Issuance. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 primarily reflected cash movements from the 2019 Refinancing Transaction, with a net increase of £300.0 million senior secured notes, of which we paid £75.0 million as a dividend to the Parent and £6.5 million in arrangement fees. Our net cash flow from financing activities increased £218.9 million from £0.6 million of net cash flow used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 to £218.3 million of net cash flow from financing activities in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We attribute the increase primarily to the refinancing ----- on September 25, 2019, and the net receipt of £300.0 million from the net increase in senior secured notes, of which we paid £75.0 million as a dividend to the Parent and £6.5 million in arrangement fees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, net of discounts, rebates, VAT, and other sales taxes or duty. The Group has assessed its turnover arrangements and has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its turnover arrangements. Where a contract spans an accounting cut-off date, the value of the turnover recognised is the proportion of the total value of the contract completed by the cut-off date. The following specific recognition criteria apply for turnover generated from the Group’s single reportable segment: - Film customers utilise services for a period of time. Turnover is recognised as the Group earns the right to consideration for the service provided and this is time apportioned and earned as time elapses. - Film turnover is also derived from international sales and marketing agreements, and certain consultancy agreements. Revenue is recognised based on the passage of time for the former and on a stage of completion basis by reference to costs incurred for the latter. - Television turnover is derived from the provision of services and is recognised on a time apportioned basis in relation to the television production process. - Media Hub turnover is derived from customers contracting to use the Group’s facilities for a period of time.

Depreciation is calculated on all property, plant, and equipment, other than land, from the time they are available for use on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life as follows: - Freehold buildings: 30 to 50 years - Freehold improvements: 5 to 25 years - Fixtures, fittings and equipment: 3 to 10 years ----- Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The carrying value of freehold land and buildings within “Property, plant and equipment” in the statement of financial position is based on external valuations undertaken by an independent firm of Chartered Surveyors in February 2000 (as amended in January 2001) and November 2000, on each occasion, to establish the fair values of the Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios businesses acquired. Subsequent to these valuations, the cost to the Group of freehold land and buildings, additions, disposals, and depreciation have been recorded in line with Group accounting policies. The carrying value of property, plant, and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and is written-down immediately to the recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and, where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively. An item of property, plant, and equipment is derecognised upon disposal.

The amount capitalised is the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term, both determined at inception of the lease. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. All other leases are operating leases and the annual rent is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Adjusted items are transactions that are unusual in size or nature, or have ----- limited predictive value such as disposals, discontinued operations, impairments, certain fair value remeasurements, and other significant items. The identification and presentation of transactions as adjusted items requires judgement. _Recoverability of Trade and Other Receivables_ The recoverability of financial assets, including trade and other receivables, requires judgement. The Group regularly reviews financial assets for evidence of impairment. _Classification of Investment in PMBS Holding Limited_ In 2015, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire a 15% equity interest in PMBS and its wholly owned subsidiary Pinewood MBS Lighting Limited, a company that was subsequently granted an arrangement to provide lighting services at the Group's UK facilities. The agreement included an option to step up the Group’s equity interest in PMBS to 25% after five years for nil consideration. In December 2019, the option became exercisable and the majority investor in PMBS served notice to defer a number of its ordinary shares in PMBS sufficient to increase the Group’s interest to 25%. The re-designation of these deferred shares was automatic and did not require shareholder approval or resolution. As at December 31, 2019, the Group deemed that the holding of an exercisable option to step-up the equity in PMBS gave the Group an effective interest in PMBS of 25% and, after reviewing all the facts and circumstances, considered the Group had significant influence over the entity. Accordingly, PMBS was classified as an associate prospectively from December 31, 2019. As at March 31, 2020, PMBS had not yet served the required notices to confirm the re-designation of deferred shares, nor issued the new share certificates and therefore the Group’s legal interest in PMBS remained at 15% at the balance sheet date. Prior to December 31, 2019, the initial 15% equity interest in PMBS was classified as a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented within Other investments. Following the classification of PMBS to an associate, the financial asset was de-recognised, re-recognised as an interest in associate and measured at the original cost of the investment in accordance with FRS 102. The total equity interest in PMBS was acquired at nil cost to the Group. Accordingly, the recognition of the investment as an associate required the cumulative unrealised fair value gains booked in prior years to be reversed. In addition, the Group reclassified its investment in PMBS loan notes from Trade and other receivables to Interests in associates. In June 2020, PMBS made the required notices to confirm the re-designation of deferred shares and legally increase the Group’s interest in the associate to 25%. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the step-up associated with the Group’s investment in PMBS was completed for nil consideration. In addition, PMBS issued additional loan notes to the Group. The impact of the fair value gain/loss of the additional loan notes was recognised on our balance sheet for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, estimated to be the face value, resulting in a corresponding gain in our income statement of £2.0 million.

The growth has been driven mainly by streamers, including Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu, which collectively accounted for 42% of total content production spend by key players in 2021, up from only 10% in 2015. For OTT platforms, the breadth and exclusivity of content, in particular original content, is a key differentiating factor and driver of subscriber acquisition and retention. Netflix and Amazon have both produced a large number of original films and television series, with many receiving awards and critical acclaim. Academy Award winning films include Extraction by Netflix and Manchester by the Sea by Amazon. Popular series include _The Queen’s Gambit, You, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Man in the High Castle, Tiger King,_ _Stranger Things_ and many others. Their content spending has increased as they have invested in an increasing number of offerings as well as in higher end productions such as _The Crown, which has estimated production costs between $6.5 million and $13 million per episode. To support their streaming platforms, Disney and Apple are increasing their investment in original content production, for both their streaming platforms and traditional distribution. For example, Disney is expecting their content expense to exceed $8.0 billion by 2024, more than double the $4.0 billion originally estimated in April 2019. Warner Media has announced that in 2021, it will premiere 17 movies simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max in the United States. We believe that this combination of rapidly growing spend on content by existing OTT platforms, the launch of new OTT platforms by traditional media companies, and the competitive response of television broadcasters will continue to drive growth in film and television production spend and therefore demand for film and television content production facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.1,Global Film and OTT Production Industry,521.1.2,,"Demand for film and High-end TV continues to increase, driven by rising consumer expectations for higher quality content, including sophisticated visual effects, growing media consumption in emerging markets and increased accessibility to online media via tablets and smartphones. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to global cinema operations across the world to a varying degree including film releases being postponed, cinemas and movie theatres being closed, and festivals being cancelled. In the UK, productions went on a hiatus during the first national lockdown, however filming resumed over the summer. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to an increase in the consumption of high quality content through OTT platforms. The five fastest growing streaming platforms by subscriber growth for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 were Apple TV+, HBO Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Netflix, and collectively gained 163 million new subscribers over the period, reflecting an increase of 36% since September 30, 2020. Current large operators Netflix and Amazon launched their streaming services in 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, Netflix had 222 million global streaming paid memberships, an increase of 27 million from September 30, 2020, and Amazon Prime had 145 million paid subscribers, reflecting an increase of 26 million from September 30, 2020, according to Ampere Analysis. Furthermore, Apple launched their own streaming service Apple TV+ in November 2019, and as of September 30, 2021 had 88 million subscribers, reflecting an increase of 39 million subscribers compared to September 30, 2020. In response to the competition from Netflix, Amazon and Apple, traditional production companies have also announced their own streaming platforms. For example, Disney launched Disney+, its own direct-toconsumer streaming platform in 2019, and had 10 million subscribers on the first day. As of September 30, 2021, Disney+ had 87 million subscribers, an increase of 31 million subscribers compared to September 30, 2020, and is targeting between 230 and 260 million subscribers by 2024, including 30-40% from Hotstar, the Disney+ platform in India. Disney+ and Netflix together accounted for 46% of subscribers across key streaming platforms. Warner Media (owned by AT&T), launched HBO Max, which had 69 million HBO Max activations as of September 30, 2021.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.2,Facilities for Content Production,521.2.1,,"Facilities with a track record of hosting high-end content productions (“premium facilities”) share a number of characteristics. Most importantly, these facilities are located in close proximity to a highly skilled work force that can staff thousands of highly specialised crew members required for production. Although it is possible to move crew members for the duration of a production, doing so greatly increases complexity and operational risk. As a result, premium facilities that host these productions can benefit from the presence of multiple related businesses on or near their facility (through, for example, our Media Hub model). Additionally, these premium facilities are often located in attractive areas for directors and actors to reside in for the relatively long duration of a production. Importantly, such facilities must offer extensive physical infrastructure, including a range of stage sizes, special stages (for example, underwater stages), ample backlots and ancillary spaces such as workshops and offices. Finally, such facilities must offer comprehensive security, given the special concerns in film production around privacy, confidentiality and business continuity. Facilities that exhibit all of these features create an “ecosystem” that foster on-time, on-budget production. ----- Major production companies that are active in content production use both owned sites and hired independent facilities. A limited number of facilities exist globally with the right blockbuster film production “ecosystem,” and independent facilities with such features are highly attractive for the major film production companies. This is particularly true when a major film production company has filmed successful content at a particular location, when its owned sites are filled to capacity or when productions require special stages. Although the major film production companies are repeat users of independent facilities, they are unlikely to invest in acquiring independent facilities or building their own sites, as they view themselves as investors in content rather than real estate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.4,The United Kingdom as a Global Production Hub,521.4.2,,"The United Kingdom’s success in the creative industries is driven by a wide range of specialist subsectors, creating a rich, cross-disciplinary environment for collaboration and innovation. The creative industries are defined by DCMS to include film and television production, software services, music, the performing arts, advertising and marketing, publishing and design. Employment in the creative industries grew at a CAGR of 4% between 2011 and 2021. In 2021, the creative industries employed over two million people, or about 7% of the United Kingdom’s work force. Within the United Kingdom, creative industries, film, and video production constitutes an important driver of employment, economic output and exports. In recent years, the United Kingdom has benefited from increase in production spend. According to BFI, production spend on UK feature films and High-end TV increased ----- at a CAGR of 15% between 2017 and 2021. Inward investments continue to drive the overall spending with bigger budget films taking space in the United Kingdom. The below table illustrates the total production spend in the UK on UK feature films and High-end TV over the last five years. According to the Office for National Statistics, as of 2020 there were approximately 65,967 film and video production workers in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 66% based in London and South East England, which is a draw for major film production companies seeking a location to produce blockbuster films or High-end TV. The production sector workforce has increased by approximately 78% since 2010, at a CAGR of approximately 6%. The production sector workforce has increased by 3% since 2017, at a CAGR of approximately 1%. The production sector workforce has increased by 57% since 2011, at a CAGR of approximately 6%. Blockbuster films and High-end TV require a wide range of highly specialised skills, such as camera operation, lighting and make up, and the United Kingdom has developed such a specialised workforce over the past decades to cater to such needs. The United Kingdom is among few global locations in which a production crew can be recruited entirely locally, without the need to fly in crew from other film centres. This reduces operational risk and complexity for producers, and enhances the United Kingdom’s attractiveness for blockbuster films and Highend TV. Another key attraction for major film production companies is the United Kingdom’s stable legal and regulatory framework. In particular, the United Kingdom has a long history of fostering the development of the film sector through tax incentives. Certain tax credits were introduced in 1992, and subsequently updated and extended by a series of governments in 1997, 2007 and 2015. Under current rules, film producers receive a cash rebate of 25% on the lower of (i) 80% of total core production expenditure, or (ii) 100% of total UK expenditure. Tax incentives for the film sector enjoy broad cross-party support, with politicians from all three major parties regularly citing film as a valuable contributor to the UK economy. UK tax incentives provide a tested and reliable framework for film producers allocating their production spend. It is important to note, however, that tax incentives for the film sector exist across many jurisdictions, including the US states (such as California, New York, Georgia and Louisiana), Canadian provinces (such as British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec), other European countries (including France, Germany and the Netherlands) as well as Australia and New Zealand. A more recent factor contributing to the United Kingdom’s attractiveness to major film production companies is the impact of the pound sterling’s devaluation following the vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in June 2016, which reduced the relative cost of United Kingdom workers and facilities to global film production companies, whose budgets are usually set in US dollar. Within the United Kingdom, the area in close proximity to London accounts for the vast majority of film and television production. In 2020, London and the South East accounted for 71% of enterprises in the United Kingdom active in film and television production and post production activities. Despite London’s importance to the film sector, the ability to build new film production facilities is constrained by the scarcity of available land, the difficulty of obtaining planning permission and multiple high value alternative uses. As a consequence of London’s population growth and economic success, the competition for land for a variety of residential, commercial, social and community uses has intensified. Tracts of land ----- sufficiently large enough to build a large scale film production facility are rarely available near London. New film production facilities in the London area are often planned on smaller tracts of land, with less room for expansion.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.5,BUSINESS Overview,521.5.1,Our Business Lines,"Our operations comprise the following six business lines, each of which falls within three broader categories, and as such, we present them throughout this Offering Memorandum in this manner: - rental activities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, comprising Stage and Other Production Accommodation, Media Hub and Television Studios; - ancillary activities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, comprising Post Production and Ancillary Studio Services; and - other activities, primarily consisting of International Sales and Marketing. Rental activities are by far the largest contributor to our business, accounting for 92.6% of Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Rental activities typically include income generated by the use of stages, workshops, offices, and TV studios. ----- Demand for our ancillary activities, accounting for 6.0% of Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, is driven in part by demand for our rental activities. These activities typically include post production services, recharging of utilities, and revenue/profit sharing arrangements with third-party providers. The chart below displays the percentage of our Contribution by business line for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. A brief description of each of our business lines is set forth below. _Rental: Stage and Other Production Accommodation_ Our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line relates to Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. As our core business line, Stage and Other Production Accommodation drives the largest proportion of Contribution. Stage rental relates to the rental of stage space and infrastructure required to produce screen content. The stages are used to house the physical set on which action and sounds are recorded. Our stages come in a variety of sizes and types and are generally soundproofed and heated. Pursuant to the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our existing stage space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios has been contracted by Disney and Netflix, respectively. Other Production Accommodation rental primarily relates to the renting of office space and workshop space where sets are created or stored. Demand for Other Production Accommodation is typically driven by demand for our stages. Pursuant to the terms of the Long-term Contracts, 100% of our existing Other Production Accommodation space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios has been contracted by Disney and Netflix, respectively. See “—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term Contract” and “—Material Contracts—Netflix Long_term Contract.” Stage and Other Production Accommodation as a percentage of Contribution has continued to increase with the completion of approximately 205,000 square feet of lettable space at Pinewood East Phase 2, which was completed in autumn 2019 (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately 39,000 square feet, completed in summer 2020), and will increase further by approximately 1.1 million square feet in aggregate upon completion of the five new stages at Pinewood West, Shepperton North West and Shepperton South development projects. Disney has pre-let the five new stages at Pinewood West as part of the Disney Long-term Contract and Netflix has pre-let approximately 60% of the space being developed at the Shepperton South studio. For more information on our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line, see “—Our Business Lines— _Rental—Stage and Other Production Accommodation.” Rental: Media Hub_ We lease space on-site to independent companies that support film and television production. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios offer approximately 228,000 square feet of space, to approximately 178 independent businesses as of September 30, 2021. The tenants pay rent directly to us and supply their services to ----- the production companies filming at the studios, as well as to external “off-the-lot” customers. Tenants in our Media Hub benefit from association with our strong brand and proximity to their customer base. Historically, the Media Hub has been a secure source of Contribution. There is significant demand for on-site space, with occupancy rates averaging 95% over the past ten fiscal years to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. For more information, see “Summary—Our Key Strengths—Resilient and Cash Generative Business Model Now _Underpinned by Long-term Contracts.” All turnover generated under the Long-term Contracts is reported under_ Stage and Other Production Accommodation. Accordingly, at the commencement of the Long-term Contracts, certain turnover previously reported under the Media Hub business line moved to Other Production Accommodation with any reallocation of the demises in connection with the Long-term Contracts. For more information on our Media Hub business line, see “—Our Business Lines— Rental—Media Hub.” _Rental: Television Studios_ We have three dedicated Television Studios available to hire at Pinewood Studios, one of which is contracted to the National Lottery (Camelot). We have relationships with customers such as the BBC, Endemol Shine UK, Fremantle and Avalon, which contribute to the success of this business line. In addition to earning turnover from Television Studio space, we generate turnover from supplying freelance crew as well as owned and hired television equipment. The Television Studios at Pinewood Studios are excluded from the Disney Long-term Contract and we will continue to manage and hire the Television Studios on a case-by-case basis. For more information on our Television Studios business line, see “—Our Business Lines—Rental—Television Studios.” _Ancillary: Ancillary Studio Services_ Ancillary Studio Services comprise additional services utilised by production companies hiring Stage and Other Production Accommodation. The key services we provide in this business line are utilities (for example, we offer electricity, water and gas, which are principally passed through at cost to our long-term contract customers) and other services through revenue or profit-sharing agreements with preferred third-party service providers. For more information on our Ancillary Studio Services business line, see “—Our Business Lines— _Ancillary—Ancillary Studio Services.” Ancillary: Post Production_ Post Production provides support to content creators. This business line includes localisation services which offer audio mixing in multiple languages for our customers requiring international re-versioning services. In addition, through this business line we offer our customers mixing theatres, cutting rooms, and production offices available for dry hire at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, all of which are excluded from the Long-term Contracts. For more information, see “—Our Business Lines—Ancillary—Post Production.” _Other Activities_ We also generate turnover by providing sales, marketing and brand licensing services and consultancy services relating to studio space to other studios around the world. Historically, we provided these services to studios in Atlanta, Canada, China, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, and Wales. On August 5, 2019, we divested our equity interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios, although we continued to provide sales and marketing services until October 14, 2020, and it ceased to be a Pinewood branded studio on December 14, 2020.

Founded in 1936 and headquartered in the United Kingdom, we own premium, large-scale facilities, also known as studios, for hosting film, television and other media productions. Our two freehold studios, Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, are set over 502 acres with approximately 2.0 million square feet of space in close proximity to central London, which makes us a preferred choice for major film production companies. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios are valued at a Market Value of £2,158 million pursuant to the Valuation Report. Pinewood-branded studios have hosted over 2,000 films, which have received among them 170 Oscar awards and 230 BAFTA awards and include numerous blockbuster film productions such as 23 out of the 25 James Bond films, 16 out of the 27 Marvel super hero films and 8 out of the 12 Star Wars films. We signed long-term index-linked contracts for 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios with Disney and Netflix, respectively in 2019. Collectively, these Long-term Contracts cover a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet. These contracts are each for an initial term of at least ten years and provide for annual rent increases, subject to floors. Disney utilises Pinewood Studios for its own productions as well as for its affiliated production companies, including Lucasfilm and Marvel. Netflix utilises Shepperton Studios as a production hub to produce original content. The Long-term Contracts simplify our business model, improve the resilience and visibility of our turnover from investment-grade rated tenants, and demonstrate the continued demand for our facilities at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. See “—Material Contracts—Disney Long-term Contract” and “—Material Contracts— _Netflix Long-term Contract.”_ Demand for purpose-built studio space remains extremely strong. Over the last few years, we have been progressing our expansion plans at our UK studios, Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. Construction is currently underway for five new stages at Pinewood Studios that will provide approximately 100,000 square feet of additional stage space at Pinewood West, which we anticipate opening in 2022. Disney has pre-let these stages pursuant to the Disney Long-term Contract. At Shepperton Studios, we have detailed planning consent to develop an additional approximately 1.0 million square feet of lettable area, adjacent to the existing studio. We intend to develop this expansion in two phases, which we refer to as Shepperton North West and Shepperton South. Construction of both phases is underway and we have entered into fixed price contracts for the works, thereby significantly derisking the execution of these projects. Additionally, we entered into a long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. The lease will commence on completion of the development, expected towards the end of 2023, and is on terms similar to the Netflix Long-term Contract. There is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Contribution from Stage and Other Production Accommodation, together with the specialty stages, accounted for 83.8% of total Contribution. We earned 98.6% of our total Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 in the United Kingdom, with 92.6% representing rental income at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, our two freehold studios.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Contribution from Stage and Other Production Accommodation, together with the specialty stages, accounted for 83.8% of total Contribution. Rent under the Long-term Contracts is linked to UK RPI, with annual rental rate increases. See “—Material Contracts.” Our Long-term Contracts have not been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to entering into the Long-term Contracts, our studios had a long history of consistently operating at what we believe to be our structural maximum occupancy levels under a model of short-term hire agreements. In addition, our Media Hub business line has also demonstrated consistently high occupancy rates historically. ----- For the past ten fiscal years, our Media Hub business line occupancy rates averaged 95%. For more information, see “—Our Business Lines—Rental—Media Hub.” We have a proven track record of stable or growing Adjusted EBITDA generation, including during both the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. We also benefit from high Adjusted EBITDA margins. For example, we had an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 64% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 65% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The high Adjusted EBITDA margins are attributable to our business model focused on providing infrastructure related offerings. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin tends to increase as we expand the space at our existing studios while leveraging on our existing central and operative functions. In addition, our results benefit from having ceased a number of low margin or loss-making activities. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Statistical, As Adjusted and Other _Financial Data.”_ (1) Joint ventures were proportionally consolidated in accordance with UK GAAP until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013; from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method in accordance with IFRS. Our year-end was December 31 until 2010. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 was based on interim results for twelve-month period ended Dec 31, 2011. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 reflects a twelve-month fiscal year ending on March 31, 2013. In 2021 we entered into an agreement for lease with Netflix in respect of stages, workshops and offices at Shepperton Studios in relation to the Shepperton Expansion Project. See “—Material Contracts—Netflix _Shepperton South Long-term Contract.” For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, our_ _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA would have been £94.3 million, giving pro forma effect to the anticipated EBITDA effects of certain pre-leased space currently being constructed as part of the expansion projects to be funded in connection with the Offering and adding back the effect of certain costs related to the UK Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as illustrated in the table below. For a reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary—Summary _Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Statistical, As Adjusted and Other Financial Data.”_ ----- We have averaged over 93% cash conversion over the past three fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. Maintenance capital expenditure has averaged approximately £3.4 million per annum for the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2021. In addition to this maintenance capital expenditure, we recognised an average of approximately £4.3 million of maintenance spend per annum as an expense within indirect costs for the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2021.

Pro forma for the remaining capex expected to be incurred for the Shepperton Expansion Project and new stage construction at Pinewood West, the adjusted valuation would be £2,672 million. This valuation is supported by the Disney Long-term Contract and the Netflix Long-term Contract which ensure 100% occupancy of our current Stage and Other Production Accommodation for the duration of the contracts, each of which has an initial term of at least ten years as well as the Netflix Shepperton South Long-term Contract. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios are the two largest independent studios in the United Kingdom with a combined approximate 2.0 million square feet of space set over 502 acres and 25 and 14 stages, respectively, close to central London and Heathrow airport. Pinewood Studios is one of the largest independently operated studios in the world in terms of stage space, with approximately 1.4 million square feet of total space on an approximately 379-acre site. It currently has two facilities, Pinewood West and Pinewood East. Shepperton Studios has approximately 600,000 square feet of total space situated on an approximately 123-acre site. It currently has one facility, Shepperton North, and two additional facilities under development, Shepperton North West and Shepperton South. Our studios are capable of hosting productions of various budgets simultaneously. We believe, however, that production companies view our studios as a premium offering well suited for large budget productions, for release either in theatres or on streaming platforms, given the extent and quality of the infrastructure available. Our studios feature a wide range of different size purpose-built stages, workshops, and offices as well as specialised facilities such as exterior and interior water tanks, backlots, television stages, and post production facilities.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.6,Our Key Strengths,521.6.5,Industry with Exceptional Fundamentals,"Our customers operate in a market with strong underlying demand, which is driven by consumption of content, principally blockbuster films and from online streaming platforms. In recent years, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for content from streaming platforms has accelerated. To match this demand, OTT operators have significantly increased their investments in content production. The number of streaming platforms has multiplied in recent years, and operators continue to invest considerably in streaming content, such as Disney, Apple, NBCUniversal and Warner Media. Disney has invested in Disney+, its own direct-to-consumer streaming platform, and expects their investment in original content for this streaming platform to exceed $8 billion by 2024, more than double the amount that was estimated in April 2019. When Disney launched Disney+ in November 2019, 10 million people subscribed on the first day. Disney+ had 87 million subscribers as of September 30, 2021 and is targeting between 230 and 260 million subscribers by 2024. In 2019, Apple increased its committed spending for original video content over the next several years from $1.0 billion to $6.0 billion. NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast, launched its own OTT platform, Peacock, in April 2020 and had 19 million subscribers as of September 2021. Warner Media also launched its own OTT platform, HBO Max, in May 2020 and had 58 million subscribers as of June 2021. In 2021, Warner Media announced that it would premiere 17 movies simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max in the United States. Collectively Disney, Apple, NBCUniversal, Comcast and Warner Media have over 100 million subscribers to their OTT platforms. We believe long-term planning associated with spending on original content by OTT operators and on franchise films (such as the Marvel super hero franchise, _Star Wars or James Bond), has resulted in larger and more predictable annual slates for a number of production companies. Consequently, such production companies are often committing to take production space further in advance of filming (traditionally three months in advance and now up to twelve months in advance). On the back of this demand, in 2019 we entered into the Long-term Contracts with Disney and Netflix who occupy space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. As we continue to see favorable demand-supply fundamentals for purpose-built studio infrastructure, in 2021 we entered into a new long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.6,Our Key Strengths,521.6.6,Significant Barriers to Entry,"The ability to attract large budget productions requires a complex ecosystem, including comprehensive infrastructure with excellent operations, a highly skilled English-speaking workforce (ideally based in close proximity to the studio), good transport links (particularly by air), and a location close to an international city where talent is willing to reside. We benefit from infrastructure developed over decades of hosting films, with a multitude of stage options, as well as a specialist underwater facility, a paddock tank and backlot sites for outdoor filming, ample workshop and office space, businesses on-site providing services to production companies, theatres on-site for post-production editing and convenient transport links. We also benefit from a convenient location, with both Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios approximately one hour from central London and approximately 30 minutes from Heathrow airport. Aside from convenience for our customers, being located close to central London offers certain other strategic advantages. According to the Office for National Statistics, as of 2020 there were approximately 65,967 film and video production workers in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 66% based in London and South East England, which is a draw for major film production companies seeking a location to produce blockbuster films or Highend TV. The production sector workforce has increased by approximately 78% since 2010, at a CAGR of approximately 6%. The production sector workforce has increased by 3% since 2017, at a CAGR of approximately 1%. Whereas studios in many other jurisdictions may require the transport and accommodation of film crews at significant cost, filming at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios provides proximate access to producers, directors, actors, cinematographers and a large skilled worker base including, among others, technicians, engineers, carpenters, make-up artists and wardrobe specialists. Top talent, including producers, directors and cast, are also attracted to London as a filming destination and temporary residence while filming. While there are a number of proposed new studios at various stages of development in the United Kingdom, we believe that any potential competitor would still experience difficulties in locating and developing similarly-sized, well-located sites near central London due to scarcity of land, planning restrictions, high alternative land use values and high build costs. Even if such a site were available, the considerable time and expense required to build similar infrastructure to that of Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, is likely to deter most new market entrants. Additionally, we benefit from relationships with multiple major film production companies spanning decades and such relationships cannot be easily or quickly replicated by new market entrants.

For example, (i) in 2016, we developed approximately 300,000 square feet in connection with Pinewood East Phase 1, and (ii) in 2019, we developed approximately 205,000 square feet in connection with Pinewood East Phase 2 (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately ----- 39,000 square feet, completed in summer 2020). Pinewood East Phase 1 and Pinewood East Phase 2 were leased prior to or immediately after completion, demonstrating our track record of accurately assessing demand and judicious approach to development. In recent years, we have experienced, and continue to experience, excess demand which we believe we will be able to accommodate through further expansion of our existing studios. At Pinewood Studios, we have planned for future revenue growth through pre-letting five sound stages, currently under construction, to Disney and through obtaining planning consent for the future development of Pinewood East Phase 3. Additionally, we own two undeveloped land sites adjacent to the existing facilities totalling approximately 165 acres, which we may use for development in the future. At Shepperton Studios, we are pursuing an expansion on the undeveloped land adjacent to the existing facilities totalling approximately 97 acres, which would add a further approximately 1.0 million square feet of space. The expansion has been substantially de-risked with the long-term contract with Netflix and the signing of a fixed price contract for the construction. Collectively, these projects will allow us to nearly double our stage space in the United Kingdom, allowing us to maintain our market leading position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

We intend to continue to remain focused on providing the infrastructure required to produce film and television content and providing exceptional customer service. To achieve this, we recognise that our people, processes, and systems are fundamental to our success, and we continue to invest in each of these aspects of our business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Strategy,521.7.2,Continue to Expand Our Footprint at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios,"In autumn 2019, we completed the development of Pinewood East Phase 2, comprising approximately 205,000 square feet of stage, workshop and office space (with one of the workshop blocks, totalling approximately 39,000 square feet, completed in summer 2020). The entire development is included in the demise of the Disney Long-term Contract. Looking ahead, we are actively pursuing various expansion projects at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios that will allow us to meet the stable, excess demand for our facilities. The United Kingdom, with its established ecosystem and stable tax incentives, remains one of the most attractive markets for major film production companies and streaming platforms to produce content. We believe that our established locations, combined with the existing infrastructure at our UK studios, afford us a competitive advantage. At Pinewood Studios, and as part of the Disney Long-term Contract, Disney pre-let five new stages at Pinewood West, for which construction is underway and is expected to complete in 2022, adding approximately 100,000 square feet of lettable area and contributing to the future growth of the business. Additionally, the Group also has outline planning consent to develop a further approximately 120,000 square feet in relation to Pinewood East Phase 3. In addition, in September 2020, we submitted an outline planning consent application for the 77 ----- acre site adjacent to Pinewood Studios which we acquired in August 2020 and we refer to as Pinewood South. We expect to receive a decision from the local planning authority before January 2022, and if successful, the planning application would give us the ability to build a global screen industries growth hub comprising (i) additional production accommodation space, (ii) a visitor experience, (iii) an education hub, and (iv) a business growth hub totaling approximately 750,000 square feet. See “—Studios and Facilities—Pinewood Studios.” At Shepperton Studios, we are pursuing an expansion which will add a further 17 new sound stages and Other Production Accommodation space totalling approximately 1.0 million square feet of lettable area in aggregate across two phases. Shepperton North West, the first phase of this expansion, comprises three sound stages and Other Production Accommodation totalling approximately 165,000 square feet. Enabling and early works commenced in May 2021 and we contracted Sir Robert McAlpine to undertake the main works for the development in October 2021. The development is expected to complete in the first half of 2023. Shepperton South, the second larger phase of the expansion, comprises 14 sound stages and Other Production Accommodation totalling approximately 800,000 square feet. Enabling and early works commenced in August 2021 and we have signed a fixed-price main works contract with Laing O’Rourke in November 2021. The development is expected to complete towards the end of 2023. Additionally, we entered into a long-term contract with Netflix to pre-let approximately 0.5 million square feet of space, equivalent to 60% of the space being developed, at our Shepperton South studio. The lease will commence on completion of the development, expected towards the end of 2023, and is on terms similar to the Netflix Long-term Contract. There is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton. Our range of expansion plans that are underway and under consideration are projects, with both short and long-term timeframes, that will allow us to meet the demands of our customers. We continue to adopt a prudent approach to any expansion by conducting various detailed feasibility studies to assess viability and risks and also seek to de-risk the income by entering into long-term rental contracts in advance of the construction completion. In addition, if we undertake any future expansion opportunities for which work has not commenced, we will implement a prudent approach towards financing. We work with reputable construction companies with a track record of timely project completion and have contracts in place that incentivize timely and cost-efficient completions. Our business is highly cash generative and we expect to be able to fund a certain amount of expansionary investment through internal cash generation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Strategy,521.7.3,Continue to Pursue Opportunities for International Expansion,"We believe there is an opportunity to expand our platform to key international markets. We believe the strength of our brand, industry relationships and operational expertise make us a partner and operator of choice for owners of international studios. Our international presence helps us strengthen our market leading position by providing global solutions to our clients. Expanding internationally allows us to capitalise on our existing brand and operational structure, resulting in synergies and an efficient use of resources. We have formulated our strategy for international expansion, focusing on key established markets within North America, Europe, Australia and emerging markets such as China and India, which could be attractive due to the rapidly growing box office sales and strong demand for locally produced content. Should we choose to enter or expand within these markets, we will likely do so by acquiring existing facilities, establishing partnerships with well capitalised, reputable, local owners or developers who recognise the value of partnering with us to brand and operate their studio, or selectively pursuing development opportunities ourselves.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Strategy,521.7.4,,"Since the take private transaction in 2016, our strategy has been based on three pillars. This strategic focus, combined with strong underlying demand for our Stage and Other Production Accommodation and investment into the business has resulted in (i) the simplification of our business following the elimination of several non-core activities, (ii) growth in Adjusted EBITDA over the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, and (iii) increased visibility of future turnover, pursuant to the Long-term Contracts. In the coming years we expect to continue to pursue these same strategies and progress our expansion plans.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.8,Our History,521.8.1,,"Founded in 1936, we have an extensive track record spanning over 80 years during which we hosted some of the global screen-based industries’ most recognisable and commercially successful projects, which have received among them 170 Oscar awards and 230 BAFTA awards and include numerous blockbuster film productions such as 23 out of the 25 James Bond films, 16 out of the 27 Marvel super hero films, and 8 out of the 12 _Star Wars films. Since our founding, over 2,000 films have been filmed at studios operating under the Pinewood brand, including numerous well-known recordings, many of them blockbuster films. We have hosted numerous commercially successful and critically acclaimed films. In 1962, Dr. No, the first James Bond film, was produced at Pinewood Studios. From 1962 to 2019, 23 out of 25 total James Bond films were produced at our studios. In the 1980s, we hosted numerous blockbuster films such as _Batman_ and ----- _Aliens, marking the beginning of Pinewood Studios’ reputation as a home for blockbuster films. This reputation_ continues into the 1990s, 2000s and onwards with films such as Mission Impossible, Gladiator and Skyfall. In 2001, we reinforced our position as a key destination in the United Kingdom for major film and television productions with our acquisition of a 50% equity interest in Shepperton Studios, of which we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in 2014. We further expanded our UK studios in 2016 with the opening of Pinewood East Phase 1. For further information on Pinewood East Phase 1, see “—Studios and Facilities.” In 2004, we completed our initial public offering and were subsequently listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange for over ten years. We were taken private in October 2016 in a transaction undertaken by a fund advised by Aermont, an independent asset management firm focused on real estate and real estate-related investment activities, which has served as investment advisor to four pan-European real estate investment funds with approximately €6.0 billion of total equity commitments, in aggregate.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.9,Our Business Lines,521.9.1,Rental,"Rental activities are the largest contributor to our turnover and comprise stage rental and Other Production Accommodation rental under our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line. The rental category contains three business lines (Stage and Other Production Accommodation, Media Hub and Television Studios) which in total accounted for 92.6% of our Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. _Stage and Other Production Accommodation_ Under our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line, which, together with the specialty stages, accounted for 83.8% of our Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, we offer infrastructure required to produce screen content by third-parties through the rental of 38 stages, as well as other on-site filming facilities for film and television productions at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. In addition, we have secured planning consents for 32 new stages. Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, our two freehold studios, are located in close proximity to central London and feature 24 stages and 14 stages, respectively. Stages range in size from approximately 3,000 square feet to over 59,000 square feet, including the “007” Stage at Pinewood Studios. Occupying 59,092 square feet, the “007” stage is the second largest stage in Europe and one of the largest Stages in the world. The “007” stage has hosted production activities for films such as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, The Da Vinci Code, Charlie and _the Chocolate Factory, Mamma Mia!, Pirates of the Caribbean, as well as various James Bond films, including Spectre and No Time To Die. In total, Pinewood Studios has 11 large stages (in excess of 20,000 square feet), 12_ medium stages (from 5,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet) and one small stage (under 5,000 square feet) in addition to an underwater facility and an outdoor “paddock” water tank, while Shepperton Studios hosts one large stage, 11 medium stages and two small stages. At Pinewood Studios, and as part of the Disney Long-term Contract, we expect to deliver five new stages at Pinewood West, for which construction is underway and is expected to complete in 2022, adding approximately 100,000 square feet of additional stage space. We believe that because these stages are already pre-let by Disney pursuant to the Disney Long-term Contract, the risk associated with their development is limited. With respect to Shepperton Studios, we own a total of approximately 123-acres of land of which 97 acres has the potential for further development. The initial outline planning consent for the expansion and development of Shepperton Studios was obtained in July 2019. For more information on our expansion plans at Shepperton Studios please see, “Summary—Our Key Strengths—Solid Growth Potential with Demonstrated Track Record of _Development” and “Summary—Our Strategy—Continue to Expand Our Footprint at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios.”_ ----- Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios host a selection of backlots, gardens and woodlands available for outdoor shooting within a secure environment, including one of Europe’s largest exterior water “paddock” tanks, with capacity for 806,000 gallons of water, all of which are flexibly suitable for a variety of production types. The backlot areas, including the “paddock” tank are areas available to Disney for their use under the Disney Long-term Contract. The stages can also be used for pre-recorded television, music videos and commercials. For further information on Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, see “—Studios and Facilities.” _Stage interior at Pinewood Studios. © 2021 Pinewood Group Limited._ Historically, stage rental related to the rental of stage space for periods ranging from days to months, depending on the scale of the production. The stages are used to house the physical set on which action and sounds are recorded. These stages come in a variety of sizes and types, including an underwater facility, and are generally soundproofed and heated. Other Production Accommodation rental relates to the renting of office space and workshop space where sets are created. A large amount of office and workshop space is generally required for large scale productions, as producers prefer access to ancillary production elements on-site. We offer a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet of Stage and Other Production Accommodation across Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. In 2019, we entered into the Disney Long-term Contract and Netflix Long-term Contract, which commenced on January 1, 2020 and October 31, 2019, respectively, for 100% of our Stage and Other Production Accommodation at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, respectively. Each Long-term Contract is for an initial term of at least ten years, materially changing the traditional, short-term hire business model and substantially improving our turnover visibility. ----- _Workshop space at Pinewood Studios. © 2021 Pinewood Group Limited. Office space at Pinewood Studios. © 2021 Pinewood Group Limited._ Our current stage occupancy is, and will be going forward, 100% under the Long-term Contracts. For the last ten years, we have maintained an average stage occupancy rate of approximately 95%, which is in part ----- due to our long-term relationships with the major global film production companies, including Disney, EON Productions, Lionsgate, MGM, Paramount Studios, Sony Pictures, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. and Working Title. For further information on our Stage and Other Production Accommodation customers, see “—Our _Customers.” The demand for Other Production Accommodation spaces, such as offices and workshops that_ support production operations during on-site filming, has tended to be driven by the demand for stages. The commencement of the Long-term Contracts will reduce the risk and uncertainty on clients’ upcoming film slates and production needs as we will have greater certainty over rental payments. In 2021, we agreed to lease 50% of the space at Shepperton South on terms similar to the Long-term Contracts. There is strong interest from several customers for the remaining approximately 0.5 million square feet being developed at Shepperton. See “—Material Contracts.” Under standard terms for hires other than the Long-term Contracts, contracted bookings do not contain break clauses, and production companies are responsible for the full cost of their booking even in the case of cancellation. The position is replicated in the Long-term Contracts, where if either Disney or Netflix (as the case may be) do not require part or all of their contracted space, they can ask us to find a third-party production to hire the space. We will attempt (but are under no obligation) to secure a replacement booking but full rental fees remain payable by Disney and/or Netflix under the Long-term Contracts. Where entering into such resale bookings with third party clients, our experience and knowledge of the needs of productions is invaluable, managing the needs, type and size of stage, production offices or any other facilities that will be required. _Media Hub_ We lease space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios to approximately 178 independent businesses that support film and television production, comprising approximately 228,000 square feet as of September 30, 2021. Tenants also benefit from a regular shuttle service to the nearest London Underground and mainline train stations, on-site parking, 24/7 access and on-site restaurants and coffee shops with outdoor areas. Our Media Hub is a significant contributor to the attractiveness of Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, as it offers a “one-stop-shop” model of space and service provision for all aspects of the film production process that cannot be easily replicated. Blockbuster films require a diverse and specialised workforce for filming and the Media Hub at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios helps to support such needs. The Media Hub accounted for 6.8% of our Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. For the past ten fiscal years, our Media Hub business line occupancy rates averaged 95%. Our Media Hub tenants are generally film, television or media-related business and are typically subject to lease terms ranging from twelve to 24 months. Tenants range from individual casting specialists, special effects technicians and a hair and makeup school to offices of large corporations such as Kodak Limited. Our Media Hub leases can be terminated upon (typically) three months’ notice or on expiry. The space is flexible and as evidenced by the Long-term Contracts, can be leased to production companies under our Stage and Other Production Accommodation business line. Space that was previously allocated to Media Hub has been transferred to Other Production Accommodation following the commencement of the Long-term Contracts. For more information on our Media Hub tenants, see “—Our Customers—Media Hub Tenants.” ----- _Special Underwater Facility_ We also have a specialist, permanently-filled indoor underwater facility at Pinewood Studios. This specialist underwater facility is not subject to the Disney Long-term Contract. _Underwater Stage at Pinewood Studios © 2021 Pinewood Group Limited Television Studios_ We offer three dedicated Television Studios which are located at Pinewood Studios and predominantly used for UK productions. The Television Studios business line accounted for 2.1% of our Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. These studios include two 8,960 square foot specialised Television Studios plus a third smaller studio, each fully equipped to film pre-recorded, live and live-audience television productions. The smaller studio, “TV3”, is currently leased to Camelot UK Lotteries Limited for the National Lottery under a multi-year contract. When not being used by Camelot, TV3 is available for hire by other television production companies. Recordings take place on fixed days of the week depending on whether live audiences are required. Film stages can also be temporarily converted to Television Studios when required (and Television Studios can be used for film production), providing additional flexibility. ----- _Television studio interior at Pinewood Studios. © 2021 Pinewood Group Limited._ Our digital Television Studios are generally rented for up to seven weeks (based on the number of television episodes to be filmed) and contract lengths vary widely. Our customers include the BBC, Endemol Shine UK, Fremantle and Camelot. Television production contracts have a broadly similar profile to our Stage and Other Production Accommodation contracts. See “—Stage and Other Production Accommodation.” In addition to charging fees on studio space, we generate turnover from supplying freelance crew, lighting, cameras, technical equipment, dressing rooms and production offices. Rental rates for the Television Studios are packaged to include these services. Over half of turnover related to the Television Studios business line typically relates to these hired-in services specific to a production’s needs. Our Television Studios business is expected to continue to operate as it has historically, as the Television Studios are not subject to the Disney Long-term Contract.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.9,Our Business Lines,521.9.2,Ancillary,"Ancillary services at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios are offered to customers hiring our studios and typically include post production services, utilities and revenue or profit share agreements with preferred service providers (for example, the exclusive provision of lighting equipment through Pinewood MBS). Our ancillary category contains two business lines (Ancillary Studio Services and Post Production) at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios which in total accounted for 6.0% of our Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. _Ancillary Studio Services_ Ancillary Studio Services accounted for 1.9% of our Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Ancillary Studio Services include the provision of utilities (electricity, heating oil, kerosene and gas) to customers on-site, which are sourced through our main supply. We also generate turnover from revenue or profit-sharing agreements with preferred service providers, such as Pinewood MBS. Lighting equipment at both Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios is exclusively provided by Pinewood MBS, a joint venture between the Company and MBS Media Campus, a California-based production ----- resource provider. Pinewood MBS collaborates with production staff to deliver a comprehensive equipment package to producers. The Company has a 25% interest in Pinewood MBS which increased from 15% in June 2020 pursuant to the terms of the Pinewood MBS commercial arrangement. Under standard terms for traditional hire contracts, production companies are required to use Pinewood MBS for production lighting. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Factors Affecting Comparability—Entry into Pinewood MBS Arrangement.” This position is also reflected in our_ Long-term Contracts with Disney and Netflix. In addition, we offer further operational services such as telephone, mailroom and operational support services to our customers at each of Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. _Post Production_ Post Production accounted for 4.1% of our Contribution for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and benefits from relationships and proximity to our Stage and Other Production Accommodation customer base. Post Production provides support to content creators. This business line includes localisation services which offers audio mixing in multiple languages for our customers who require international re-versioning services. In addition, through this business line we offer our customers mixing theatres, cutting rooms, and production offices available for dry hire at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, all of which are excluded from our Long-term Contracts. _Post Production mixing theatre at Pinewood Studios. © 2021 Pinewood Group Limited._ Historically, through Post Production we offered picture services and preparation of “dailies,” or raw, unedited production footage prepared at the end of day of filming and creative audio services involving sound mixing and voice over audio. As of summer 2019, we began to phase out our Pinewood Digital “picture services” business and as of spring 2020, we began to phase out our creative audio business. In addition to picture services and creative audio services, we historically have provided a range of creative audio services to on and off-site film and television productions, including painting, prop-making and drapery through Pinewood Creative. We considered Pinewood Creative to be non-core and ceased these activities in 2017. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Our International Sales and Marketing business line helps us support our market leading position by allowing us to offer our customers a global offering while providing us with a global view of the market and widening our relationships. In connection with our International Sales and Marketing services, we often license the Pinewood brand and provide either sales and marketing services or, less frequently, consultancy services to third parties in exchange for a fee and, in certain circumstances, an ownership or economic interest in their business. We offer services pursuant to sales and marketing contracts for studios operated by international partners in Canada (Pinewood Toronto Studios) and the Dominican Republic (Pinewood Dominican Republic Studios), and historically, in the United States (Pinewood Atlanta Studios) and Malaysia (Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios). These sales and marketing contracts generally have terms of five to ten years. Pursuant to all sales and marketing contracts, we charge an annual sales and marketing fee. We also managed a studio in Wales under a management services agreement (Pinewood Studio Wales) which was terminated on March 31, 2020. Historically, we leased the studio in Wales from the Welsh Ministers. The lease was terminated by agreement in October 2017 and following this termination, we provided management services in return for a fee up to March 31, 2020. We hold a negligible equity interest in Pinewood Dominican Republic Studios. We historically held a negligible equity interest in Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios (which ended in July 2019 upon the termination of our relationship) and a 40% equity interest in Pinewood Atlanta Studios. On August 5, 2019, we completed the sale of our 40% equity in Pinewood Atlanta Studios; however, we continued to provide sales and marketing services until October 14, 2020 under a management services agreement and maintained a trademark license with Pinewood Forest (an entity owned by Pinewood Atlanta Studios). Pinewood Atlanta Studios ceased to be a Pinewood-branded studio on December 14, 2020 with the trademark license with Pinewood Forest also being terminated at this time.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.35,,521.35.1,,"Demand for facilities for film and television production (“content production”) has increased in recent years, driven by continued growth in consumer demand for high quality audio-visual content. Such premium content includes blockbuster films and High-end TV. Blockbuster films have historically accounted for a disproportionate share of global film revenues and content spend, however, with proliferation of streaming, High-end TV is catching up. Only a limited number of production facilities globally regularly host blockbuster films and High-end TV productions, as producers favour locations with well-developed infrastructure in close proximity to a highly skilled and highly specialised film production work force. Other factors, such as the availability of stable and competitive tax incentives and proximity to well connected, international airports and gateway cities are also of critical importance. The United Kingdom generally, and London and southeast England in particular, have developed a film production “ecosystem” that has attracted a large and growing share of the highest budget films globally. The ability to build new film production facilities in such locations is constrained by the scarcity of available land and a number of other factors. In recent years, there has also been a significant growth in spend on original film and High-end TV by OTT operators, such as Netflix and Amazon, with several other operators launching OTT platforms including Disney, Apple, NBCUniversal and Warner Media. This growth in spend has increased demand for our facilities directly as well as indirectly by reducing available space at competitors’ film and television production facilities. We believe long-term planning associated with spending on original content by OTT operators and on franchise films (such as the Marvel super hero franchise, Star Wars and James Bond), has also increased the predictability of spending by a number of production companies. In turn, we have observed an increase in demand to lease production facilities on a long-term basis. On the back of this demand, we entered into Long-term Contracts with Disney and Netflix who occupy space at Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios. We believe that excess demand for similar long-term leases continues to exist.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The Guarantors also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain guarantee limitations as set out therein. In addition, as described below “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain Credit Facilities or Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters or where the time or cost of granting the Notes Guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” For further information on the_ Agreed Security Principles, see “—Security—General.” Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and other similar laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our _Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability.” The validity_ and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor thereunder will be subject to the limitations described under “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security _Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company for application under the Proceeds Loan. As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the Guarantors accounted for 96% the total assets, 99% of turnover and 98% of Adjusted EBITDA of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer is a finance subsidiary formed solely for the purposes of issuing capital markets and other debt on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and as of the New Issue Date its only material assets will be its rights and claims under the Proceeds Loan. As such, the Issuer will be dependent on the Company to make payments on the Proceeds Loan for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. In turn, the Company is a holding company with its material assets being the Capital Stock of its subsidiaries. As such, the Company will be dependent upon its indirect Subsidiaries for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Proceeds Loan. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation, winding up or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the nonguarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer, the Company or such Guarantor. ----- Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

However, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of, or enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture to be secured in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full. The Liens on the Collateral to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are referred to herein collectively as the “Security Interest.” Any other property or assets over which Security Interest may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent conveyance provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with general statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and other similar laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The_ grant and control of the security will also be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles. The following is a nonexhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which provide that Collateral shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would: - result in any breach of general legal and statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction (provided that the relevant grantor of security shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle); - result in a material risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of security of contravention of their fiduciary or statutory duties, any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction and/or of civil or criminal liability (provided that the relevant grantor of security shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle); - result in costs (including adverse effects on or with respect to taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable fees) that, in the opinion of the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company (both acting reasonably), are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that security; - relative to any assets subject a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint or to third party arrangements which prevent those assets from being charged or assigned ----- (provided that this does not prejudice the relevant entity from using all reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to such charging or assignment), including without limitation any joint ventures or shares in joint ventures; - have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant obligor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the agreements to which it is a party; - result in security being given by or over any acquired person or asset which are required to support acquired (or acquisition) indebtedness to the extent such acquired (or acquisition) indebtedness is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition; or - result in security being given over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party. The Agreed Security Principles will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the Company. The Liens securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, and may secure other future Indebtedness Incurred after the Issue Date; _provided, however, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of, or enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super-priority basis have been repaid in full. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” each of the Security Providers, the Issuer and the Guarantors is permitted to charge the Collateral in connection with future Incurrences of Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest will cease to exist by operation of law or will be released, depending on the type of security interest, upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the enforcement or sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the _Notes and Our Structure—It may be difficult to realise the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.” In addition,_ the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to release the Security Interest, by reference to the interests of other creditors of the group. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to (a) public auctions or competitive sales process or (b) after obtaining a valuation and fairness opinion from an investment bank, accountancy firm or other third party professional valuation firm. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the Security Providers, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral, will be permitted to retain entitled and to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash rights to dividends and other distributions (to the extent not prohibited by the Indenture), stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing). The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent, trustee, joint and several creditor and/or beneficiary of any applicable parallel debt under the Intercreditor Agreement and with respect to the Security Interest, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, ----- each holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf. The Indenture will provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Indenture also will provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to have: (1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; (2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and (3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf). See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—The security interests in _the Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_ Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— _Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations and other secured Indebtedness Incurred after the Issue Date (who will have the equal and ratable benefit of the same Collateral). The Security Agent will also act on behalf of certain future secured creditors who are permitted to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will provide that the rights with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent or the parties to the Security Documents. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the Security Interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders.

The Security Agent will commence enforcement action ----- under the Security Documents only in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interest or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

If any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made by or on behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or (2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing _Jurisdiction”),_ will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction ----- from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each holder in respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_ (1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present or deemed present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee; (2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; (3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period); (4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of principal, premium or interest on or with respect to the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee; (5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes; (6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing (or any treaty, law or regulation implementing such an intergovernmental agreement), or any agreement entered into pursuant to section 1471(b) of the Code (or any amended or successor version described above); or (7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. ----- If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further enquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will indemnify each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of Notes after this offering, and limited solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6)). The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.12,Change of Control,21.12.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional _Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to £100,000 or in integral multiples_ of £1,000 in excess thereof; provided, that Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. No later than 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control Triggering Event, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility that permits the lenders thereunder to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “— _Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable_ redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event; provided, however, that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control if either (i) a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer for the Notes is made or (ii) a tender offer with respect to the Company’s or any Parent’s equity securities has been launched that the Issuer believes would more likely than not result in a Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

_provided_ that any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date shall be deemed to be incurred under clause (1)(a) of the preceding paragraph and, for the avoidance of doubt, certain types of obligations (for example, Qualified Securitization Financing) may not qualify as Indebtedness to the extent such obligations are excluded from the definition of Indebtedness; (2) with respect to any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a clause limited by a fixed sterling amount in the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant (other than to the extent such reclassification would result in any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1)(a) of the ----- preceding paragraph to not be entitled to priority with respect to the proceeds from a distressed disposal of, or enforcement of, the Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens); (3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof; (4) in the case of any refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing; (5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, deeds of indemnity, guarantee facilities or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Total Assets at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Total Assets restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Total Assets on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Total Assets restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing; and (9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;_ _provided_ that the amount of any refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness, or the additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock, in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary on such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred on such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any pounds sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another ----- currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Sterling Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a currency agreement (with respect to sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness.

The Revolving Credit Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes.

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period.

Any Affiliate Transaction_ entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “— _Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the_ Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted _Subsidiaries.” On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted_ to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the Event of Default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— _Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of_ the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. ----- Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

It is based on current law and published practice of HMRC, which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. The comments relate only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes, and some aspects do not apply to some classes of persons, such as dealers in securities. Prospective holders of the Notes should be aware that the particular terms of issue of any series of Notes as specified in the relevant terms of the Notes may affect the tax treatment of that and other series of Notes. The following is a general guide for information purposes and should be treated with appropriate caution. It is not intended as tax advice and it does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a prospective purchaser of Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their professional advisers. Prospective holders of the Notes who may be liable to taxation in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes are particularly advised to consult their professional advisers as to whether they are so liable (and if so under the laws of which jurisdictions), since the following comments relate only to certain United Kingdom taxation aspects of payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, holders should be aware that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of taxation under the laws of the United Kingdom. The references in this section (“Certain UK Taxation Considerations”) to “interest”, “premium” and “discount” are to “interest,” “premium” and “discount” as understood in United Kingdom tax law.

A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the US dollar value of the pound sterling interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to US dollars at such time. A cash method US holder will not recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognise exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the pound sterling so received. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the US dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in pound sterling that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The US dollar value of such pound sterling denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis US holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into US dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a US holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an ----- electing US holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the US holder, and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes will recognise exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognised will equal the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the pound sterling payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the US dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to US dollars at such time.

A US holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such US holder. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant US holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such US holder will determine the US dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a US holder receives foreign currency on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the US dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis US holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis US holder, will determine the US dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis US holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the US holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis US holder that does not make the special election will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date. Gain or loss recognised upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be US source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal to the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder disposes of the Note, and the US dollar value of the US holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder may recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder will recognise any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such US holder on such disposition. ----- Any gain or loss recognised upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be US source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate US holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security. Until floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency officeholders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the European Union, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border Recognition _of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings” below)._ English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Notes Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the Issuer in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, of a Notes Guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security interests over the Collateral. ----- The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights for payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, under the Notes Guarantees and/or under the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the ----- amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency” below). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “—Qualifying Floating Charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realise their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations. Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration. A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “—Transactions at an Undervalue”, “—Preference” and “—Voidable Floating Charge” below, respectively).

A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement,” as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration” above). The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Prescribed Part” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

An English Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that ----- such creditors are given under the scheme.

While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed compromise, there is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the meetings of creditors, the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether each applicable statutory condition has been satisfied and consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution ----- of the company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the compulsory windingup of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see “—Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the United Kingdom in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction _of the English Courts” above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies_ registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary windingup – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “Avoidance of _Transactions” below)._ In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislation was introduced to restrict temporarily the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. With effect from 1 October 2021, those restrictions expired and were replaced by new more limited regulations introducing temporary targeted measures to limit the use of winding-up petitions in certain circumstances but not prevent their general use. These temporary measures: (a) raise the threshold upon which a winding up petition may be presented from £750 to £10,000; (b) allow a creditor to present a winding up petition only after expiry of a 21 day period during which the debtor has failed to provide a proposal for repayment satisfactory to the creditor; and (c) prevent landlords petitioning to wind up tenants for unpaid rent arrears arising as a result of COVID-19. The measures will remain in place until 31 March 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in ----- respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness); - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers as well as bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent such claims exceed the statutory limit. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - _Fifth ranking: `o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; `o` secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and `o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. ----- Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000).

In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or ----- instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or guarantee granted by the English Obligors include, without limitation, the following described below: _Transactions at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected Persons” above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where such payment, creation of security interest or guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person when taking their decision. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by ----- reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Transactions Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose an obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Voidable Floating Charges_ Under English insolvency law, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favour of a connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in “Administration” above. _Recharacterisation of Fixed Charges_ As referred to above (see “—Fixed Versus Floating Charges” above), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterised as a floating charge. If such recharacterisation falls within the suspect period referred to ----- above (see “—Voidable Floating Charges” above), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration. _Disclaimer_ An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the ----- statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.” Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Security Registration_ Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the “Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired. The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “—Liquidation/Winding-up” above). _Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_ Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant officeholder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom) ) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the foreign jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties _Recognition in the European Union_ Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the European Union (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the United Kingdom and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognised in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognised and whether investors may adversely affected as a result. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice.

640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"The Initial Purchasers are Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse International, Goldman Sachs International and NatWest Markets Plc. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer has agreed to sell, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase, the entire principal amount of the Notes offered hereby from the Issuer. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates, who are qualified broker dealers under applicable law, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Company and its subsidiaries will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Company has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date the Notes are issued, to not, and to cause its subsidiaries to not, without having received the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that have a tenor of more than one year. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-US persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Investors.” In connection with sales outside the United States, each Initial Purchaser has acknowledged and agreed that it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons (other than “distributors” within the meaning of Regulation S) (a) as part of its distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering or the Issue Date. Each Initial Purchaser will send to each dealer to whom its sells the Notes in reliance on Regulation S during the 40-day distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons. In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the US Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the US Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the US Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Company, its subsidiaries or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us, the Company and its subsidiaries or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum ----- nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.” The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time solicit offers for, or offer or sell, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the US Securities Act or the safe harbours of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. Any Initial Purchaser that is not a registered broker dealer in the United States shall, to the extent that it intends to effect any offers or sales of the Notes in the US or to US persons, do so through an affiliate or any other US registered broker dealer pursuant to applicable US securities laws. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any marketmaking activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the US Securities Act and the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favourable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—There may not be an active _trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ The Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Stabilizing Manager to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes _and Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or on the next successive business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. ----- In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may engage in brokerage activities, may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If one or more Initial Purchaser or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, they may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our affiliates in a manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchaser and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt financing arrangements, including without limitation, acting as initial purchasers under the Existing Notes. Additionally, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have historically provided, and may in the future provide, certain investment and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates (including hedging, customary overdraft facilities, charge cards and hire purchase financings) and have performed, and may perform, other services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received, or may receive, customary advisory and transaction fees, commissions and expense reimbursement. In particular, certain affiliates of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch act as trustee, security agent, principal paying agent, transfer agent and registrar under the Existing Notes Indenture and will act in such roles under the Indenture. Moreover, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are or may become parties to certain of our hedging arrangements, following the closing of the Offering. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

A final and conclusive judgment for a debt or definite sum of money issued by a federal or state court in the United States may (subject to the conditions below) be enforced at common law in England and Wales provided that the party against whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts in accordance with English rules on the conflict of laws. In order to enforce any such US judgment in England or Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England or Wales. In such an action, the court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). However, an English or Welsh court may decline to enforce a US judgment where: - the US judgment was procured by fraud; - the US judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for example the defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an adequate opportunity to be heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment; - recognition of the US judgment would be contrary to English public policy; - recognition of the US judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998; - the US judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is enforceable in an English court; - the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement or a contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; - enforcement of the US judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or penalties (which involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law; - enforcement of the US judgment would contravene Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, which precludes, among other things, the enforcement by any court in the United Kingdom of any judgment given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages which exceed the compensatory element of the judgment award; or - enforcement of the US judgment is time-barred or outside any relevant limitation periods.

The principal accounting policies are stated in the annual consolidated financial statements of Pinewood Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2021 which were prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’. The same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in these interim financial statements and the accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the periods presented. There have been no changes to the Group’s significant judgements as described in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021. Except as noted below, there have been no significant changes to the key sources of estimation uncertainty described in those financial statements. Included within property, plant and equipment are certain assets connected with the Group’s long-standing expansion and redevelopment programme, the cost of which is not yet known with certainty. Liabilities in respect of these amounts are estimated and recognised within capital creditors, totalling £11.4 million (31 March 2021: £6.0 million). The liabilities are reviewed and revised as situations change, when new information becomes available or when further obligations are incurred, or liabilities extinguished. These estimates are sensitive to changes in various assumptions, including capital programme spend (including costs to fulfil the liabilities) and property yields. The estimates and assumptions underpinning the liabilities recorded are felt to be appropriate, but depending on the ultimate outcome, different amounts may be payable. Where it has been presented, the information for the year ended 31 March 2021 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise: - the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income; - the Group Statement of Financial Position; - the Group Statement of Cash Flows; - the Group Statement of Changes in Equity; - the related notes to the Group Financial Statements 1 to 26; - the Parent Statement of Financial Position; - the Parent Statement of Changes in Equity; and - the related notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1 to 13. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). ###### Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ###### Conclusions relating to going concern In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. ###### Other information The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. ----- ##### Independent auditor’s report to the members of Pinewood Group Limited (continued) Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. ###### Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ###### Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. ###### Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. We considered the nature of the group’s industry and its control environment, and reviewed the group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to fraud and compliance with laws and regulations. We also enquired of management, those charged with governance and general council about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities. We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, and identified the key laws and regulations that: - had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. These included the UK Companies Act and tax, VAT and stamp duty legislation; and - do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the UK Bribery Act. We discussed among the audit engagement team including relevant internal specialists such as tax, financial instruments and IT specialists regarding the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements. ----- ##### Independent auditor’s report to the members of Pinewood Group Limited (continued) As a result of performing the above, we identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas, and our specific procedures performed to address them are described below: - There is risk that liability balances, including trade payables, accruals and capital creditors are not complete: We have selected a sample of items from post year end bank statements and post year end purchase invoices after year end. We obtained the supporting documentation for these items and perform procedures to determine whether the transactions have been correctly recorded at or post year end; and - There is risk that capital investments made during the year are not recoverable: We reviewed the costs capitalised on a sample basis against supporting documentation to determine if the asset recognition criteria have been met appropriately. We reviewed the investment plan for the business rationale and opportunities behind the investments. We reviewed the forecasted income statement for the period of recovery for the investments. We verified data used in the forecast to supporting evidence. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override. In addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, we tested the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessed whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluated the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to the risks identified included the following: - reviewing financial statement disclosures by testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements; - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; - enquiring of management and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims, and instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; and - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance and reviewing correspondence with HMRC. ###### Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: - the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and - the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. ###### Matters on which we are required to report by exception Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our opinion: - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. ----- ##### Independent auditor’s report to the members of Pinewood Group Limited (continued) ###### Use of our report This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Group has assessed its turnover arrangements and has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its turnover arrangements. Where a contract spans an accounting cut-off date, the value of the turnover recognised is the proportion of the total value of the contract completed by the cut-off date. The following specific recognition criteria apply for turnover generated from the Group’s single reportable segment: - Film customers utilise services for a period of time. Turnover is recognised as the Group earns the right to consideration for the service provided and this is time apportioned and earned as time elapses. - Film turnover is also derived from international sales and marketing agreements, and certain consultancy agreements. Revenue is recognised based on the passage of time for the former and on a stage of completion basis by reference to costs incurred for the latter. - Television turnover is derived from the provision of services and is recognised on a time apportioned basis in relation to the television production process. - Media Hub turnover is derived from customers contracting to use the Group’s facilities for a period of time. Turnover is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. - Post-production revenue is derived from the provision of services and is recognised as the Group earns the right to consideration on a stage of completion basis by reference to the passage of time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations are reported in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. In the consolidated financial statements exchange differences arising on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) are recognised in other comprehensive income and reported under equity.

Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is recognised on income and expenses from subsidiaries, associates, branches and interests in jointly controlled entities, that will be assessed to, or allowed for, tax in a future period except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the timing difference and it is probable that the timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Goodwill is expected to have a useful life of 10 years and is amortised on a straight-line basis over that period. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cashgenerating unit monitored by management. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. ----- ##### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) for the year ended 31 March 2021 ###### 1 Accounting policies (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is calculated on all property, plant and equipment, other than land, from the time they are available for use on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life as follows: - Freehold buildings - 30 to 50 years - Freehold improvements - 5 to 25 years - Fixtures, fittings and equipment - 3 to 10 years Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The carrying value of freehold land and buildings within Property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position is based on external valuations undertaken by an independent firm of Chartered Surveyors in February 2000 (as amended in January 2001) and November 2000, on each occasion to establish the fair values of the Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios businesses acquired. These valuations were used to establish the initial cost of the freehold land and buildings to the Group. Subsequent additions, disposals and depreciation have been recorded in line with Group accounting policies. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and is written down immediately to the recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year the item is derecognised.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The Group accounts for associates and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recognised in the Group statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of income and other comprehensive income of the participating interest. Should the Group’s share of losses of the associate or joint venture exceed the Group’s interest in that undertaking, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses.

If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (“CGU”) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. _Financial assets and liabilities_ All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value (which is normally the transaction price adjusted for transaction costs), unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. If an arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled, b) the Group transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or c) the Group, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer. Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. _Investments_ Investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary or preference shares (where shares are publicly traded or their fair value is reliably measurable) are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Where fair value cannot be measured reliably, investments are measured at cost less impairment. _Equity instruments_ Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, cash or other resources received or receivable, net of direct issue costs. _Interest bearing loans and borrowings_ Loan and borrowings payable and receivable are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at the fair value of consideration transferred, adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. ----- ##### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) for the year ended 31 March 2021 ###### 1 Accounting policies (continued) _Impairment of financial assets_ At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost (including trade receivables) are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. If an asset is impaired, the loss recognised is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is recognised only to the extent that the revised carrying amount of the asset does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not been previously recognised. _Derivative financial instruments_ The Group has interest rate swaps to hedge against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The Group reports the movement in fair value through profit or loss. The fair values of the interest rate swap contracts are determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. _Fair value measurement_ The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market. When quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place. If the market is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, the Company estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

The amount capitalised is the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term, both determined at inception of the lease. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are expensed as incurred. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. _The Group as lessee - operating leases_ All other leases are operating leases and the annual rentals are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent-free periods or other incentives received for entering into an operating lease are accounted for as a reduction of the expense and are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ----- ##### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) for the year ended 31 March 2021 ###### 1 Accounting policies (continued) _The Group as lessor - operating leases_ Rental income from assets leased under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and recognised as turnover.

There are no judgements that have a significant effect on the Group’s financial statements. Key sources of estimation uncertainty are discussed below. _Recoverability of loan to parent undertaking_ As at the reporting date, the Company has a loan due from its parent company of £328.7 million, which is due for repayment in 2025. This loan is considered fully recoverable. The loan bears interest at 3.55% per annum. The interest rate on the loan was determined with reference to the Group’s borrowing following its refinancing in 2019 and was considered to be a market rate of interest at that time. _S106 liability_ As part of the construction of Pinewood East, the Group entered into a Section 106 agreement with Buckinghamshire County Council. Under this agreement the Group must pay for certain traffic management improvements in the area around the development site. The Group is currently in discussion with Buckinghamshire County Council regarding the implementation of these improvements, and their cost has been estimated and capitalised. During the year, the Group reviewed the latest cost estimates associated with the project and maintained the amount provided at £6.0 million (2020: £6.0 million). This amount is included in capital expenditure related payables and capitalised within the gross cost of plant, property and equipment. The capitalised cost is being depreciated over 50 years and has a remaining NBV of £5.6 million (2020: £5.8 million). During 2021, the Group entered into a Section 106 agreement with Surrey County Council for highway improvements relating to the expansion of Shepperton Studios. The Group has recognised a liability of £0.2 million within capital expenditure related payables based on its obligations at the reporting date and the latest cost estimates for the project. This has been capitalised as part of the cost of the associated studio assets and will be depreciated over the life of those assets. The commitments of the Group under these agreements may be extended as the development projects progress, leading to increased provisions and capitalised cost. However, because the Group has no unprovided obligations in respect of the agreements at the reporting date, no further liability is recognised. _Useful economic lives of Property, plant and equipment and intangible software assets._ The Group holds property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, the total gross cost of which is £414.4 million at 31 March 2021 (2020: £385.2 million). Accumulated depreciation is £89.0 million (2020: £81.3 million) and the charge for the period, including impairments, is £10.3 million (2020: £10.4 million). If the average useful economic life of the assets was reduced by 15% the charge would increase by £1.8 million. As at 31 March 2021, the net book value of intangible software assets capitalised by the Group is £3.6 million (2020: £2.8 million). The software became ready for use in the current year and amortisation of £0.4 million was charged in the period. The software is being amortised over a useful economic life of 10 years. A 15% reduction in the useful economic life would increase the depreciation charge by £0.1 million. Other estimates, assumptions and judgements are applied by the Group. These include, but are not limited to, accruals and provisions for impairments of assets. These estimates, assumptions and judgements are evaluated on a continual basis but are not significant. ----- ##### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) for the year ended 31 March 2021 ###### 2 Turnover and segment information The Group identifies its operating segments based on a combination of factors, including the nature and type of service provided and differences in regulatory environment.

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, net of discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty. The Group has assessed its turnover arrangements and has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its turnover arrangements. Where a contract spans an accounting cut-off date, the value of the turnover recognised is the time proportion of the total value of the contract completed by the cut-off date. The following specific recognition criteria apply for turnover generated from the Group’s single reportable segment: - Film customers utilise services for a period of time. Turnover is recognised as the Group earns the right to consideration for the service provided and this is time apportioned and earned as time elapses. - Film turnover is also derived from international sales and marketing agreements and certain consultancy agreements. Revenue is recognised on a stage of completion basis by reference to costs issued for the former and based on the passage of time for the latter. - Television turnover is derived from the provision of services and is recognised on a time apportioned basis in relation to the television production process. - Media Hub turnover is derived from customers contracting to use the Group’s facilities for a period of time.

In the consolidated financial statements exchange differences arising on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) are recognised in other comprehensive income and reported under equity.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all timing differences that exist at the reporting date. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is recognised on income and expenses from subsidiaries, associates, branches and interests in jointly controlled entities, that will be assessed to, or allow for, tax in a future period except where the company is able to control the reversal of the timing difference and it is probable that the timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any amortisation or accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is expected to have a useful life of 10 years and is amortised on a straight-line basis over that period. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating unit monitored by management. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is calculated on all property, plant and equipment, other than land, from the time they are available for use on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life as follows: - Freehold buildings       - 30 to 50 years - Freehold improvements       - 5 to 25 years - Fixtures, fittings and equipment       - 3 to 10 years Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The carrying value of freehold land and buildings within ‘Property, plant and equipment’ in the statement of financial position is based on external valuations undertaken by an independent firm of Chartered Surveyors in February 2000 (as amended in January 2001) and November 2000, on each occasion to establish the fair values of the Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios businesses acquired. These valuations were used to establish the initial cost of the freehold land and buildings to the Group. Subsequent additions, disposals and depreciation have been recorded in line with Group accounting policies. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and is written down immediately to the recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year the item is derecognised.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Joint ventures arise when two or more parties have joint control of the rights and net assets of the undertaking. The Group accounts for associates and joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recognised in the Group statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share in income and other comprehensive income of the participating interest. Should the Group’s share of losses of the associate or joint venture exceed the Group’s interest in that undertaking, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are only recognised to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Inventory held for distribution at no or nominal consideration is measured at cost, adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential, such as benefits expected from use or sale of the inventory. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether inventories are impaired or if an impairment loss recognised in prior periods has reversed. Any excess of the carrying amount of stock over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss. Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (“CGU”) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. _Financial assets and liabilities_ All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value (which is normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs), unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. If an arrangement constitutes a finance transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled, b) the Group transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or c) the Group, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer. Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. _Investments_ Investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary or preference shares (where shares are publicly traded or their fair value is reliably measurable) are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Where fair value cannot be measured reliably, investments are measured at cost less impairment. _Equity instruments_ Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, cash or other resources received or receivable, net of direct issue costs. _Fair value measurement_ The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market. When quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place. If the market is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, the Company estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique. _Interest bearing loans and borrowings_ Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at the fair values of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. ----- Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. _Investments_ In the Company statement of financial position, for investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued. Any premium is ignored. _Equity instruments_ Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, cash or other resources received or receivable, net of direct issue costs. _Interest bearing loans and borrowings_ Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at the fair values of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The loan issue costs are amortised in the income statement over the remaining maturity of the loans at a constant carrying amount and are reviewed for changes in circumstances that may indicate that the loans will not be held to maturity. _Derivative financial instruments_ The Company has interest rate swaps to hedge against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each statement of financial position date. The Company reports the movement in fair value through profit or loss. The fair values of the interest rate swap contracts are determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest payable and similar charges.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The amount capitalised is the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term, both determined at inception of the lease. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are expensed as incurred. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. _The Group as lessee - operating leases_ All other leases are operating leases and the annual rentals are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent free periods or other incentives received for entering into an operating lease are accounted for as a reduction to the expense and are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. _The Group as lessor - operating leases_ Rental income from assets leased under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and recognised as turnover. Rent free periods or other incentives given to the lessee are accounted for as a reduction to the rental income and recognised on a straight-line basis over the term. Initial direct costs associated with arranging the operating lease are included in the carrying amount of the underlying leased asset and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis in proportion to the recognition of lease income. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Adjusted items are transactions that are unusual in size or nature or have limited predictive value such as disposals, discontinued operations, impairments, certain fair value remeasurements and other significant items. The identification and presentation of transactions as adjusted items requires judgement. _Recoverability of trade and other receivables_ The recoverability of financial assets, including trade and other receivables, requires judgement. The Group regularly reviews financial assets for evidence of impairment and as at 31 March 2020 had recorded provision of £0.5 million against trade receivables. As at the balance sheet date, the Company has a loan due from the Group’s parent undertaking of £317.7 million due for repayment in 2025 and is considered fully recoverable. _Classification of investment in PMBS Holding Limited_ In 2015, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire a 15% equity interest in PMBS Holding Limited (PMBS) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Pinewood MBS Lighting Limited, a company that was subsequently granted an arrangement to provide lighting services at the Group's UK facilities. The agreement included an option to step-up the Group’s equity interest in PMBS to 25% after 5 years for nil consideration. In December 2019, the option became exercisable and the majority investor in PMBS served notice to defer a number of its ordinary shares in PMBS sufficient to increase the Group’s interest to 25%. The re-designation of these deferred shares is automatic and does not require shareholder approval or resolution. As at 31 December 2019, the Group deemed that the holding of an exercisable option to step-up the equity in PMBS gave the Group an effective interest in PMBS of 25% and after reviewing all the facts and circumstances considered the Group had significant influence over the entity. Accordingly, PMBS was classified as an associate prospectively from 31 December 2019. As at 31 March 2020, PMBS had not yet served the required notices to confirm the re-designation of deferred shares, nor issued the new share certificates and therefore the Group’s legal interest in PMBS remained at 15% at the balance sheet date. Prior to 31 December 2019, the initial 15% equity interest in PMBS Holding Limited was classified as a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and presented within Other investments. Following the classification of PMBS to an associate, the financial asset was derecognised, rerecognised as an interest in associate and measured at the original cost of the investment in accordance with FRS 102. The total equity interest in PMBS was acquired at nil cost to the Group. Accordingly, the recognition of the investment as an associate required the cumulative unrealised fair value gains booked in prior years to be reversed, resulting in the recognition of an unrealised non-cash charge of £1.7 million, presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an adjusted item (note 3). In addition, the Group reclassified its investment in PMBS Holding Limited loan notes from Trade and other receivables to Interests in associates. PMBS made the required notices to confirm the re-designation of deferred shares and legally increase the Group’s interest in the associate to 25% on 15 June 2020. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The loan notes are due to be paid by 2025 and bear interest at 8% per annum, settled in June and December. The loan notes are classified as a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and following the reclassification of PMBS from investment to associate described above, are presented on the statement of financial position within Interests in associates. The fair value of the loan notes is established using a discounted cashflow model. The Group considers the coupon rate on the loan notes of 8% to be a market rate of interest and as such are discounted at that rate. The repayment of the loan notes is dependent on the future cash generation of PMBS and therefore a significant deterioration in the revenues of PMBS could impact the recoverability of the loan notes. As at 31 March 2020, the loan notes were valued at £2.3 million. Increasing the discount rate used to value the cash flows to 10% would reduce the valuation to £2.1 million. _Loan to parent company_ As at 31 March 2020, the Group has a loan due from its parent undertaking of £317.7 million which bears interest at 3.55% per annum. The interest rate on the loan was determined with reference to the Group’s borrowings following the refinancing completed in the year and was considered to be a market rate of interest at that time. _S106 liability_ In order to facilitate the construction of Pinewood East, the Group entered into a Section 106 agreement with Buckinghamshire County Council. Under this agreement the Group must pay for traffic improvements at the Iver Heath Five Points roundabout. These improvements, the implementation of which the Group is currently in discussion with Buckinghamshire County Council, have been estimated and capitalised at cost. During the year, the Group reviewed the latest cost estimates associated with the project and increased the amount provided by £2.0 million to £6.0 million (2019: £4.0 million). This amount is included in accruals and capitalised within the gross cost of plant, property and equipment. The capitalised cost is being depreciated over 50 years and has a remaining NBV of £5.8 million (2019: £3.8 million). _Fixed asset useful economic lives._ The Group holds property, plant and equipment at amortised cost, the total gross cost of which is £385.2 million at 31 March 2020 (2019: £350.8 million). Accumulated depreciation is £81.3 million (2019: £84.0 million) and the charge for the period, including impairments, is £10.4 million (2019: £8.7 million). If the average useful economic life of the assets was reduced by 15% the charge would increase by £1.7 million. Other estimates, assumptions and judgements are applied by the Group. These include, but are not limited to, accruals and provisions for impairments of assets. These estimates, assumptions and judgements are also evaluated on a continual basis but are not significant. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

The exercise included a transaction subject to stamp duty land tax and an amount of £2.6 million land transfer tax was subsequently calculated and paid in the year. The restructure is expected to facilitate current and future commercial arrangements. In February 2020, the Group received £2.8 million for the sale of its interest in POP Global Ltd.

Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, net of discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty. The Group has assessed its turnover arrangements and has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its turnover arrangements. Where a contract spans an accounting cut-off date, the value of the turnover recognised is the time proportion of the total value of the contract completed by the cut-off date. The following specific recognition criteria apply: ----- Media Services: - Film customers utilise services for a period of time. Turnover is recognised as the Group earns the right to consideration for the service provided and this is time apportioned and earned as time elapses. - Film turnover is also derived from international sales and marketing agreements and certain consultancy agreements. Revenue is recognised on a stage of completion basis by reference to costs issued for the former, and based on the passage of time for the latter. - Television turnover is derived from the provision of services and is recognised on a time apportioned basis in relation to the television production process. - Media Hub turnover is derived from customers contracting to use the Group’s facilities for a period of time. Turnover is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement. Media Investment: - The business segment ceased trading in the year ended 31 March 2018 with certain legacy balances remaining at the reporting date. - External investment advisory turnover is derived from the provision of services on a per film investment basis, with turnover from an annual management fee recognised on a straight line basis over the course of the year. - Film Production Companies’ turnover relates to the funding provided from the various financiers (excluding loans against tax credit, which are recognised as a liability on the Group statement of financial position).

Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.

Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is recognised on income and expenses from subsidiaries, associates, branches and interests in jointly controlled entities, that will be assessed to, or allow for, tax in a future period except where the company is able to control the reversal of the timing difference and it is probable that the timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Goodwill is expected to have a useful life of 10 years and is amortised over that period. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is calculated on all property, plant and equipment, other than land, from the time they are available for use on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life as follows: Freehold buildings      - 30 to 50 years Freehold improvements      - 5 to 25 years Leasehold improvements      - shorter of 25 years or the term of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment - 3 to 10 years Land and assets under construction are not depreciated. The carrying value of freehold land and buildings within ‘Property, plant and equipment’ in the statement of financial position is based on external valuations undertaken by an independent firm of Chartered Surveyors in February 2000 (as amended in January 2001) and November 2000, on each occasion to establish the fair values of the Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios businesses acquired. Subsequent to these valuations, which established the cost to the Group of freehold land and buildings, additions, disposals and depreciation have been recorded in line with Group accounting policies. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and is written down immediately to the recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal. Any gain or loss arising in derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby two or more parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The Group accounts for joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, a joint venture is initially recognised in the Group statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s income from participating interests and other comprehensive income of the joint venture. When the Group’s share of losses of the joint venture exceeds the Group’s interest in that joint venture, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are only recognised to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. When a Group entity transacts with a joint venture of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the joint venture are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the joint venture that are not related to the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468

Inventory held for distribution at no or nominal consideration is measured at cost, adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential, i.e. benefits expected from use or sale of the inventory. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether inventories are impaired or if an impairment loss recognised in prior periods has reversed. Any excess of the carrying amount of stock over its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss.

If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or ----- cash-generating unit’s (“CGU”) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
640,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,535,COVID-19,535.185,1** **Accounting policies,535.185.23,Financial instruments,"Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. _Financial assets and liabilities_ All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value (which is normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs), unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. If an arrangement constitutes a finance transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled, b) the Group transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or c) the Group, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer. Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. _Investments_ In the Company statement of financial position, for investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued. Any premium is ignored. _Equity instruments_ Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, cash or other resources received or receivable, net of direct issue costs. _Fair value measurement_ The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market. When quoted prices are unavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place. If the market is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, the Company estimates the fair value by using a valuation technique. _Interest-bearing loans and borrowings_ Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at the fair values of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. ----- _Derivative financial instruments_ The Group has interest rate swaps to hedge against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each statement of financial position date. The Group reports the movement in fair value through profit or loss. The fair values of the interest rate swap contracts are determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. _Financial assets and liabilities_ All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value (which is normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs), unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. If an arrangement constitutes a finance transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled, b) the Group transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, or c) the Group, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer. Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. _Equity instruments_ Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of proceeds received, cash or other resources received or receivable, net of direct issue costs. _Interest-bearing loans and borrowings_ Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at the fair values of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The loan issue costs are amortised in the income statement over the remaining maturity of the loans at a constant carrying amount and are reviewed for changes in circumstances that may indicate that the loans will not be held to maturity. _Derivative financial instruments_ The Company has interest rate swaps to hedge against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each statement of financial position date. The Company reports the movement in fair value through profit or loss. The fair values of the interest rate swap contracts are determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.

Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.

The Group was issued ----- equity and loan notes equal to a 15% share of the debt and equity of PMBS Holdings Limited when the initial investment was made. At each reporting date management make an estimate of the fair value of both the value of the loan notes and the value of the equity investment. In determining the fair value of the loan notes management review the future cash flows attributable to those loan notes, and in determining the fair value of the equity holding management perform a value in use exercise, using a discounted cashflow model. The key inputs in respect of the discounted cashflow model are the discount factor, the projected annual cashflows and the annual growth factor applied. In the case of the loan notes, these are interest bearing at 8% per annum and management considers this to be a market rate of interest and as such are discounted at that rate. Further details are included in Note 16. An adverse movement of 10% points on the discount factor, or a 50% reduction on the annual cashflows of PMBS, when applied to the equity would result in an impairment, and could result in the recoverability of the loan notes being considered doubtful. _S106 liability_ In order to facilitate the construction of Pinewood East, the Group entered into a Section 106 agreement with Buckinghamshire County Council. Under this agreement the Group must pay for traffic improvements at the Iver Heath Five Points roundabout. These improvements, the implementation of which the Group is currently in discussion with Buckinghamshire County Council, have been estimated and capitalised at cost. Included in both accruals and the gross cost of plant, property and equipment is an estimate of £4.0 million (2018: £4.0 million), relating to this agreement. The capitalised gross cost is being depreciated over 50 years and has a remaining NBV of £3.8 million (2018: £3.9 million). _Atlanta joint venture_ The Group’s investment in the Atlanta Joint Venture is accounted for using the equity accounting method. Management has performed an impairment review of the asset, calculating a value in use through application of a discounted cashflow model. Key inputs into the model are the expected levels of occupancy of the studio space, the price and the discount factor applied. The assumptions applied to these factors support the carrying value of the asset. A movement in these factors may have an impact on that value. The carrying value of the investment at 31 March 2019 was £13.3 million (2018: £11.0 million). There are no indicators of impairment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,468
