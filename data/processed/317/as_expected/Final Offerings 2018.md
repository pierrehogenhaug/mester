### 3.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2028

We are offering €350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% senior subordinated notes due 2028 (the
“notes”).

The notes will mature on March 15, 2028. The notes will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 3.875% to be
payable semi-annually on each March 15 and September 15, beginning on September 15, 2018. Interest will accrue from
March 14, 2018.

We may redeem the notes at any time on or after March 15, 2023 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum. In addition, prior to March 15, 2023, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus the “make-whole” premium set forth in this
offering memorandum. We may redeem up to 35% of the notes on or prior to March 15, 2021 with the proceeds of
certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum. If we experience certain changes
of control, we must offer to purchase the notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any.

The notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by our current and future domestic subsidiaries that
guarantee our indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement. The notes and guarantees described above will be
general senior subordinated obligations ranking equally with our other senior subordinated debt and will be
subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors’ senior debt, including our revolving credit agreement. In
addition, the notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries which are not
guarantors.

**connection with an investment in the notes.**

**Price: 100% plus accrued interest, if any, from March 14, 2018.**

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any other federal or state securities commission
has approved or disapproved of the notes or determined if this offering memorandum is truthful or complete. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

**The notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities**
**Act”), or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or**
**benefit of, any U.S. person except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration**
**requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only (a) to persons reasonably**
**believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and (b) outside the**
**United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. For details about eligible**
**offers, deemed representations and agreements by investors and transfer restrictions, see “Notice to Investors.”**

**MIFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturer, the target
market assessment in respect of the notes described in this offering memorandum has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such notes is persons satisfying the criteria of the
definition of “eligible counterparties” or “professional clients” only, each as defined in Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such notes to such
persons are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of such notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

ii


-----

**PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition on Sales to European Economic Area Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPS Regulation.

**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**

This offering memorandum may include “forward-looking statements” as defined by the
SEC. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this offering
memorandum that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or
anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are
based on certain assumptions made by us based on our experience and perception of historical
trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are
appropriate under the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions,
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause our actual
results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements.
We do not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements following the date
of this offering memorandum. For a description of these risks, please read our risk factors set
forth in this offering memorandum and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017, which is incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

Additional factors that may cause actual results to differ from our expectations include: the
impact of a challenging global economy or a downturn in served markets; the competitiveness
of the global broadcast, enterprise, and industrial markets; the inability to successfully complete
and integrate acquisitions in furtherance of the Company’s strategic plan; volatility in credit and
foreign exchange markets; variability in the Company’s quarterly and annual effective tax rates;
the cost and availability of raw materials including copper, plastic compounds, electronic
components, and other materials; disruption of, or changes in, the Company’s key distribution
channels; the inability to execute and realize the expected benefits from strategic initiatives
(including revenue growth, cost control, and productivity improvement programs); disruptions
in the Company’s information systems including due to cyber- attacks; the inability of the
Company to develop and introduce new products and competitive responses to our products;
the inability to retain senior management and key employees; assertions that the Company
violates the intellectual property of others and the ownership of intellectual property by
competitors and others that prevents the use of that intellectual property by the Company; risks
related to the use of open source software; the impact of regulatory requirements and other
legal compliance issues; perceived or actual product failures; political and economic
uncertainties in the countries where the Company conducts business, including emerging
markets; the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and the resulting impact on
financial performance; disruptions and increased costs attendant to collective bargaining groups
and other labor matters; and other factors.

**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

SEC rules regulate the use in filings with the SEC of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such
as free cash flow, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, which are derived on the basis of
methodologies other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”). We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities, adjusted for capital
expenditures net of the proceeds from the disposal of tangible assets. We define EBITDA as
earnings from continuing operations before net interest, income taxes, depreciation, and
amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus certain items, such as asset
impairments; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting
effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred
revenue to fair value and transaction costs; revenue and cost of sales deferrals for acquired
product lines subject to software revenue recognition accounting requirements; gains (losses)
on the disposal of businesses and tangible assets, gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, sharebased compensation expense, and other costs. We do not adjust for ongoing operating
expenses. We adjust for the items listed in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly
immaterial to our financial statements.

We utilize the non-GAAP results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of the
adjustments and for comparison to budgeted operating results. We believe the non-GAAP
results are useful to investors because such results help investors compare our financial
performance to previous periods and provide insights into underlying trends in the business
and how management oversees our business operations on a day-to-day basis. As an example,
we adjust for the purchase accounting effect of recording deferred revenue at fair value in order
to reflect the revenues and gross profit that would have otherwise been recorded by acquired
businesses as independent entities. We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the
underlying performance of acquired companies. Similarly, we adjust for other acquisition
related expenses, such as amortization of intangibles and other impacts of fair value
adjustments because they are not related to the acquired entity’s core business performance. As
an additional example, we exclude the costs of restructuring programs, which can occur from
time to time for our current businesses and/or recently acquired businesses. We exclude the
costs of these programs from our Adjusted EBITDA to allow us and investors to evaluate the
performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe
the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of the programs, provides
valuable insight.

The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for net income, cash flows from operating activities, and other statement of
operations or cash flows data prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity or
profitability. Our measurements of free cash flow, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA may differ
from those of other companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to those of other
companies. See “Summary Consolidated Historical Financial Data of Belden Inc.” in this
offering memorandum for additional information.

the execution of our Belden Business System. The Belden Business System has three
areas of focus. First, we demonstrate a commitment to Lean enterprise initiatives, which
improve not only the quality and efficiency of the manufacturing environment, but our
business processes on a company-wide basis. Second, we utilize our Market Delivery
System (“MDS”), a go-to-market model that provides the foundation for organic growth.
We believe that organic growth, resulting from both market growth and share capture, is
essential to our success. Finally, our Talent Management System supports the
development of our associates at all levels, which preserves the culture necessary to
operate our business consistently and sustainably.

   - **Cash Generation — Our pursuit of operational excellence results in the generation of**
significant cash flow. We generated cash flows from operating activities of $255.3
million, $314.8 million and $241.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

continued transformation and generate shareholder value. We continuously improve our
portfolio to ensure we provide the most complete, end-to-end solutions to our

customers. Our portfolio is designed with balance across end markets and geographies
to ensure we can meet our goals in most economic environments. We have a disciplined
acquisition cultivation, execution, and integration system that allows us to invest in
outstanding companies that strengthen our capabilities and enhance our ability to serve
our customers.

A key part of our business strategy includes acquiring companies to support our growth
and product portfolio. Our acquisition strategy is based upon targeting leading companies that
offer innovative products and strong brands. We utilize a disciplined approach to acquisitions
based on product and market opportunities. When we identify acquisition candidates, we
conduct rigorous financial and cultural analyses to make certain that they meet both our
strategic plan targets and our goal for return on invested capital.

**Recent Developments**

**Concurrent Tender Offers**

On March 6, 2018, we commenced cash tender offers (each, a “Tender Offer” and together,
the “Tender Offers”) for any and all of our outstanding 5.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due
2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and our outstanding 5.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the
“2024 Notes” and together with the 2023 Notes, the “Tender Offer Notes”). The aggregate
principal amount outstanding of the 2023 Notes as of March 2, 2018 is €200 million
(approximately $242.5 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2017 of 1.2018
dollars per Euro). The aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2024 Notes as of March 2,
2018 is $200 million. We are offering to purchase for cash the 2023 Notes in an amount equal to
€1,032.50 per €1,000 principal amount and the 2024 Notes in an amount equal to $1,059.00 per
$1,000 principal amount, in each case together with accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase
date. The Tender Offers will expire on March 12, 2018. The Tender Offers are being made on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Offer to Purchase dated March 6, 2018. This
offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to
sell the Tender Offer Notes.

Each Tender Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, our completion of this offering
or other satisfactory financing. However, this offering is not conditioned upon the
consummation of either Offer at any minimum level of acceptance.

If all of the Tender Offer Notes are tendered and purchased in the Tender Offers, the holders

**RISK FACTORS**

An investment in our notes involves risks. You should carefully consider all of the
information contained in this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by
reference as provided under “Where You Can Find More Information,” including our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. This offering memorandum and the
documents incorporated by reference also contain forward-looking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties. Please read “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as
a result of certain factors, including the risks described below, elsewhere in this offering
memorandum and in the documents incorporated by reference. If any of these risks occur, our
business, financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**A challenging global economic environment or a downturn in the markets we serve could**
**adversely affect our operating results in a material manner.**

A challenging global economic environment could cause substantial reductions in our
revenue and results of operations as a result of weaker demand by the end users of our
products and price erosion. Price erosion may occur through competitors becoming more
aggressive in pricing practices. A challenging global economy could also make it difficult for our
customers, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Our
customers could also face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could have an
adverse effect on our results if such events cause reductions in revenues, delays in collection, or
write-offs of receivables. Further, the demand for many of our products is economically
sensitive and will vary with general economic activity, trends in nonresidential construction,
investment in manufacturing facilities and automation, demand for information and broadcast
technology equipment, and other economic factors.

Global economic uncertainty could result in a significant decline in the value of foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which could result in a significant adverse effect on our
revenues and results of operations; could make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to
accurately forecast and plan future business activities; and could cause our customers to slow
or reduce spending on our products and services. Economic uncertainty could also arise from
fiscal policy changes in the countries in which we operate.

Changes in foreign currency rates and commodity prices can impact the buying power of
our customers. For example, a strengthened U.S. dollar can result in relative price increases for
our products for customers outside of the U.S., which can have a negative impact on our
revenues and results of operations. Furthermore, customers’ ability to invest in capital
expenditures, such as our products, can depend upon proceeds from commodities, such as oil
and gas markets. A decline in energy prices, therefore, can have a negative impact on our
revenues and results of operations.

**The global markets in which we operate are highly competitive.**

We face competition from other manufacturers for each of our global business platforms
and in each of our geographic regions. These companies compete on price, reputation and
quality, product technology and characteristics, and terms. Some multinational competitors
have greater engineering, financial, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we have.
Actions that may be taken by competitors, including pricing, business alliances, new product

13


-----

introductions, market penetration, and other actions, could have a negative effect on our
revenues and profitability. Moreover, some competitors that are highly leveraged both
financially and operationally could become more aggressive in their pricing of products.

**Volatility of credit markets could adversely affect our business.**

Uncertainty in U.S. and global financial and equity markets could make it more expensive
for us to conduct our operations and more difficult for our customers to buy our products.
Additionally, market volatility or uncertainty may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete
acquisitions. Our ability to implement our business strategy and grow our business, particularly
through acquisitions, may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt
securities or obtaining additional debt financing. Market conditions may prevent us from
obtaining financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us.

**We may be unable to achieve our goals related to growth.**

In order to meet the goals in our strategic plan, we must grow our business, both
organically and through acquisitions. Our goal is to generate total revenue growth of 5-7% per
year in constant currency. We may be unable to achieve this desired growth due to a failure to
identify growth opportunities, such as trends and technological changes in our end markets. We
may ineffectively execute our Market Delivery System, which is designed to identify and capture
growth opportunities. The broadcast, enterprise, and industrial end markets we serve may not
experience the growth we expect. Further, those markets may be unable to sustain growth on a
long-term basis, particularly in emerging markets. If we are unable to achieve our goals related
to growth, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows.

**We may be unable to implement our strategic plan successfully.**

Our strategic plan is designed to continually enhance shareholder value by improving
revenues and profitability, reducing costs, and improving working capital management. To
achieve these goals, our strategic priorities are reliant on our Belden Business System, which
includes continuing deployment of our MDS so as to capture market share through end-user
engagement, channel management, outbound marketing, and careful vertical market selection;
improving our recruitment and development of talented associates; developing strong global
business platforms; acquiring businesses that fit our strategic plan; and becoming a leading
Lean company. We have a disciplined process for deploying this strategic plan through our
associates. There is a risk that we may not be successful in developing or executing these
measures to achieve the expected results for a variety of reasons, including market
developments, economic conditions, shortcomings in establishing appropriate action plans, or
challenges with executing multiple initiatives simultaneously. For example, our MDS initiative
may not succeed or we may lose market share due to challenges in choosing the right products
to market or the right customers for these products, integrating products of acquired companies
into our sales and marketing strategy, or strategically bidding against OEM partners. We may
fail to identify growth opportunities. We may not be able to acquire businesses that fit our
strategic plan on acceptable business terms, and we may not achieve our other strategic
priorities.

14


-----

**We may be unable to achieve our strategic priorities in emerging markets.**

Emerging markets are a significant focus of our strategic plan. The developing nature of
these markets presents a number of risks. We may be unable to attract, develop, and retain
appropriate talent to manage our businesses in emerging markets. Deterioration of social,
political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region may adversely affect our
operations or financial results. Emerging markets may not meet our growth expectations, and
we may be unable to maintain such growth or to balance such growth with financial goals and
compliance requirements. Among the risks in emerging market countries are bureaucratic
intrusions and delays, contract compliance failures, engrained business partners that do not
comply with local or U.S. law, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, fluctuating currencies
and interest rates, limitations on the amount and nature of investments, restrictions on
permissible forms and structures of investment, unreliable legal and financial infrastructure,
regime disruption and political unrest, uncontrolled inflation and commodity prices, fierce local
competition by companies with better political connections, and corruption. In addition, the
costs of compliance with local laws and regulations in emerging markets may negatively impact
our competitive position as compared to locally owned manufacturers.

**The presence of substitute products in the marketplace may reduce demand for our products**
**and negatively impact our business.**

Fiber optic systems are increasingly substitutable for copper based cable systems.
Customers may shift demand to fiber optic systems with greater capabilities than copper based
cable systems, leading to a reduction in demand for copper based cable. We may not be able to
offset the effects of a reduction in demand for our copper-based cable systems with an increase
in demand for our existing fiber optic systems. Further, the supply chain in the fiber market is
highly constrained, with a small number of vertically integrated firms controlling critical inputs
and the related intellectual property. These factors, either together or in isolation, may
negatively impact revenue and profitability.

**Our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products and**
**respond to changes in customer preferences.**

Our markets are characterized by the introduction of products with increasing technological
capabilities. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that
appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we
serve. Developing new products and adapting existing products to meet evolving customer
expectations requires high levels of innovation, and the development process may be lengthy
and costly. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond
to changes in customer preferences, demand for our products could decline.

The relative costs and merits of our solutions could change in the future as various
competing technologies address the market opportunities. We believe that our future success
will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop and
manufacture new products that meet or anticipate technological changes, which will require
continued investment in engineering, research and development, capital equipment, marketing,
customer service, and technical support. We have long been successful in introducing
successive generations of more capable products, but if we were to fail to keep pace with
technology or with the products of competitors, we might lose market share and harm our
reputation and position as a technology leader in our markets.

15


-----

**The increased prevalence of cloud computing may negatively impact certain aspects of our**
**business.**

The nature in which many of our products are purchased or used is evolving with the
increasing prevalence of cloud computing and other methods of off-premises computing and
data storage. This may negatively impact one or more of our business in a number of ways,
including:

   - Consolidation of procurement power leading to the commoditization of IT products;

   - Reduction in the demand for infrastructure products previously used to support on-site
data centers;

   - Lowering barriers to entry for certain markets, leading to new market entrants and
enhanced competition;

   - Preferences for software as a service billing and pricing models may reduce demand for
non-cloud “packaged” software.

Alterations to our product mix and go-to-market strategies designed to respond to the
changes in the marketplace presented by cloud computing may be disruptive to our business
and lead to increase expenses, which may result in lower revenues and profitability. Further, if a
competitor is able to more quickly or efficiently adapt, or if cloud computing results in
significantly lower barriers to entry and new competitors enter our markets, demand for our
products may be reduced.

**We must complete further acquisitions in order to achieve our strategic plan.**

In order to meet the goals in our strategic plan, we must complete further acquisitions. The
extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made will affect our overall growth, operating
results, financial condition, and cash flows. Our ability to acquire businesses successfully will
decline if we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition targets consistent with our strategic
plan, the competition among potential buyers increases, the cost of acquiring suitable
businesses becomes too expensive, or we lack sufficient sources of capital. As a result, we may
be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous
acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire.

**We may have difficulty integrating the operations of acquired businesses, which could**
**negatively affect our results of operations and profitability.**

We may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses and future acquisitions might not
meet our performance expectations. Some of the integration challenges we might face include
differences in corporate culture and management styles, additional or conflicting governmental
regulations, preparation of the acquired operations for adoption of ASC 606, compliance with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, financial reporting that is not in compliance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, disparate company policies and practices, customer relationship
issues, and retention of key personnel. In addition, management may be required to devote a
considerable amount of time to the integration process, which could decrease the amount of
time we have to manage the other businesses. We may not be able to integrate operations
successfully or cost-effectively, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations
or our profitability. The process of integrating operations could also cause some interruption of,
or the loss of momentum in, the activities of acquired businesses.

16


-----

**Our results of operations are subject to foreign and domestic political, economic, and other**
**uncertainties and are affected by changes in currency exchange rates.**

In addition to manufacturing and other operating facilities in the U.S., we have
manufacturing and other operating facilities in Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, St. Kitts,
and several European countries. We rely on suppliers in many countries, including China. Our
foreign operations are subject to economic and political risks inherent in maintaining operations
abroad such as economic and political destabilization, land use risks, international conflicts,
restrictive actions by foreign governments, and adverse foreign tax laws. In addition to
economic and political risk, a risk associated with our European manufacturing operations is the
higher relative expense and length of time required to adjust manufacturing employment
capacity. We also face political risks in the U.S., including tax or regulatory risks or potential
adverse impacts from legislative impasses over, or significant legislative, regulatory or
executive changes in fiscal or monetary policy and other foreign and domestic government
policies, including, but not limited to, trade policies and import/export policies.

Approximately 47% of our sales during 2017 were outside the U.S. Other than the U.S.
dollar, the principal currencies to which we are exposed through our manufacturing operations,
sales, and related cash holdings are the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the
Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar, the British pound, and
the Brazilian real. Generally, we have revenues and costs in the same currency, thereby
reducing our overall currency risk, although any realignment of our manufacturing capacity
among our global facilities could alter this balance. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against
other currencies, the results of our non-U.S. operations are translated at a lower exchange rate
and thus into lower reported revenues and earnings.

**Changes in tax laws may adversely affect our financial position.**

On December 22, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Act”) was signed into law. The
Act significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Act,
among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional
limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the immediate expensing of capital
expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a worldwide system of taxation to a
territorial system and imposes several other changes to tax law on U.S. corporations. As many
of the provisions of the Act do not come into effect until 2018 and further clarification of the law
is expected, the total impact on our financial position is uncertain and could be materially
adverse.

In addition, many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries
and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are
actively considering changes to existing tax laws. If tax laws and related regulations change, our
financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible
changes and their potential interdependency, it is possible such changes could adversely impact
our financial results.

**We may experience significant variability in our quarterly and annual effective tax rate which**
**would affect our reported net income.**

We have a complex tax profile due to the global nature of our operations, which encompass
multiple taxing jurisdictions. Variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international
activities, identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties, changes in tax laws and rates,
and the extent to which we are able to realize net operating loss and other carryforwards included

17


-----

in deferred tax assets and avoid potential adverse outcomes included in deferred tax liabilities,
among other matters, may significantly affect our effective income tax rate in the future.

Our effective income tax rate is the result of the income tax rates in the various countries in
which we do business. Our mix of income and losses in these jurisdictions affects our effective
tax rate. For example, relatively more income in higher tax rate jurisdictions would increase our
effective tax rate and thus lower our net income. Similarly, if we generate losses in tax
jurisdictions for which no benefits are available, our effective income tax rate will increase. Our
effective income tax rate may also be impacted by the recognition of discrete income tax items,
such as required adjustments to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions or our deferred tax
asset valuation allowance. A significant increase in our effective income tax rate could have a
material adverse impact on our earnings.

Of our $561.1 million cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2017, $184.7
million was held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. The Act included a one-time
transition tax of unremitted foreign earnings, and accordingly, we recorded preliminary tax
expense related to the transition tax on the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of all our
foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.

**The increased influence of chief information officers and similar high-level executives may**
**negatively impact demand for our products.**

As a result of the increasing interconnectivity of a wide variety of systems, chief information
officers and similar executives are becoming more heavily involved in operation areas that have
not historically been associated with information technology. As a result, CIOs and IT
departments are exercising increased influence over the procurement and purchasing process
at the expense of engineers, plant managers and operation personnel that have historically
driven demand for many of our products. When making purchasing decisions, CIO’s often value
interoperability, standardization, cloud-readiness and security over domain expertise and niche
application knowledge. As a result of the increasing influences of CIOs and IT departments, we
may face increased competition from IT-industry companies that have not traditionally had
major presences in the markets in which we operate. Further, the variance in considerations that
drive purchasing decisions between CIOs and those with niche application expertise may result
in increased competition based on price and a reduction in demand for our products.

**Potential problems with our information systems could interfere with our business and**
**operations.**

We rely on our information systems and those of third parties for storing proprietary
company information about our products and intellectual property, as well as for processing
customer orders, manufacturing and shipping products, billing our customers, tracking
inventory, supporting accounting functions and financial statement preparation, paying our
employees, and otherwise running our business. Any disruption, whether from hackers or other
sources, in our information systems or those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have
a significant impact on our business. In addition, we may need to enhance our information
systems to provide additional capabilities and functionality. The implementation of new
information systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of
an enterprise. Any disruptions affecting our ability to accurately report our financial
performance on a timely basis could adversely affect our business in a number of respects. If we
are unable to successfully implement potential future information systems enhancements, our
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.

18


-----

We, and others on our behalf, store “personally identifiable information” (“PII”) with
respect to employees, vendors, customers, and others. While we have implemented safeguards
to protect the privacy of this information, it is possible that hackers or others might obtain this
information. If that occurs, in addition to having to take potentially costly remedial action, we
also may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, and reputational damage.

**We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during the**
**year ended December 31, 2017, and any inability to remediate such material weakness may**
**affect our ability to report our financial results accurately.**

We are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any
material weaknesses in such internal controls. As disclosed in “Controls and Procedures” under
Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our
management concluded that a control deficiency with respect to recognition of revenue within
our Grass Valley business unit prior to the satisfaction of revenue recognition criteria
constituted a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. Failure to
successfully remediate such material weakness may adversely affect the accuracy and timing of
financial statements related to the Grass Valley business unit.

**Perceived failure of our signal transmission solutions to provide expected results may result in**
**negative publicity and harm our business and operating results.**

Our customers use our signal transmission solutions in a wide variety of IT systems and
application environments in order to help reduce security vulnerabilities and demonstrate
compliance. Despite our efforts to make clear in our marketing materials and customer
agreements the capabilities and limitations of these products, some customers may incorrectly
view the deployment of such products in their IT infrastructure as a guarantee that there will be
no security breach or policy non-compliance event. As a result, the occurrence of a high profile
security breach, or a failure by one of our customers to pass a regulatory compliance IT audit,
could result in public and customer perception that our solutions are not effective and harm our
business and operating results, even if the occurrence is unrelated to the use of such products
or if the failure is the result of actions or inactions on the part of the customer.

**Our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and**
**may subject us to unanticipated obligations.**

The products, services, or technologies we acquire, license, provide, or develop may
incorporate or use open source software. We monitor and restrict our use of open source
software in an effort to avoid unintended consequences, such as reciprocal license grants,
patent retaliation clauses, and the requirement to license our products at no cost. Nevertheless,
we may be subject to unanticipated obligations regarding our products which incorporate or
use open source software.

**Changes in the price and availability of raw materials we use could be detrimental to our**
**profitability.**

Copper is a significant component of the cost of most of our cable products. Over the past
few years, the prices of metals, particularly copper, have been highly volatile. Prices of other
materials we use, such as polyvinylchloride (PVC) and other plastics derived from petrochemical
feedstocks, have also been volatile. Generally, we have recovered much of the higher cost of

19


-----

raw materials through higher pricing of our finished products. The majority of our products are
sold through distribution, and we manage the pricing of these products through published price
lists which we update from time to time, with new prices typically taking effect a few weeks
after they are announced. Some OEM contracts have provisions for passing through raw
material cost changes, generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months. If we are unable to
raise prices sufficiently to recover our material costs, our earnings could decline. If we raise our
prices but competitors raise their prices less, we may lose sales, and our earnings could decline.
If the price of copper were to decline, we may be compelled to reduce prices to remain
competitive, which could have a negative effect on revenues. While we generally believe the
supply of raw materials (copper, plastics, and other materials) is adequate, we have experienced
instances of limited supply of certain raw materials, resulting in extended lead times and higher
prices. If a supply interruption or shortage of materials were to occur (including due to labor or
political disputes), this could have a negative effect on revenues and earnings.

**Our revenue for any particular period can be difficult to forecast due to the unpredictable**
**timing of large orders.**

Our revenue for any particular period can be difficult to forecast, especially in light of the
challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market
uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or even decline on a
year-over-year basis.

The timing of large orders can have a significant effect on our operating results in the
period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to
predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period
changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to
quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Similarly,
we are often informed by our customers well in advance that such customer intends to place a
large order related to a specific project in a given quarter. Such a customer’s timeline for
execution of the project, and the resulting purchase order, may be unexpectedly delayed to a
future quarter, or cancelled. The frequency of such delays can be difficult to predict. As a result,
it is difficult to precisely forecast revenue and operating results for future quarters.

**Our revenue and profits would likely decline, at least temporarily, if we were to lose a key**
**distributor.**

We rely on several key distributors in marketing our products. Distributors purchase and
carry the products of our competitors along with our products. Our largest distributor, Anixter
International Inc., accounted for 12% of our revenue in 2017 and our top six distributors,
including Anixter, accounted for a total of 23% of our revenue in 2017. If we were to lose one of
these key distributors, our revenue and profits would likely decline, at least temporarily.
Changes in the inventory levels of our products owned and held by our distributors can result in
significant variability in our revenues. Further, certain distributors are allowed to return certain
inventory in exchange for an order of equal or greater value. We have recorded reserves for the
estimated impact of these inventory policies.

Consolidation of our distributors, particularly where the survivor relies more heavily on our
competitors, could adversely impact our revenues and earnings. It could also result in
consolidation of distributor inventory, which would temporarily depress our revenues. We have
also experienced financial failure of distributors from time to time, resulting in our inability to
collect accounts receivable in full. A global economic downturn could cause financial difficulties
(including bankruptcy) for our distributors and other customers, which would adversely affect
our results of operations.

**If we are unable to retain senior management and key employees, our business operations**
**could be adversely affected.**

Our success has been largely dependent on the skills, experience, and efforts of our senior
management and key employees. The loss of any of our senior management or other key
employees, for example sales and product development employees, could have an adverse
effect on us. We may not be able to find qualified replacements for these individuals and the
integration of potential replacements may be disruptive to our business. More broadly, a key
determinant of our success is our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented associates.
While this is one of our strategic priorities, we may not be able to succeed in this regard.

**We might have difficulty protecting our intellectual property from use by competitors, or**
**competitors might accuse us of violating their intellectual property rights.**

Disagreements about patents and other intellectual property rights occur in the markets we
serve. Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of
intellectual property rights against us or against our customers or channel partners for which
we may be liable. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us
to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain products or performing
certain services. We may encounter difficulty enforcing our own intellectual property rights
against third parties, which could result in price erosion or loss of market share.

**We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase our costs**
**and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect our business.**

We are subject to laws and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations
in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect our activities including,
but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions,
quality of services, property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements,
economic sanctions, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation
restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.

Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and
expensive, they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost
of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of
changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the
aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our customers, delay the
introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our
business practices. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our
employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and
procedures.

Specifically with respect to data privacy, the European Commission has approved a data
protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been
finalized and is due to come into force in or around May 2018. The GDPR will include
operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of
the European Union that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and
that will include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries are
considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring
local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and
complexity of delivering our services.

**If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we would be required to recognize**
**charges that would reduce our income.**

Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., goodwill and certain other
intangible assets are not amortized but must be reviewed for possible impairment annually or
more often in certain circumstances if events indicate that the asset values may not be
recoverable. We have incurred significant charges for the impairment of goodwill and other
intangible assets in the past, and we may be required to do so again in future periods if the
underlying value of our business declines. Such a charge would reduce our income without any
change to our underlying cash flows.

**Some of our employees are members of collective bargaining groups, and we might be subject**
**to labor actions that would interrupt our business.**

Some of our employees, primarily outside the U.S., are members of collective bargaining
groups. We believe that our relations with employees are generally good. However, if there
were a dispute with one of these bargaining groups, the affected operations could be
interrupted, resulting in lost revenues, lost profit contribution, and customer dissatisfaction.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from**
**fulfilling our obligations under the notes.**

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have
important consequences to you. For example, it could:

   - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes;

   - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;

   - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to
payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to
fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, research and development
efforts and other general corporate purposes;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
industry in which we operate;

   - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

   - limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and

   - limit our ability to make future acquisitions.

In addition, our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior
subordinated notes, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will, contain
restrictive (and, in the case of the revolving credit agreement, financial) covenants that limit our
ability to engage in activities that may be in our best interests. Our failure to comply with those
covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the
acceleration of all of our debts.

22


-----

**Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur**
**substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial**
**leverage.**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the
future. The terms of the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and our revolving
credit agreement do not, and the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes will not, fully
prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. As of December 31, 2017, on an as adjusted basis
as set forth under “Capitalization,” assuming that all outstanding Tender Offer Notes are
tendered and purchased in the Tender Offers, we would have had no borrowings outstanding
under our revolving credit agreement and $348.6 million in available borrowing base under this
facility. Our borrowing base includes eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and property,
plant, and equipment of certain of our subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the
Netherlands. Any borrowings under our revolving credit agreement will be senior to the notes.
We and our subsidiaries may also, from time to time, opportunistically consider refinancing our
outstanding debt obligations, including those under our revolving credit agreement . If new debt
is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now
face could intensify. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to**
**generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, including our ability to repatriate**
**cash.**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes,
and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development efforts will depend
on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from
operations, that anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on
schedule, that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit agreement, or
that we can obtain alternative financing proceeds in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay
our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to
refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes, on or before maturity. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.

Because a substantial portion of our operations is conducted by foreign subsidiaries, our
cash flow and our ability to service debt, including our and the guarantors’ ability to pay the
interest on and principal of the notes when due may be dependent to a significant extent on
interest payments, cash dividends and distributions and other transfers of cash from our foreign
subsidiaries. In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by
our foreign subsidiaries to us and the guarantors, as applicable, could be subject to taxation or
other restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary
transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdiction in which our
foreign subsidiaries operate. Moreover, payments to us and the guarantors by the foreign
subsidiaries will be contingent upon these subsidiaries’ earnings.

**Your right to receive payments on the notes and the guarantees will be junior to the rights of**
**lenders under our credit facility and to all of our and the guarantors’ other senior indebtedness,**
**including any of our or the guarantors’ future senior debt.**

The notes and the guarantees rank in right of payment behind all of our and the guarantors’
existing and future senior indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit

23


-----

agreement, and will rank junior in right of payment behind all of our and the guarantors’ future
borrowings, except any future indebtedness that expressly provides that it ranks equally or is
junior in right of payment to the notes and the guarantees. See “Description of Notes—
Subordination.” As of December 31, 2017, on an as adjusted basis as set forth under
“Capitalization”, assuming that all outstanding Tender Offer Notes are tendered and purchased
in the Tender Offers, the notes would not be junior to any senior indebtedness but would be
structurally junior to $405.8 million of indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade
payables) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of the same date, on an as adjusted basis as set
forth under “Capitalization,” we would have had no borrowings outstanding under our
revolving credit agreement and $348.6 million in available borrowing base under this facility, all
of which would be senior to the notes.

We and the guarantors may not pay principal, premium, if any, interest or other amounts on
account of the notes or the guarantees in the event of a payment default or certain other
defaults in respect of certain of our senior indebtedness, including debt under the revolving
credit agreement, unless the senior indebtedness has been paid in full or the default has been
cured or waived. In addition, in the event of certain other defaults with respect to the senior
indebtedness, we or the guarantors may not be permitted to pay any amount on account of the
notes or the guarantees for a designated period of time. See “Description of Notes—
Subordination.” Because of the subordination provisions in the notes and the guarantees, in the
event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or a
guarantor, our or the guarantor’s assets will not be available to pay obligations under the notes
or the applicable guarantee until we have, or the guarantor has, made all payments in cash on
its senior indebtedness. Sufficient assets may not remain after all these payments have been
made to make any payments on the notes or the applicable guarantee, including payments of
principal or interest when due. In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or the guarantors, holders of the notes will
participate with trade creditors and all other holders of our and the guarantors’ senior
subordinated indebtedness, as the case may be, in the assets remaining after we and the
guarantors have paid all of the senior indebtedness. However, because the indenture requires
that amounts otherwise payable to holders of the notes in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding be
paid to holders of senior indebtedness instead, holders of the notes may receive less, ratably,
than holders of trade payables or other unsecured, unsubordinated creditors in any such
proceedings. In any of these cases, we and the guarantors may not have sufficient funds to pay
all of our creditors, and holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of senior
indebtedness. See “Description of Notes—Subordination.”

**The notes are not secured by our assets and the lenders under our revolving credit agreement**
**will be entitled to remedies available to a secured lender, which gives them priority over you to**
**collect amounts due to them.**

In addition to being subordinated to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior
debt, the notes and the guarantees are not and will not be secured by any of our or their assets.
Our obligations under our revolving credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of
our and certain of our subsidiaries’ assets. If we become insolvent or are liquidated, or if
payment under the revolving credit agreement or in respect of any other secured indebtedness
is accelerated, the lenders under our revolving credit agreement or holders of other secured
indebtedness will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under
applicable law (in addition to any remedies that may be available under our revolving credit
agreement or documents pertaining to other senior debt). Upon the occurrence of any event of
default under our revolving credit agreement (and even without accelerating the indebtedness
under our revolving credit agreement), the lenders may be able to prohibit the payment of the

24


-----

notes and the guarantees by limiting our ability to access our cash flow or under the
subordination provisions contained in the indenture governing the notes.

**The notes will be structurally junior to indebtedness and other liabilities of our non-guarantor**
**subsidiaries.**

Some but not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their
indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from
the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us.

As of December 31, 2017, the notes were structurally junior to $405.8 million of
indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2017, our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately 35% of
our consolidated total assets and 17% of our consolidated total liabilities, and for the year ended
December 31, 2017 accounted for 45% of our consolidated total revenues, 8% of our
consolidated EBITDA and 11% of our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.

Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no
obligations, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make
any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any
right that we or the guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-guarantor
subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent
rights of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets,
will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade
creditors and holders of debt of that subsidiary.

**U.S. federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void guarantees**
**and require note holders to return payments received from guarantors.**

Under the U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent
transfer laws, a guarantee can be voided, or claims in respect of a guarantee can be
subordinated to all other debts of that guarantor if, among other things, the guarantor, at the
time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee:

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of
such guarantee; and

   - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; or

   - was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

   - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as they mature.

In addition, any payment by that guarantor pursuant to its guarantee can be voided and
required to be returned to the guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the
guarantor.

25


-----

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary
depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer
has occurred. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable
value of all of its assets;

   - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be
required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities,
as they become absolute and mature;

   - or it could not pay its debts as they become due.

On the basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other factors,
we believe that each guarantor, after giving effect to its guarantee of these notes, will not be
insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged and
will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. We cannot
assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations
or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.

**The amount that can be collected under the guarantees will be limited.**

Each of the guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a
particular guarantor without rendering the guarantee, as it relates to that guarantor, voidable.
See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Notes — The notes will be structurally junior to
indebtedness and other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.” In general, the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by a particular guarantor may be less, including significantly
less, than the principal amount of the notes.

**We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer**
**required by the indenture.**

Upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control events, we will be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest and special interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. However,
it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make
the required repurchase of notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit agreement will not
allow such repurchases. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged
recapitalizations, that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a
“change of control” under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes — Repurchase at the Option
of Holders.”

**The trading prices for the notes will be directly affected by many factors, including our credit**
**rating.**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including
us. Any ratings downgrade could adversely affect the trading price of the notes, or the trading
market for the notes, to the extent a trading market for the notes develops. The condition of the
financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are
likely to fluctuate in the future and any fluctuation may impact the trading price of the notes.

26


-----

**Currently, there is no public market for the notes and we do not know if a market will ever**
**develop or, if such a market does develop, whether it will be sustained.**

The notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities laws and we will not offer to exchange the notes in a registered exchange offer. The
notes may not be re- offered or re-sold except pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. See “Notice to
Investors.”

Currently, there is no public market for the notes. We have been advised by certain of the
Initial Purchasers that they intend to make a market in the notes. However, you should be aware
that they are not obligated to make a market in the notes and may discontinue their marketmaking activities at any time without notice. Although application has been made for listing
particulars to be approved by the Irish Stock Exchange and for the notes to be admitted to the
Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market,
we cannot assure you this application will be approved or an active trading market will develop
for the notes, or if one does develop, that it will be liquid. If a market were to develop, the notes
could trade at prices that are lower than the initial offering prices depending on many factors,
including prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions and our financial condition,
performance and prospects. Accordingly, a liquid market may not develop for the notes, you
may not be able to sell your notes at a particular time and the prices you receive when you sell
the notes may not be favorable.

This list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other considerations besides those mentioned
above might cause our actual results to differ from expectations expressed in any forwardlooking statement.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect to receive approximately €344.0 million from this offering (equivalent to
approximately $413.4 million based on the exchange rate of 1.2018 dollars per Euro as of
December 31, 2017), after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discount and estimated offering
expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and cash on hand to fund the
Tender Offers described in “Summary — Recent Developments — Concurrent Tender Offers.”
Assuming all of the Tender Offer Notes are tendered and purchased in the Tender Offers, the
holders of the Tender Offer Notes would receive aggregate cash consideration of $462.2 million
(excluding accrued and unpaid interest as of the settlement date of the Tender Offers and
reflecting an exchange rate of 1.2018 dollars per Euro with respect to the purchase price for the
2023 Notes).

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are holders of our 2023 Notes or 2024
Notes and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering in connection with
the Tender Offers described in “Summary — Recent Developments — Concurrent Tender
Offers.”

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Revolving Credit Agreement Due 2022**

On May 16, 2017, we entered into our revolving credit agreement that provides a $400.0
million multi-currency asset-based revolving credit facility. Subject to borrowing base
availability, the entirety of the commitments are available to us, with $160 million of the
commitments available to the foreign borrowers. The revolving credit agreement is secured by
substantially all of our and certain of our United States, Canada, Germany and Netherlands
subsidiaries’ assets. As of March 2, 2018, our total borrowing base was $334.4 million on a
combined basis. The revolving credit agreement matures in May 2022. Interest on outstanding
borrowings is variable, based upon LIBOR or other similar indices in foreign jurisdictions, plus a
spread that ranges from 1.25% — 1.75%, depending upon our leverage position. Outstanding
borrowings in the U.S. and Canada may also, at our election, be priced on a base rate plus a
spread that ranges from 0.25% — 0.75%, depending on our leverage position. We pay a
commitment fee on the total commitments of 0.250%. In the event that we borrow more than
90% of our combined borrowing base or our borrowing base availability is less than $30.0
million, we are subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.0 to 1.0.

**Senior Subordinated Notes**

**The 2023 Notes**

On March 21, 2013, we issued €300.0 million ($388.2 million at issuance) aggregate principal
amount of 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”). On November 20, 2014,
we issued an additional €200.0 million ($247.5 million at issuance) aggregate principal amount
of the 2023 Notes. In September 2017, we repurchased €300.0 million of the outstanding 2023
Notes. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each
year. Beginning on April 15, 2018, we may redeem some or all of the 2023 Notes at redemption
prices beginning at 102.750% and decreasing to par on April 15, 2021, together with any accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Prior to April 15, 2018, we may redeem some or
all of the 2023 Notes at the “make-whole” redemption price together with any accrued and
unpaid interest. We may be required to offer to repurchase the 2023 Notes at a purchase price of
101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date,
in the event of a change of control as defined by the indenture governing the 2023 Notes.

We intend to use the proceeds of this offering together with cash on hand to retire the 2023
Notes as described under “Summary — Recent Developments — Concurrent Tender Offers.”

**The 2024 Notes**

31


-----

The indentures governing the 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027
Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our

make investments or other restricted payments;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - dispose of assets or issue stock of restricted subsidiaries;

   - create liens on assets; or

   - effect a consolidation or merger or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets.

These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

The notes offered pursuant to this offering memorandum (the “Notes”) will be issued
pursuant to an Indenture (the “Indenture”), among the Company, the Guarantors, and Deutsche
Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The following summary of the material
provisions of the Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Indenture, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We
urge you to read the Indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as
Holders. The definitions of certain terms used in the following summary are set forth below
under "— Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this summary, (i) the term “Company” refers
only to Belden Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries and (ii) the terms “we,” “our” and “us”
refer to the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

**Brief Description of Notes**

The Notes will be

   - general unsecured obligations of the Company;

   - subordinated in right of payment to the prior repayment in full in cash of all existing and
future Senior Debt; and

   - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior subordinated_
Indebtedness of the Company, including the Company’s 3.375% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2027, 4.125% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026, 2.875% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2025, 5.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 and 5.5%
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 (the “Existing Subordinated Notes”).

As of December 31, 2017, on an as adjusted basis as described under “Capitalization,” we
would have had approximately $1,562.3 million of debt outstanding, and we would have had
available to borrow approximately $348.6 million under our revolving credit agreement, net of
outstanding letters of credit. The Indenture permits the incurrence of substantial additional
indebtedness by the Company and its subsidiaries, under the Credit Agreement or otherwise, in
the future. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Notes — Despite current indebtedness
levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could
further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.”

33


-----

**Guarantees**

The Notes will be guaranteed by each existing and future Domestic Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company that guarantees Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement. The
Guarantors will jointly and severally guarantee on a senior subordinated basis the Company’s
obligations under the Indenture and Notes. Each Note Guarantee will rank as a general
unsecured senior subordinated obligation of such Guarantor. The obligations of each Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Note Guarantee from
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. Each Note
Guarantee will be

   - a general unsecured obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

   - subordinated in right of payment to the prior repayment in full in cash of all existing and
future Senior Debt of such Guarantor; and

   - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior subordinated_
Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Existing
Subordinated Notes.

Each Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to the Company or
another Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company without limitation, or with
other Persons upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See "— Certain
Covenants — Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets.” A Guarantor will be released from its
Note Guarantee without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder:

(1) if all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor are sold or otherwise disposed
of (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or
after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
and such transaction does not violate the covenant described below under the caption
"— Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Asset Sales”;

(2) if we designate such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
covenant described below under the caption "— Certain Covenants — Restricted
Payments”;

(3) if we consummate a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture following which such
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company;

(4) if such Guarantor no longer guarantees Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit
Agreement, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(5) if we exercise our legal defeasance option or our covenant defeasance option as
described below under the caption "— Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

At our request and expense, the Trustee will execute and deliver any instrument evidencing
such release. A Guarantor may also be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee in
connection with a permitted amendment. See "— Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

As of the date of the Indenture, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted
Subsidiaries.” Under certain circumstances, the Company will be able to designate Subsidiaries
as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries are not subject to many of the restrictive
covenants set forth in the Indenture and do not guarantee the Notes.

The Company’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries, Foreign Subsidiaries or other Restricted
Subsidiaries that do not guarantee Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement

34


-----

will not guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade
creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those subsidiaries generally will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries over the claims of
creditors of the Company, including Holders of the Notes. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to
the Notes — The notes will be structurally junior to indebtedness and other liabilities of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries.”

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

An aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to €350.0 million is being issued in this
offering. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2028. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate
of 3.875% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and
September 15, commencing on September 15, 2018, to Holders of record on the immediately
preceding March 1 and September 1. An unlimited amount of additional Notes may be issued
from time to time after the Issue Date, subject to the provisions of the Indenture described
below under the caption "— Certain Covenants — Incurrence of Indebtedness.” The Notes and
any additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date
to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original
issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months. The Notes will be issued in registered form in denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Only registered holders of the Notes will be treated as
Holders for purposes of the Indenture.

**Listing of the Notes**

The Company has applied through an Irish listing agent for the Notes to be admitted to the
Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes for trading on the Global
Exchange Market of that exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the
Notes will be approved, and placement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Company will maintain one or more paying agents (each a “Paying Agent”) for the
Notes. Principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or
agency of the Paying Agent or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made
by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register
of Holders of Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, in
London.

The Company will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and one or more transfer
agents (each, a “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be Deutsche
Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of definitive registered Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments
on and facilitate transfers of definitive registered Notes on behalf of the Company.

The Company may change the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent without
prior notice to the Holders and the Company or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries may act as
Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent.

35


-----

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules
of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent, Registrar and
Transfer Agent in Ireland. If the Notes are listed on any other securities exchange, the Company
will satisfy any requirement of such securities exchange as to Paying Agents, Registrars and
Transfer Agents. So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange
and the rules of such exchange so require, the Company will publish a notice of any change of
Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Ireland
(currently expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, posted on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange at http://www.ise.ie or otherwise in
accordance with the requirements of the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange.

**Subordination**

The payment of principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Notes and the Guarantees
will be subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt, including Senior
Debt incurred after the date of the Indenture.

The holders of Senior Debt will be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all
Obligations due in respect of Senior Debt (including interest after the commencement of any
bankruptcy proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt, whether or not such
interest is allowed in such proceeding) before the Holders of Notes will be entitled to receive
any payment with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees (except that Holders of Notes may
receive and retain Permitted Junior Securities and payments made from either of the trusts
described under "— Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and "— Satisfaction and
Discharge”), in the event of any distribution to creditors of the Company or any of the
Guarantors:

(1) in a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or any of the Guarantors;

(2) in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating
to the Company or any of the Guarantors or their respective property;

(3) in an assignment for the benefit of creditors of the Company or any of the Guarantors;
or

(4) in any marshaling of the Company’s or any of the Guarantors’ assets and liabilities.

Neither the Company nor any Guarantor may make any payment in respect of the Notes
(except in Permitted Junior Securities or from the trusts described under "— Legal Defeasance
and Covenant Defeasance” and "— Satisfaction and Discharge”) if:

(1) a payment default on any Senior Debt occurs and is continuing beyond any applicable
grace period; or

(2) any other default occurs and is continuing on any series of Designated Senior Debt that
permits holders of that series of Designated Senior Debt to accelerate its maturity and
the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a “Payment Blockage Notice”) from
(i) with respect to Designated Senior Debt arising under the Credit Agreement, the
administrative agent thereunder, or (ii) with respect to any other Designated Senior
Debt, the Representative of such Designated Senior Debt.

36


-----

Payments on the Notes may and will be resumed:

(1) in the case of a payment default, upon the date on which such default is cured or
waived; and

(2) in the case of a nonpayment default, upon the earlier of (i) the date on which such
nonpayment default is cured or waived or, (ii) 179 days after the date on which the
applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received and (iii) the date the Trustee receives
notice from the Representative for such Designated Senior Debt rescinding the
Payment Blockage Notice, unless the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt has been
accelerated.

No new Payment Blockage Notice may be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed
since the delivery of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice irrespective of the number
of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Debt during such period.

No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any
Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee will be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent
Payment Blockage Notice unless such default has been cured or waived for a period of not less
than 90 days.

If the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes receives a payment in respect of the Notes (except
in Permitted Junior Securities or from the trusts described under "— Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance” and "— Satisfaction and Discharge”) when:

(1) the payment is prohibited by these subordination provisions; and

(2) the Trustee has received written notice from the Company or the holders of Senior Debt
at least three Business Days before the payment date or the Holder has actual
knowledge that the payment is prohibited, the Trustee or the Holder, as the case may
be, will hold the payment in trust for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt. Upon the
proper written request of the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee or the Holder, as the
case may be, will deliver the amounts in trust to the holders of Senior Debt or their
proper representative.

The Company must promptly notify holders of Designated Senior Debt if payment on the
Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default.

As a result of the subordination provisions described above, in the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any Guarantor, Holders of Notes may recover
less ratably than creditors of the Company or any of the Guarantors who are holders of Senior
Debt. As a result of the obligation to deliver amounts received in trust to holders of Senior Debt,
Holders of Notes may recover less ratably than trade creditors of the Company or any of the
Guarantors. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Notes — Your right to receive payments
on the notes and the guarantees will be junior to the rights of lenders under our revolving credit
facility and to all of our and the guarantors’ other senior indebtedness, including any of our or
the guarantors’ future senior debt.”

37

**Optional Redemption**

The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions, at the
option of the Company, at any time prior to March 15, 2023, upon not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to, the

interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions, at the
option of the Company, on or after March 15, 2023, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60
days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth
below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed
during the twelve-month period beginning on March 15 of the years indicated below:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time on or prior to March 15, 2021, the Company
may on any one or more occasions redeem Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more
Equity Offerings, at 103.875% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the redemption date, provided that at least 65% of the principal amount of Notes
originally issued on the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately following such redemption
(excluding Notes held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries); and provided, further, that
such redemption shall occur within 120 days of the date of the closing of any such Equity
Offering.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of Notes for
redemption will be made by the Trustee (or the Registrar, as applicable) in compliance with the
requirements of the relevant clearing systems and the principal securities exchange, if any, on
which the Notes are listed, including by pool factor, or, if the Notes are not so listed or there are
no such requirements, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem
fair and appropriate; provided that no definitive Notes of €100,000 or less shall be redeemed in
part. Notices of redemption shall be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60
days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered
address. Notices of redemption may be subject to conditions specified in the notice. If any Note
is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption, subject to satisfaction of any conditions to such redemption specified in the notice
of redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions
of them called for redemption.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, for communication to entitled account holders in substitution of any

mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange or any other securities
exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange,
and to the extent required by the Irish Stock Exchange or such other securities exchange, the
Company will provide a copy of all notices to the Irish Stock Exchange or such other securities
exchange, as applicable, and will publish such notices in a newspaper having general circulation
in Ireland (which is expected to be The Irish Times). In addition, from the date of the listing
particulars relating to the listing of the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange, copies of the
following documents will be available for inspection during usual business hours at the
specified office of the Listing Agent: (a) the Indenture (including the form of Notes); (b) the
organizational documents of the Company and each of the Guarantors and (c) any documents
furnished to the Trustee under the covenant described under the heading "— Certain Covenants
— Reports.”

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

_Change of Control._ Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder of Notes will
have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to €1,000 or an
integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that no Note of less than €100,000 shall
be purchased in part) of such Holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the
“Change of Control Offer”) at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (the
“Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company
will (i) mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the date specified in such notice, which
date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is
mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice and (ii) if at the time of such notice the Notes are listed
on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, cause a notice
of the Change of Control Offer to be published in The Irish Times (or another leading newspaper
of general circulation in Ireland). The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder or under the
laws of Ireland to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will
not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, (i) accept
for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer, (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Company. The Paying
Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment
for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred

39


-----

by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion
of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount
of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will publicly
announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment Date.

If at the time of any such Change of Control, the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock
Exchange or any other securities exchange, to the extent required by the Irish Stock Exchange
or such other securities exchange, the Company will notify the Irish Stock Exchange or such
other securities exchange, as applicable, that a Change of Control has occurred and any relevant
details relating to such Change of Control.

The Credit Agreement limits the Company from purchasing Notes, and also provides that
the occurrence of certain change of control events would constitute a default. Prior to complying
with any of the provisions of this “Change of Control” covenant under the Indenture governing
the Notes, but in any event within 90 days following a Change of Control, to the extent required
to permit the Company to comply with this covenant, the Company will either repay all
outstanding Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or other Indebtedness ranking senior to
or pari passu with the Notes or obtain the requisite consents, if any, under all agreements
governing such outstanding Indebtedness.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Company will have
available funds sufficient to make the Change of Control payment for all the Notes that might be
delivered by Holders seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. The Credit Agreement
contains, and any future agreements relating to other indebtedness to which the Company
becomes a party may contain, restrictions or prohibitions on the Company’s ability to
repurchase Notes or may provide that an occurrence of a Change of Control constitutes an
event of default under, or otherwise requires payments of amounts borrowed under, those
agreements. If a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from
repurchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its then lenders to repurchase
the Notes or could attempt to repay or refinance the Indebtedness containing such prohibitions.
If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay the applicable Indebtedness, it would
remain prohibited from repurchasing the Notes. In that case, failure to repurchase tendered
Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture and may constitute a default
under the terms of the Credit Agreement or other Indebtedness that the Company may enter
into from time to time.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change
of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) notice of redemption has been given
pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption "— Optional Redemption” in
respect of all Notes then outstanding unless and until there is a default in payment of the
applicable redemption price, or (iii) if, in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of
Control, it or a third party has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all
Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment
and has purchased all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the terms
of such Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of
Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the
Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer. Notes repurchased
pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be retired and cancelled.

40


-----

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company,
or any other Person making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described
above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the
Company will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given
not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a
redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent
not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase).

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) any sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than a Lien permitted
by the Indenture and other than by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person or group of
related Persons within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (a “Group”),
(other than any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) (whether or not otherwise in
compliance with the provisions of the Indenture);

(2) the approval by the holders of Capital Interests of the Company of any plan or proposal
for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company (whether or not otherwise in
compliance with the provisions of the Indenture); or

(3) the Company becomes aware (whether by any report or any other filing pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) that any
Person or Group shall become the owner, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record,
of shares representing 50% or more of the aggregate ordinary voting power
represented by the issued and outstanding Capital Interests of the Company, other than
any merger or consolidation as a result of which the holders of a majority of the
Company’s Voting Stock (measured by voting power rather than number of shares)
immediately prior to such transaction continue to own at least a majority of the Voting
Stock (measured by voting power rather than number of shares) of the Person
surviving or resulting from such transaction or any parent thereof.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require the
Company to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
another Person or group may be uncertain.

_Asset sales._ The Indenture provides that the Company will not, and will not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration
at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors (or, in the event of Asset Sales for consideration of
less than $50.0 million, by an officer of the Company)) of the assets or Equity Interests
issued or sold or otherwise disposed of (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale); and

41


-----

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such Asset Sale and all other Asset Sales since August 27, 2012 on a
cumulative basis is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents, assets or Capital Interests
described in clauses (2) or (3) of the next succeeding paragraph or a combination
thereof; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most
recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto) of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes,
that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which the Company
and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all creditors in
writing,

(b) securities or other obligations received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of cash received) within 180 days
following the closing of such Asset Sale, and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value,
taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant
to this clause (c) since the Issue Date and not yet converted to cash or Cash
Equivalents, not to exceed 5.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of the
receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall each be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents for purposes of this clause (2) and for no
other purpose.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Net Proceeds:

(1) to repay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor
that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantees);

(2) to acquire a majority of the assets of, or a majority of the voting Capital Interests of,
another Person (or division or business unit thereof); and/or

(3) to make capital expenditures or to acquire other tangible long-term assets, provided
that, prior to the application of the Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale in accordance with
this paragraph, the Company shall be entitled, within 180 days from the date of the
Asset Sale, to apply such Net Proceeds towards the redemption of Equity Interests of
the Company in an amount not to exceed the limitation set forth in clause (9) of the
third paragraph under "— Certain Covenants — Restricted Payments.”

Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily
reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is
not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or
invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess
Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the
Company will be required to make an offer to all Holders of Notes and all holders of other
Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in
the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets
(an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other

42


-----

indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and such other
indebtedness. To the extent that any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset
Sale Offer, the Company may use such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders
thereof and other pari passu Indebtedness described above tendered into such Asset Sale Offer
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the respective aggregate amount of the Notes and
such other Indebtedness to be purchased shall be determined on a pro rata basis, and the
Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased in such aggregate amount on a pro rata basis.
Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at
zero.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the “Asset Sale”
provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the “Asset Sale”
provisions of the Indenture by virtue thereof.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. During any
period of time that (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and
(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant
Suspension Event”) then, the covenants specifically listed below will not be applicable to the
Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) "— Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Asset Sales”;

(2) "— Restricted Payments”;

(3) "— Incurrence of Indebtedness”;

(4) "— Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) clause (4) of the first paragraph of "— Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets”; and

(6) "— Transactions with Affiliates.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company may
not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under
the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date
one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the
rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (a “Reversion Date”), then the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events; it being understood that no actions
taken by (or omissions of) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the

43


-----

suspension period shall constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Suspended
Covenants. Furthermore, after the time of reinstatement of the Suspended Covenants upon such
withdrawal or downgrade, calculations with respect to Restricted Payments will be made in
accordance with the terms of the covenant described below under "— Certain Covenants —
Restricted Payments” as though such covenant had been in effect during the entire period of
time from the Issue Date. In addition, (i) Indebtedness incurred while the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants will be deemed to have
been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant “Incurrence of Indebtedness” and
(ii) Restricted Payments made while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject
to the Suspended Covenants will be deemed to have been made pursuant to the sum of clauses
(c)(i)-(v) of the covenant “Restricted Payments.” There can be no assurance that the Notes will
ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.

The Company shall deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee specifying (i) if a Covenant
Suspension Event has occurred, (ii) if a Reversion Date has occurred and (iii) the dates of
commencement or ending of any Suspension Period. The Trustee shall not have any duty to
monitor whether or not a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date has occurred or if a
Suspension Period has commenced or ended, nor any duty to notify the Holders of any of the
foregoing.

_Restricted Payments._ The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of
the Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without
limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the
Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as
such (other than (i) dividends or distributions accrued or payable in Equity Interests
(other than Disqualified Interests) of the Company or (ii) dividends or distributions to
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company);

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation,
in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company) any Equity
Interests of the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company (other than
any such Equity Interests owned by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company);

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness that is subordinated to the Notes or any
Note Guarantee (other than Indebtedness permitted under clause (6) of the definition of
“Permitted Debt”) except (i) a payment of interest or principal at Stated Maturity or
(ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of any such Indebtedness in
anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final
maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or
other acquisition; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively
referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such
Restricted Payment:

(a) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof;

44


-----

(b) the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro
forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning
of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth
in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under caption "— Incurrence
of Indebtedness;” and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after August 27,
2012 (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1) (provided that at the
time of declaring such dividend, such dividend was counted as a Restricted Payment)
(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) and (15) of the second
succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of

(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as
one accounting period) from April 2, 2012 to the end of the Company’s most
recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are
available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net
Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus

(ii) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including the fair market value of any
property or Capital Interests, received by the Company since August 27, 2012
as a contribution to its equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity
Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Interests) or from the issue or
sale of Disqualified Interests or debt securities of the Company that have been
converted into such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified
Interests or convertible debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Company),
together with the aggregate cash and Cash Equivalents received by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries at the time of such conversion or
exchange plus the amount by which Indebtedness of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries is reduced upon the conversion or exchange
subsequent to August 27, 2012 of any Indebtedness or Disqualified Interests
which are convertible into or exchangeable for Qualified Capital Interests of the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; plus

(iii) 100% of the amount received, including the fair market value of any property
received after August 27, 2012 by means of (i) the sale or other disposition
(other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) of Restricted
Investments made by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and
repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repayments of loans or advances
which constitute Restricted Investments of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries or (ii) the sale (other than to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary) of the Capital Interests of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a
distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the
extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary constituted a Permitted
Investment) or a dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, plus

(iv) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary or the merger or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of assets of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, the fair
market value of the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, (other than an
Unrestricted Subsidiary to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted
Subsidiary constituted a Permitted Investment), plus

45


-----

(v) $141.0 million.

As of March 2, 2018, the amount available for Restricted Payments under the preceding
clause (c) was approximately $980.1 million.

The Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary if such designation would not cause a Default. For purposes of making such
determination, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted
Investments, in the Company’s discretion, at the time of such designation and will reduce the
amount available for Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments, as applicable. All such
outstanding Investments will be deemed to constitute Investments in an amount equal to the
fair market value of such Investments at the time of such designation. Such designation will
only be permitted if such Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments would be permitted at
such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or other distribution or redemption within 60 days after
the date of declaration or call for redemption thereof, if at said date of declaration or
call for redemption such payment would have complied with the provisions of the
Indenture;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds
of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of,
other Equity Interests of the Company (other than any Disqualified Interests) or from a
contribution of capital to the Company; provided that the amount of any such net cash
proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance
or other acquisition shall be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the second preceding
paragraph;

(3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, replacement, extension, renewal, refinancing
or retirement or other acquisition of subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified
Interests in exchange for or with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) the declaration, or payment of any dividend or other distribution by a Subsidiary of the
Company to the holders of its common Equity Interests on a pro rata basis;

(5) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity
Interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company held by any current or
former officer, director, employee, consultant or agent of Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or Heirs or other permitted transferees thereof) upon death,
disability, retirement, severance or termination of employment or service or in
connection with a stock option plan or agreement, shareholders agreement, or similar
agreement, plan or arrangement, including amendments thereto; provided that the
aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity
Interests may not exceed:

(a) $10.0 million in any calendar year, with unused amounts being available to be used
in any later calendar year; provided that such amount in any calendar year may be
increased in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from the sale of Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Interests) of the Company to any officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that occurs
after the date of the Indenture, to the extent such net cash proceeds have not

46


-----

otherwise been applied to make Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (c)(ii) of
the second preceding paragraph; plus

(b) the cash proceeds of “key man” life insurance policies received by the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the date of the Indenture that are used for the
repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value owned by the
individual (or such individual’s estate) that is the subject of such insurance;

(6) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of options,
warrants or other convertible securities to the extent such Equity Interests represent a
portion of the exercise price of those options, warrants or other convertible securities
and cash payments in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares in connection with the
exercise of options, warrants, or other convertible securities;

(7) the declaration and payment of regular quarterly dividends on the Company’s Equity
Interests in accordance with past practice and not to exceed $0.05 per share;

(8) additional Restricted Payments not to exceed $150.0 million after August 27, 2012;

(9) the repurchase of the Company’s Equity Interests in an amount not to exceed $50.0
million after August 27, 2012;

(10) distributions or payments of Securitization Fees and purchases of Securitization Assets
pursuant to a Securitization Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified
Securitization Financing;

(11) any payments made in connection with the consummation of the offering of the Notes
hereby on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum;

(12) payment of intercompany subordinated debt, the incurrence of which was permitted
under clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "—
Incurrence of Indebtedness;”

(13) the purchase of fractional shares by the Company upon conversion of any securities of
the Company into Capital Interests of the Company;

(14) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of subordinated
Indebtedness or Disqualified Interests pursuant to the provisions similar to those
described under the captions “Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Change of
Control” and “Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Asset Sales;” provided that all
Notes tendered by Holders of the Notes in connection with the related Change of
Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, have been repurchased, redeemed or
acquired for value in full; and

(15) payment of dividends on Disqualified Interests of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, the issuance of which is permitted by the Indenture.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on
the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or
issued by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted
Payment. The fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined by an
officer of the Company. In the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than
one of the exceptions described in (1) through (15) above or is entitled to be made pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company may, in its sole discretion, classify, and may
later reclassify from time to time, such Restricted Payment or any portion thereof into or among
any of such applicable provisions.

_Incurrence of Indebtedness._ The Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or

47


-----

otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to
(collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt); provided, however, that the
Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and any of the Company’s Restricted
Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness if, in each case, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred
would have been at least 2.00 to 1, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom but without giving pro forma effect to any Indebtedness
incurred on such date of determination pursuant to the following paragraph), as if the additional
Indebtedness had been incurred, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The provisions of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to the incurrence of any
of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness and
letters of credit (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to
the maximum potential liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
thereunder) under one or more Credit Facilities in an aggregate amount incurred under
this clause (1) not to exceed the greater of (i) $1,100.0 million or (ii) 30% of
Consolidated Total Assets;

(2) Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date;

(3) the incurrence by the Company and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the
Notes and the Note Guarantees issued on the Issue Date;

(4) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness
represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money
obligations, in each case incurred for the purpose of financing all or any of the purchase
price or cost of construction, installation, design, repair or improvement of real or
personal property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary (whether through the direct acquisition of such assets or the
acquisition of Equity Interests of any Person owning such assets) and in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed the greater of (i) $175.0 million or (ii) 5.0% of
Consolidated Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to
extend, redeem, renew, refund, refinance, defease, discharge, replace or retire for value
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the Indenture (other than Indebtedness
permitted under clause (1));

(6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany
Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that
results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a
Subsidiary thereof and (B) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a
Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof shall be
deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by
this clause (6);

(7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging
Obligations that are incurred for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk or,
commodity price risk or currency exchange rate risk, and in any such case not for
speculative purposes;

48


-----

(8) the guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that was permitted to be incurred
by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness being
guaranteed is subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, then the guarantee
shall be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;

(9) Indebtedness consisting of Permitted Investments of the kind described in clauses
(6) and (11) of the definition of “Permitted Investments;”

(10) Indebtedness (i) consisting of indemnification obligations of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial
institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently (except in the case of
daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business;
_provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five business days of_
incurrence;

(11) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness
in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time
outstanding, including all outstanding Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to
refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (11), not
to exceed $175.0 million;

(12) the incurrence by any of the Company’s Foreign Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed, in the aggregate for
all such Foreign Subsidiaries, the greater of (i) $90.0 million and (ii) 2.5% of
Consolidated Total Assets;

(13) Indebtedness incurred by a Securitization Subsidiary in a Qualified Securitization
Financing that is not recourse to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
other than a Securitization Subsidiary (except for Standard Securitization
Undertakings);

(14) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company providing for adjustment of purchase price, deferred payment, earn out or
similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the
disposition or acquisition of any business or assets of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(15) Indebtedness in respect of worker’s compensation claims, health, disability or other
employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance
obligations, bankers’ acceptances, letters of credit (not supporting Indebtedness for
borrowed money), performance, surety, appeal and similar bonds and completion
guarantees or similar obligations provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
in the ordinary course of business;

(16) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to the extent the proceeds
of such Indebtedness are deposited and used to defease the Notes as described under
"— Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or "— Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(17) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of the financing
of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business; and

(18) Indebtedness of a Person incurred and outstanding on or prior to the date on which
such Person was acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company or consolidated or merged with or into the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; provided that
such Indebtedness is not incurred in connection with or in contemplation of, or to

49


-----

provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, such
acquisition or merger; and provided, further, that after giving pro forma effect to such
incurrence of Indebtedness and such acquisition, consolidation or merger (i) the
Company would have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
would be greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such
acquisition.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of
Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (18) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to
divide and classify such item of Indebtedness, (or any portion thereof) on the date of incurrence,
and at any time and from time to time may later reclassify all or any portion of any item of
Indebtedness as having been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or under
any category of Permitted Debt described in clause (1) through (18) above so long as such
Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred pursuant to such provision at the time of
reclassification. Accrual of interest, accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same
terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Interests in the form of additional shares of
the same class of Disqualified Interests for purposes of this covenant shall not be deemed an
incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Interests for purposes of this
covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount is included in Fixed Charges of the
Company as accrued.

Any increase in the United States dollar equivalent of outstanding Indebtedness of the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than United
States dollars resulting from fluctuations in the exchange values of currencies will not be
considered to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of
determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a
foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the
case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a non-U.S. currency, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded
if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing,
such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced.

_Limitation on Senior Subordinated Debt._ The Company will not incur any Indebtedness
that is contractually subordinate in right of payment to any Senior Debt of the Company unless
it is pari passu or subordinate in right of payment to the Notes. No Guarantor will incur any
Indebtedness that is contractually subordinate in right of payment to the Senior Debt of such
Guarantor unless it is pari passu or subordinate in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note
Guarantee. For purposes of the foregoing, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated
in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, as applicable,
solely by reason of any Liens or guarantees arising or created in respect of such other
Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor or by virtue of the fact that the holders of any
secured Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor agreements giving one or more of such
holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them.

50


-----

_Liens._ The Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness on any of their respective
assets now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom, except Permitted
Liens, unless contemporaneously therewith

(1) in the case of any Lien securing Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes or a
Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or such Note
Guarantee, as the case may be, at least equally and ratably with or prior to such
obligation with a Lien on the same collateral; and

(2) in the case of any Lien securing Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or
such Note Guarantee as the case may be, with a Lien on the same collateral that is prior
to the Lien securing such subordinated obligation, in each case, for so long as such
Indebtedness is secured by such Lien (such Lien, “Primary Lien”).

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the immediately
preceding paragraph shall automatically and unconditionally be released and discharged upon
the release and discharge of the Primary Lien, without any further action on the part of any
Person.

_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries._ The Company
will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or
otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Interests or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

under or by reason of:

(a) the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees;

(b) applicable law, rule, regulation, license, permit, order or similar restriction;

(c) any instrument governing Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or Capital
Interests of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness
or Capital Interest was incurred or issued in connection with or in contemplation of
such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person,
or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or
assets of the Person, so acquired, and any amendments, modifications,
restatements, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of
any such agreements or instruments (provided that the amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the
agreements governing such original agreement or instrument); provided that, in
the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the
Indenture to be incurred;

51


-----

(d) non-assignment provisions in leases, contracts, licenses and other agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(e) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of
business and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions of the nature
described in clause (3) above on the property so acquired;

Restricted Subsidiary or an agreement entered into for the sale of specified assets
that restrict the sale of assets, distributions, loans or transfers by that Restricted
Subsidiary pending such sale or other disposition;

(g) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, provided that the restrictions contained in the
agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are no more
materially restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements
governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(h) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint
venture agreements, partnership agreements, limited liability company operating
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale
agreements and other similar agreements, which limitation is applicable only to the
assets that are the subject of such agreements;

(j) restrictions in other Indebtedness incurred in compliance with the covenant
described under the caption "— Incurrence of Indebtedness;”

(k) agreements governing existing Indebtedness and the Credit Agreement as in effect
on the date of the Indenture and any amendments, restatements, modifications,
renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of
those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications,
renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such encumbrances
and restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of the
Indenture;

(l) Liens securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the
covenant described under the caption "— Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to
dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(m) any restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth provisions in leases and
other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(n) with respect to clause (3) of the first paragraph, (i) any such encumbrance or
restriction consisting of customary nonassignment, subletting or transfer
provisions in leases governing leasehold interests to the extent such provisions
restrict the transfer of the lease or the property leased thereunder; and
(ii) encumbrance or restrictions contained in security agreements, pledges or
mortgages securing Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such
restrictions restrict the transfer of the property subject to such security agreements,
pledges or mortgages; and

(o) any encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any amendments, modifications,
restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses
(a) through (m) above; provided that the encumbrances or restrictions in such

52


-----

amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken
as a whole, than the encumbrances or restrictions prior to such amendment,
modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement
or refinancing.

_Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets._ The Company may not consolidate or merge
with or into (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer,
lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or
more related transactions to another Person unless

(1) either (i) the Company is the surviving corporation or (ii) the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which
such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been
made is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership organized or
existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; provided that, in case of a limited liability company or a partnership, a coobligor of the Notes is a corporation;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the
Company) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or
other disposition shall have been made assumes all the obligations of the Company
under the Notes and the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists;
and

(4) either (i) the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
merger (if other than the Company), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition shall have been made, will, at the time of such
transaction and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such transaction had occurred
at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least
$1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set
forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "—
Incurrence of Indebtedness” or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio after giving such
pro forma effect to such transaction is equal to or greater than it is immediately prior to
such transaction or series of transactions.

The predecessor company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the
successor company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Company under the Indenture; provided that in the case of a lease of all its assets,
the predecessor will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on
the Notes.

Except in a transaction in which its Guarantee will be released, no Guarantor may
consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person),
another Person (other than the Company or another Guarantor) whether or not affiliated with
such Guarantor unless:

(1) subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) assumes all the
obligations of such Guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture pursuant to a
supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;
and

53


-----

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default
exists.

This “Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to a merger of the
Company or a Guarantor with an Affiliate solely for the purpose, and with the effect, of
reincorporating the Company or such a Guarantor, as the case may be, in another jurisdiction of
the United States. In addition, nothing in this “Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets”
covenant will prohibit the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating or
amalgamating with, merging with or into or conveying, transferring or leasing, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets to, the Company or
another Restricted Subsidiary.

_Transactions with Affiliates._ The Company will not, and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make
or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee
with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) having
a value in excess of $1.0 million, unless

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an
unrelated Person; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series
of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $25.0
million, a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an Officers’ Certificate
certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above and that such
Affiliate Transaction has either been approved by a majority of the disinterested
members of the Board of Directors or has been approved in an opinion issued by an
accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing as being fair to
the Holders from a financial point of view.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following items shall not be deemed to be Affiliate
Transactions:

(1) any employment agreement or arrangements, consulting, non-competition,
confidentiality, indemnity or similar agreement, incentive compensation plan, benefit
arrangements or plan, severance or expense reimbursement arrangement entered into
by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) transactions between or among the Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3) payment of reasonable directors fees to directors of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company and other reasonable fees, compensation, benefits and
indemnities paid or entered into with directors, officers and employees of the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company;

(4) Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described
above under the caption "— Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments;

(5) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified
Securitization Financing;

(6) the entering into of a registration rights agreement with the stockholders or
debtholders of the Company;

54


-----

(7) the issuance or sale of any Capital Interest (other than Disqualified Interests) of the
Company and the granting of other customary rights in connection therewith;

(8) any agreement as in effect on the Issue Date or any amendments, renewals or
extensions of any such agreement (so long as such amendments, renewals or
extensions are not less favorable to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries) and
the transactions evidenced thereby;

(9) transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company) that
is an Affiliate of the Company solely because the Company owns, directly or through a
Restricted Subsidiary, any Capital Interest in, or controls, such Person; and

(10) transactions in which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an accounting, appraisal or investment
bank firm of national standing stating that such transaction is fair to the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are
not materially less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those
that would have reasonably been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length
basis.

_Subsidiary Guarantees._ If any of the Company’s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries shall
guarantee Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement, then such Subsidiary
shall, within 20 Business Days, become a Guarantor and execute a Supplemental Indenture and
deliver an Opinion of Counsel, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Any such Note
Guarantee shall be subject to the release provisions and other limitations described under "—
Guarantees.”

_Reports._ Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), so long as any Notes are outstanding, the
Company will furnish to the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of Notes (i) all quarterly and
annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with the
Commission on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such Forms,
including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” that describes the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries (showing in reasonable detail, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto and in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the financial condition and results of operations
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company) and, with respect to the annual
information only, a report thereon by the Company’s certified independent accountants and
(ii) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the Commission on Form 8-K if the
Company were required to file such reports, in each case, within the time periods specified in
the Commission’s rules and regulations (together with any extensions granted by the
Commission); provided, however, that if the Commission will accept the filings of the Company,
the Company, at its option, need not furnish such reports to the Trustee to the extent it elects to
file such reports with the Commission; provided further, however, that in no event shall such
reports be required to contain separate financial statements for Guarantors or Subsidiaries that
would be required under Section 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act.

In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Company becomes a
guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this
covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Company by furnishing financial

55


-----

information relating to such parent company; provided that the same is accompanied by
consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the
information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand.

So long as any Notes remain outstanding if the Company is not subject to the reporting
requirements under Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will also:

(1) as promptly as reasonably practicable after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and
quarterly reports required by clause (i) of the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant
or such earlier time after the completion of such reporting period, hold a conference
call to discuss the results of operations for the relevant reporting period; and

(2) issue a press release to the appropriate nationally recognized wire services prior to the
date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with clause (1) of this
paragraph, announcing the time and date of such conference call and either including
all information necessary to access the call.

In addition, the Company and the Guarantors have agreed that, for so long as any Notes
remain outstanding, they will furnish to the Holders, upon their request, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Company will also make available copies of all reports required by the first paragraph
of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted
for trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, at the offices of the
Paying Agent in Ireland or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such
reports on the website of the Company (www.belden.com).

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture provides that each of the following constitutes an Event of Default:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes;

(2) default in payment when due of the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes
(whether or not the payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions of the
Indenture);

(3) a default by the Company or any Guarantor in the observance or performance of any
other covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture which default continues for a
period of 60 days (or 120 days in the case of the covenant described under "— Certain
Covenants — Reports”) after the Company or such Guarantor receives written notice
specifying the default (and demanding that such default be remedied and stating that
such notice is a “Notice of Default”) from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of
the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (except in the case of a default with
respect to the “Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets” covenant, which will
constitute an Event of Default with such notice requirement but without such passage
of time requirement);

(4) the failure to pay at final maturity (giving effect to any applicable grace periods and any
extensions thereof) the principal amount of any Indebtedness for money borrowed of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or the acceleration of the
final stated maturity of any such Indebtedness, if the aggregate principal amount of
such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness

56


-----

in default for failure to pay principal at final maturity or which has been accelerated,
aggregates $50.0 million or more at any time and such failure shall not have been cured
or waived or such Indebtedness paid or discharged, in each case within 30 days thereof;

(5) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (to
the extent such judgments are not paid or covered by an insurance carrier or pursuant
to which the Company is not indemnified by a third party who has agreed to honor
such obligation) aggregating in excess of $50.0 million, which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgments have become final
and non-appealable;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries; and

(7) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee shall be held in any judicial
proceeding to be unenforceable or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and
effect or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or
disaffirm its obligation under its Note Guarantee.

If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes shall notify the Company in writing, specifying
the Event of Default, demanding that the Default be remedied and stating that such notice is a
“Notice of Default” following which such Holders may declare all the Notes to be due and
payable immediately. Upon such declaration of acceleration pursuant to a Notice of Default, the
aggregate principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding Notes shall become
due and payable without further action or notice; provided, however, that in the event of a
declaration of acceleration because an Event of Default set forth in clause (4) above has
occurred and is continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically rescinded
and annulled if the failure to pay or acceleration triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (4) shall be remedied or cured or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness
within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or
insolvency with respect to the Company, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding
Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Subject to certain
limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct
the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the
Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding
notice is in their interest. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes
except as provided in the Indenture.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by
notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive, rescind or cancel
any declaration of an existing or past Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the
Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the
principal of, the Notes (other than nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due
solely because of acceleration).

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is
required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee
within 30 days after the occurrence thereof a statement specifying such Default or Event of
Default.

57

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, future or present director, officer, employee, partner, manager, agent, member (or
Person forming any limited liability company), incorporator or stockholder of the Company or
any Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any
Guarantor under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by accepting
a Note and Note Guarantee waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes and Note Guarantee.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations
discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due
from the trust referred to below,

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary
Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held
in trust,

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company’s
obligations in connection therewith, and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of
the Company released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not
constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including (i) nonpayment and (ii) bankruptcy and
insolvency events with respect to the Company) described under "— Events of Default and
Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance,

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or another entity designated for
such purpose for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in Euros, noncallable
Euro-denominated Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts
as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent
investment bank, appraisal firms or public accountants, to pay the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify
whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming
that (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling or (ii) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change
in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding

58


-----

Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee
an opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or
loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will
be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not
occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of
such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of
funds to be applied to such deposit);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the
Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound including, without limitation, the Credit
Agreement;

(6) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the deposit
was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over
the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and

(7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of
counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal
Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar
and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements
and transfer documents and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees
required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company is not required to transfer or
exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Company is not required to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to
surviving rights or registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in
the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when

(1) either

(a) all the Notes theretofore authenticated (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has
theretofore been deposited or segregated and held in trust by the Company and
thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

59


-----

(b) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become
due and payable or (ii) will become due and payable within one year, or are to be
called for redemption within one year, under arrangements reasonable satisfactory
to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name,
and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company has irrevocably deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Trustee or another entity designated for such
purpose funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness
on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (including
principal of, premium, if any, and interest ) together with irrevocable instructions
from the Company directing the Trustee to apply such funds to the payment
thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(2) the Company has paid all other sums payable under the Indenture by the Company;
and

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of
counsel stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes or the
Note Guarantees may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes); provided, that without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver
may not (with respect to any Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions
with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the
covenants described above under the caption "— Repurchase at the Option of Holders”

90 days or resign.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any
remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that if an
Event of Default shall occur (which has not been cured), the Trustee will be required, in the
exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of such
person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to

Cash Flow attributable to the assets which are the subject of the Asset Acquisition or

forma basis, (i) interest on outstanding Indebtedness determined on a fluctuating basis as of the
FCCR Transaction Date and which will continue to be so determined thereafter shall be deemed
to have accrued at a fixed rate per annum equal to the rate of interest on such Indebtedness in
effect on the FCCR Transaction Date; (ii) if interest on any Indebtedness actually incurred on the
FCCR Transaction Date may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of
a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rates, then the interest

69

rate in effect on the FCCR Transaction Date will be deemed to have been in effect during the
four-quarter period; and (iii) notwithstanding clause (i) above, interest on Indebtedness

to interest rate swaps, caps or collars, shall be deemed to accrue at the rate per annum resulting

determination. Whenever the compliance with any provision of, or the default provisions or
definitions in, the Indenture refer to an amount in U.S. dollars, that amount will be deemed to
refer to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of any obligation or sum denominated in any other
currency or currencies, including composite currencies, which was in effect on the date of
incurring, expending, remitting or otherwise initially incurring or expending such amount, or in
the case of revolving credit obligations, on the date first committed, or otherwise as expressly
provided in the Indenture, and, in any case, no subsequent change in the U.S. Dollar Equivalent
after the applicable date of determination will cause such determination to be modified.

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Rule 144A Global Note”). Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the
Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
account of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the “Rule 144A Book Entry Interests”)
and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book Entry
Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book Entry Interests, the “Book Entry Interests”) will
be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold
interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global
Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective
names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, Book Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing
limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book Entry Interests. In addition,
while the notes are in global form, holders of Book Entry Interests will not be considered the
owners or “holders” of notes for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or the nominee
of their common depositary), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global
Notes for all purposes under the Indenture (as defined herein). In addition, participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book
Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of notes under the
Indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee (each as defined herein) will have any responsibility, or
be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes (as defined below):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue
to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within
120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered
through Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default (as defined herein) and
commencement of enforcement action under the Indenture.

81


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book
Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to
request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued notes in definitive registered form to all
owners of Book Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar (as defined herein) will issue Definitive Registered Notes,
registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or
on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their
respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the relevant Indenture, unless that legend is
not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer and the Trustee each shall be entitled to treat the
registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable
for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such
registration is a means of evidencing title to the notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the notes; however,
owners of the Book Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the
maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book Entry Interests in such
Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global
Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of
the notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate, provided, however, that no Book Entry
Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes
(including principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the common
depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The
Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature, except as may be required by law. The Issuer expects that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book
Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined herein) and the
Trustee will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or

82


-----

the common depositary’s nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments
and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any
of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book Entry Interest or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book
Entry Interest;

   - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

   - the records of the common depositary.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect
of, the Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such notes through Euroclear or
Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted
to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described
above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents
or waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is
an Event of Default under the notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of
the notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in
certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance
with Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a
holder of notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,
including to sell notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or
to pledge such securities, such holder of notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in
accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to Investors.” Book
Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and
certification requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A
Book Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Regulation S Book Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written

83


-----

certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if
available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Rule 144A Book Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A under the Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of
any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book Entry Interest for
a Rule 144A Book Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in
the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the
principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book Entry Interests in a
Global Note only as described under “Description of Notes — Transfer and Exchange” and, if
required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

Any Book Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be a Book Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book Entry Interest
in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it remains such a Book Entry Interest.

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations
and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the
settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time.
None of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various
services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface
with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and
certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

84


-----

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act
on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial
interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear
and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited
by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that
certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability
to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial
interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to
the Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book Entry System**

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to the Official List
of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in
the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures,
and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any
Guarantor or the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear,
Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the
rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the notes will be made in euro. Book Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and
will settle in same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is
important to establish at the time of trading of any Book Entry Interests where both the
purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the
desired value date.

85


-----

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

Because the following restrictions will apply, purchasers are advised to consult legal
counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the notes. We do not
intend to file a registration statement to register resales of the notes under the Securities Act or
offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act.

None of the notes has been registered under the Securities Act and they may not be offered
or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only (A) to persons
reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A promulgated
under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) (“QIBs”) in compliance with Rule 144A and (B) outside
the United States to persons other than U.S. persons (“non-U.S. purchasers,” which term shall
include dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a discretionary
basis for non-U.S. beneficial owners (other than an estate or trust)) in reliance upon Regulation
S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). As used herein, the terms “United States” and
“U.S. person” have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of notes from the Initial Purchasers, by its acceptance thereof, will be
deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

(1) It is not an “affiliate,” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, of us, or acting on
our behalf, it is purchasing the notes for its own account or an account with respect to
which it exercises sole investment discretion and that it and any such account is either
(A) a QIB, and is aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) a
non-U.S. purchaser that is outside the United States (or a non-U.S. purchaser that is a
dealer or other fiduciary as referred to above);

(2) It acknowledges that the notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities
Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons except as set forth below;

(3) It shall not resell or otherwise transfer any of such notes within one year after the
original issuance of the notes except (A) to us or any of our subsidiaries, (B) inside the
United States to a QIB in a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) outside the
United States in an offshore transaction in compliance with Rule 904 under the
Securities Act (if available), (D) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by
Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available) or (E) in accordance with another
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (and based upon an
opinion of counsel if we so request);

(4) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the notes notice of any
restrictions on transfer of such notes;

(5) The purchaser confirms that:

(a) such purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters, that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the
notes, and such purchaser and any accounts for which it is acting are each able to
bear the economic risks of its or their investment,

(b) such purchaser is not acquiring the notes with a view towards any distribution
thereof in a transaction that would violate the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any state of the United States or any other applicable jurisdictions; provided that
the disposition of its property and the property of any accounts for which such
purchaser is acting as fiduciary shall remain at all times within its control; and

86


-----

(c) such purchaser has received a copy of the offering memorandum and
acknowledges that such purchaser has had access to such financial and other
information, and has been afforded the opportunity to ask such questions to our
representatives and those of the guarantors and receive answers thereto, as it
deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase the notes;

(6) It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of
beneficial interests in a note in global form (in each case other than pursuant to an
effective registration statement) the holder of notes or the holder of beneficial interests
in a global note, as the case may be, may be required to provide certifications and other
documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and submit such certifications
and other documentation as provided in the indenture;

(7) It understands that all of the notes will bear a legend substantially to the following
effect unless otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof;

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion summarizes certain United States federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to the acquisition, owning and disposition of the notes. This
discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, judicial authority and administrative interpretations, all as of the date
of this document, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or are
subject to different interpretations. We cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described in this discussion, and
we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel
with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of
the notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who purchase the notes in this offering for cash at a
price equal to the issue price of the notes (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of
the notes is sold for cash other than to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the notes
as capital assets (generally property held for investment). This discussion does not address any
U.S. federal tax considerations other than U.S. federal income tax considerations (such as estate
and gift tax considerations), the Medicare tax on net investment income, or the tax
considerations arising under the laws of any foreign, state, local or other jurisdiction or any
income tax treaty. In addition, this discussion does not address all tax considerations that may
be important to a particular holder in light of the holder’s circumstances, or to certain categories
of investors that may be subject to special rules, such as:

   - dealers in securities or currencies;

   - traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their
securities;

   - U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

   - Non-U.S. holders (as defined below) that have a “tax home” in the United States;

   - U.S. holders who hold notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary;

   - persons holding notes as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other “synthetic
security” or integrated transaction;

   - persons who purchase notes in this offering and who sell Tender Offer Notes pursuant
to the Tender Offers;

   - former U.S. citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

   - financial institutions;

   - insurance companies;

   - regulated investment companies;

   - real estate investment trusts;

   - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;

   - entities that are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

   - partnerships and other pass-through entities and holders of interests therein.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
holds notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will
depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership, and certain

90


-----

determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships considering an investment
in the notes and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the
particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the
notes.

Under recently enacted legislation, U.S. holders that use an accrual method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be required to include certain amounts in income no
later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. Although the
precise application of this rule is unclear at this time, it may require the accrual of income earlier
than would be the case under the general tax rules described below. U.S. holders that use an
accrual method of accounting are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential
applicability of this legislation to their particular situation.

INVESTORS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF NOTES ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR
OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL
TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN JURISDICTION OR
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.

**Certain Additional Payments**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes — Optional Redemption” and
“Description of Notes — Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Change of Control”), we may
be obligated to pay amounts on the notes that are in excess of stated interest or principal on the
notes. These potential payments may implicate the provisions of the U.S. Treasury regulations
relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” We do not intend to treat the possibility of
paying such additional amounts as causing the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. It is possible that the IRS may take a different position, in which case, if such
position is sustained, a holder might be required to accrue ordinary interest income at a higher
rate than the stated interest rate and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any
gain realized on the taxable disposition of the notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes
that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent
payment debt instrument rules to the notes.

**U.S. Tax Consequences to U.S. holders**

The following summary will apply to you if you are a U.S. holder of the notes. You are a
“U.S. holder” for purposes of this discussion if you are a beneficial owner of a note and you are
for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

   - an individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;

   - a corporation that was created or organized in or under the laws of the United States,
any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

   - a trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S.
court and that has one or more United States persons (as defined in section 7701(A)(30)
of the Code) that have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or
(2) that has made a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be
treated as a United States person.

**Interest on the Notes**

Interest on the notes generally will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is
received or accrued in accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

If you are a cash method taxpayer, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar
value of the Euro interest payment based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. You will not
recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but you
may have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the Euros
received.

If you are an accrual method taxpayer, you must accrue interest income on a note in Euros
and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on one of two methods. Under the first
method, you accrue interest income on the note in Euros and translate the amount accrued into
U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or,
if that period spans two taxable years, during the portion of the interest accrual period in the
relevant taxable year). The average exchange rate for an accrual period (or partial period) is the
simple average rate for each business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the
period reasonably derived and consistently applied by you. Under the second method, you may
elect to accrue interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period
(or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more
than one taxable year), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if such date is
within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. If you make an election under the
second method above, you must apply that method consistently to all debt instruments from
year to year and you cannot change the election without the consent of the IRS. When interest is
actually paid, you will generally recognize currency exchange gain or loss, taxable as ordinary
income or loss from sources within the United States, equal to the difference between (i) the
value of the Euros received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate on the
date of receipt, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to
such payment.

**Disposition of the Notes**

You will generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, redemption, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a note equal to the difference, if any, between the
proceeds you receive (excluding any proceeds attributable to accrued but unpaid interest which
will be taxable as ordinary interest income to the extent you have not previously included such
amounts in income) and your adjusted tax basis in the notes. Subject to the discussion below,
the proceeds you receive generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received calculated
at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the note
generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price on the date of purchase
calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However, if the notes are traded on an
established securities market and you are a cash method U.S. holder (or an electing accrual
method U.S. holder), you will determine your adjusted tax basis and amount realized by using
the spot rate of exchange in effect on the settlement date of the purchase or disposition, as the
case may be. This special election available to an accrual method U.S. holder in regard to the
purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market must be applied
consistently by such U.S. holder to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS.

92


-----

Subject to the rules applicable to foreign currency exchange gain or loss (described below),
any gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the note for more than one
year at the time of the sale, redemption, exchange, retirement or other disposition. Long-term
capital gains of individuals, estates and trusts currently are subject to a reduced rate of U.S.
federal income tax. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.

You will generally recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the disposition of a note to the
extent the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received for the note, based on a spot rate at the time
you dispose of the note (or the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date, if applicable), is
greater or less than the U.S. dollar value of the Euros paid for the note, based on the spot rate at
the time you acquired the note (or the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date, if
applicable). Any resulting foreign currency gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss. You will
only recognize such foreign currency gain or loss (along with any foreign currency gain or loss
recognized with respect to the accrued but unpaid interest) to the extent you have gain or loss,
respectively, on the overall disposition of the note.

**Transactions in Euros**

Euros received as interest on, or on a disposition of, a note will have an adjusted tax basis
equal to their U.S. dollar value at the time such interest is received or at the time such proceeds
are received. You will generally recognize gain or loss on a sale, or other taxable disposition of
such Euros equal to the difference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market
value in U.S. dollars of other property received in such sale or other taxable disposition, and
(ii) your adjusted tax basis in such Euros. As discussed above, if the notes are traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (or an electing accrual-basis U.S. holder)
will determine the U.S. dollar value of the Euros by translating the Euros received at the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date of the sale or other taxable disposition. Accordingly, the
amount realized and your adjusted tax basis in the Euros received would be equal to the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date.

Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale or other disposition of Euros generally will be
ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense.

**Tax Return Disclosure Requirement**

Treasury regulations that apply to ‘‘reportable transactions’’ require the reporting of certain
transactions to the IRS based on any of several indicia, including the recognition of foreign
currency and certain other losses in excess of a threshold amount. You are urged to consult
your own tax advisors regarding these rules, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement) and significant penalties for noncompliance.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Information reporting generally will apply to payments of interest on, and the proceeds of
the sale, exchange or other disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of, notes held by
you, and backup withholding will also generally apply to such payments unless you provide the
applicable withholding agent with a taxpayer identification number, certified under penalties of
perjury, as well as certain other information or otherwise establish an exemption from backup
withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld under the
backup withholding rules is allowable as a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, if
any, and a refund may be obtained from the IRS if the amounts withheld exceed your actual
U.S. federal income tax liability and you timely provide the required information and
appropriate claim form to the IRS.

93


-----

**U.S. Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

The following summary will apply to you if you are a non-U.S. holder of notes. You are a
“non-U.S. holder” for purposes of this discussion if you are a beneficial owner of notes that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and that is not a
U.S. holder.

**Interest on the Notes**

Subject to the discussions below regarding backup withholding and FATCA (as defined
below), payments to you of interest on the notes generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax and will be exempt from withholding of U.S. federal income tax under the “portfolio
interest” exemption if you properly certify as to your foreign status, as described below, and:

   - you do not own, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;

   - you are not a “controlled foreign corporation” that is related to us (actually or
constructively);

   - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is in connection with an
extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary
course of your trade or business; and

   - interest on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or
business.

The portfolio interest exemption and several of the special rules for non-U.S. holders
described below generally apply only if you also appropriately certify as to your foreign status.
You can generally meet this certification requirement by providing a properly executed IRS
Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form) to the applicable
withholding agent. If you hold the notes through a financial institution or other agent acting on
your behalf, you may be required to provide appropriate certifications to the agent. Your agent
will then generally be required to provide appropriate certifications to the applicable
withholding agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. Special rules apply to foreign
partnerships, estates and trusts, and in certain circumstances certifications as to the foreign
status of partners, trust owners or beneficiaries may have to be provided to the applicable
withholding agent. In addition, special rules apply to qualified intermediaries that enter into
withholding agreements with the IRS.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you
will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless (i) you provide the
applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BENE (or other applicable or successor form) claiming an exemption from (or a reduction of)
withholding under the benefits of an income tax treaty, or (ii) the payments of such interest are
effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (See "—
Income or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business”).

94


-----

**Disposition of the Notes**

Subject to the discussions below regarding backup withholding and FATCA, you generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the sale, redemption,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note unless:

   - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by you of a U.S. trade or business
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is treated as attributable to a
permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States); or

   - you are an individual who has been present in the United States for 183 days or more in
the taxable year of disposition and certain other requirements are met.

If you are a non-U.S. holder whose gain is described in the first bullet point above, you
generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner described under "— Income
or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business.” If you are a non-U.S. holder
described in the second bullet point above, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income
tax at a flat rate of 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) on the gain derived from the
sale or other disposition, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses. To the
extent that any portion of the amount realized on a sale, redemption, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a note is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on the note, this
amount generally will be taxed in the same manner as described above in "— Interest on the
Notes.”

**Income or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business**

If any interest on the notes or gain from the sale, redemption, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of the notes is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted
by you, then the interest income or gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular
graduated income tax rates generally in the same manner as if you were a U.S. holder unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. Effectively connected interest income will not
be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides
otherwise) if you satisfy certain certification requirements by providing to the applicable
withholding agent a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form). In addition, if you
are a corporation, that portion of your earnings and profits that is effectively connected with
your U.S. trade or business may also be subject to a “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate, unless
an applicable income tax treaty provides for a lower rate. For this purpose, interest received on
a note and gain recognized on the disposition of a note will be included in earnings and profits if
the interest or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by you of a U.S. trade or business.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Payments to you of interest on a note, and amounts withheld from such payments, if any,
generally will be required to be reported to the IRS and to you. Copies of the information returns
reporting such interest payments and withholding may also be made available to the tax
authorities of the country in which you reside or are established under the provisions of a
specific treaty or agreement.

Backup withholding generally will not apply to payments to you of interest on a note if the
certification described in "— U.S. Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders — Interest on the
Notes” is duly provided or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Payment of the proceeds from the disposition of a note effected by the U.S. office of a U.S.
or foreign broker will be subject to information reporting requirements and backup withholding

95


-----

unless you properly certify under penalties of perjury as to your foreign status on IRS Form W8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form) and certain other
conditions are met or you otherwise establish an exemption. Information reporting
requirements and backup withholding generally will not apply to any payment from the
proceeds of the disposition of a note effected outside the United States by a foreign office of a
broker. However, unless such a broker has documentary evidence in its records that you are a
non-U.S. holder and certain other conditions are met, or you otherwise establish an exemption,
information reporting will apply to a payment of the proceeds of the disposition of a note
effected outside the United States by such a broker if it has certain relationships with the United
States.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld under the backup
withholding rules is allowable as a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, if any,
and a refund may be obtained from the IRS if the amounts withheld exceed your actual U.S.
federal income tax liability and you timely provide the required information and appropriate
claim form to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations and
administrative guidance issued thereunder (referred to as “FATCA”) impose a 30% U.S. federal
withholding tax on payments of interest on the notes and on the gross proceeds from the sale
or other disposition of the notes (if such sale or other disposition occurs after December 31,
2018), if paid to a “foreign financial institution” or a “non-financial foreign entity” (each as
defined in the Code) (including, in some cases, when such foreign financial institution or nonfinancial foreign entity is acting as an intermediary), unless: (i) in the case of a foreign financial
institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on
certain payments, and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information
regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt
holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S.
owners); (ii) in the case of a non-financial foreign entity, such entity certifies that it does not
have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or provides the
withholding agent with a certification identifying its direct and indirect substantial United States
owners (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN-E); or (iii) the foreign financial institution
or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules and
provides appropriate documentation (such as an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). Foreign financial
institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United
States with respect to these rules may be subject to different rules. Under certain
circumstances, a beneficial owner of notes might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the effects of FATCA on your investment in
the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition and
holding of the notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement
accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or employee
benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church
plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of
ERISA) or other plans that are not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but
may be subject to provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or
regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar
Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any
such plan, account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

This summary is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code (and related regulations
and administrative and judicial interpretations) as of the date of this offering memorandum.
This summary does not purport to be complete, and no assurance can be given that future
legislation, court decisions, regulations, rulings or pronouncements will not significantly modify
the requirements summarized below. Any of these changes may be retroactive and may thereby
apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. This discussion
is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor should it be construed as
investment or legal advice.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject
to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain
transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties.
Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control
over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to an ERISA
Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes with a portion of the assets of any Plan, a
fiduciary should consider the Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and
circumstances of the investment and determine (i) whether the acquisition and holding of a note
is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code, or any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan,
including, without limitation the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws, (ii) whether in
the future there may be no market in which to sell or otherwise dispose of the notes, and
(iii) whether the acquisition or holding of the notes will constitute a “prohibited transaction”
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (please see discussion under
“Prohibited Transaction Issues” below).

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in
interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified
person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and
other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA

97


-----

Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by an ERISA
Plan with respect to which the issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or a guarantor is considered a party
in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment
is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class
exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited
transactions resulting from the sale, acquisition or holding of the notes. These class exemptions
include, without limitation, PTCE 75-1, respecting certain transactions involving employee
benefit plans and broker-dealers, reporting dealers and banks; PTCE 84-14, as amended,
respecting certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset
managers; PTCE 90-1, respecting certain investments by insurance company pooled separate
accounts; PTCE 91-38, respecting certain investments by bank collective investment funds; PTCE
95-60, respecting certain life insurance company general accounts; and PTCE 96-23, respecting
certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of
ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code each provide relief from the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that
(i) neither the issuer of the notes nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises
any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets
of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and (ii) the ERISA Plan pays no more than
adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of these statutory exemptions
and PTCEs contain conditions and limitations on their application and do not provide relief from
the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the
conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by
these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited
transactions. Accordingly, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or
holding the notes in reliance on any of these, or any other exemptions, should carefully review
the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and
we do not provide any, assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be
available with respect to the acquisition or holding of the notes, or that all of the conditions of
any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing
“plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition and holding will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar
Laws.

Due to the complexity of these rules and the excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may
be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly
important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering acquiring and/or holding the notes on
behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and
whether an exemption would be applicable to the acquisition and holding of the notes.
Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their acquisition and
holding of the notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not
violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. The sale
of the notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or
representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

We, our subsidiary guarantors and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase
agreement dated March 6, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”) relating to the offering and sale of
the notes. In the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have severally agreed to purchase
from us and we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, the entire principal amount of the
notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for
and accept delivery of the notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain
legal opinions. If the Initial Purchasers take any of the notes, they are obligated to take and pay
for all of the notes.

The Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer and sell the notes at the offering price set
forth on the front cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering of the notes, the
price at which the notes are being offered may be changed at any time without notice. Certain of
the Initial Purchasers may make offers and sales of the notes in the United States through their
respective affiliates. One or more of the Initial Purchasers may sell through affiliates or
appropriately licensed entities for sales of the notes in jurisdictions in which they are otherwise
not prohibited.

The notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities laws and we will not offer to exchange the notes in a registered exchange offer. The
notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of
U.S. persons, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. We have
been advised by the Initial Purchasers that they propose to resell the notes to (a) persons they
reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act or (b) outside the United States to certain persons in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” In connection with sales outside the United
States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or
for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as part of their distribution at any time or
(2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering and the date
the notes were originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they
sell notes during such period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on
offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons. As used in this paragraph, the terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given
to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

We have agreed with the Initial Purchasers that we will not offer or issue any other debt
securities substantially similar to the notes from the date hereof through the date that is 60 days
after the date hereof without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.
We will indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, or will contribute to payments that the several Initial Purchasers may
be required to make in respect of any such liabilities.

Currently, there is no public market for the notes. The Initial Purchasers have advised us
that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws; however, they
are not obligated to make a market in the notes and may discontinue such market-making
activities at any time without providing any notice. In addition, such market-making activities
will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly,
no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of any trading market for the notes. Although an

application will be made for the notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market, we cannot assure you this
application will be approved or that an active trading market will develop for the notes, or if one
does develop, that it will be liquid.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the Initial Purchasers may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the
Initial Purchasers may bid for and purchase notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the
notes. The Initial Purchasers may also overallot in connection with the offering of the notes,
creating a syndicate short position and may bid for and purchase notes in the open market to
cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Initial Purchasers may bid for and purchase
the notes in market-making transactions. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the
market price of the notes above independent market levels that might otherwise prevail. The
Initial Purchasers are not required to engage in any of these activities, and may end any of them
at any time.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions
engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment
banking, cash management, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal
investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities
and services. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, and
may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the issuer and to persons and entities
with relationships with the issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and
expenses. The Initial Purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the
Purchase Agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the notes pursuant to this
offering memorandum. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates act as agents and/or
lenders under our revolving credit agreement. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates
are holders of our 2023 Notes or 2024 Notes and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the
proceeds of this offering in connection with the Tender Offers.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array
of investments including serving as counterparties to certain derivative and hedging
agreements, and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit
default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of
their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets,
securities and/or instruments of the issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or
otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the issuer. The Initial Purchasers
and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment
recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent
research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold or
recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets,
securities and instruments.

Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who
wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date
will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+6, to specify an
alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement.
Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their
own advisor.

**MIFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturer, the target
market assessment in respect of the notes described in this offering memorandum has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such notes is persons satisfying the criteria of the
definition of “eligible counterparties” or “professional clients” only, each as defined in Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such notes to such
persons are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of such notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRIIPS Regulation / Prohibition on Sales to European Economic Area Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPS Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

Each Initial Purchaser has acknowledged and agreed that:

(a) (i) it is a person whose ordinary activities involve it in acquiring, holding, managing or
disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of its business and
(ii) it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell the notes other than to persons
whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of
investments (as principal or as agent) for the purposes of their businesses or who it is
reasonable to expect will acquire, hold, manage or dispose of investments (as principal
or agent) for the purposes of their businesses where the issue of the notes would
otherwise constitute a contravention of Section 19 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) by the issuer;

(b) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or
cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the
issue or sale of the notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to the issuer or the guarantors; and

(c) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect
anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap.571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules

and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the notes may be issued or may be in
the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or

whom is an accredited investor; or (b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor)
whose sole purpose is to hold investments and each beneficiary is an accredited investor,
shares, debentures and units of shares and debentures of that corporation or the beneficiaries’
rights and interest in that trust shall not be transferable for 6 months after that corporation or
that trust has acquired the notes under Section 275 except: (1) to an institutional investor under
Section 274 of the SFA or to a relevant person, or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A), and
