Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update such forward-looking statements following the date of this offering memorandum. For a description of these risks, please read our risk factors set forth in this offering memorandum and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. Additional factors that may cause actual results to differ from our expectations include: the lack of certainty as to the duration and magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 and the economic recovery from that impact; the impact of a challenging global economy or a downturn in served markets; disruptions in the Company’s information systems including due to cyber-attacks leading to exposures of personally identifiable information; changes in tax laws and variability in the Company’s quarterly and annual effective tax rates; the cost and availability of raw materials including copper, plastic compounds, electronic components, and other materials; the inability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms; the competitiveness of the global markets in which we operate; difficulty ----- in forecasting revenue due to the unpredictable timing of orders related to customer projects as well as the impacts of channel inventory; the presence of substitute products in the marketplace; the increased prevalence of cloud computing; the inability of the Company to develop and introduce new products and competitive responses to our products; the increased influence of chief information officers on purchasing decisions; the inability to execute and realize the expected benefits from strategic initiatives (including revenue growth, cost control, and productivity improvement programs); the inability to achieve our strategic priorities in emerging markets; the inability to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions in furtherance of the Company’s strategic plan; foreign and domestic political, economic and other uncertainties, including changes in currency exchange rates; the impact of changes in global tariffs and trade agreements; volatility in credit and foreign exchange markets; the presence of activists proposing certain actions by the Company; perceived or actual product failures; risks related to the use of open source software; disruption of, or changes in, the Company’s key distribution channels; the inability of the Company to develop and introduce new products and competitive responses to our products; the inability to retain senior management and key employees; assertions that the Company violates the intellectual property of others and the ownership of intellectual property by competitors and others that prevents the use of that intellectual property by the Company; risks related to the use of open source software; the impact of regulatory requirements and other legal compliance issues; the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and the resulting impact on financial performance; disruptions and increased costs attendant to collective bargaining groups and other labor matters; and other factors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2888,IN THE UNITED STATES,2888.11,Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,2888.11.1,,"SEC rules regulate the use in filings with the SEC of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as free cash flow, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, which are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities, adjusted for capital expenditures net of the proceeds from the disposal of tangible assets. We define EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before net interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus certain items, such as asset impairments; accelerated depreciation expense due to plant consolidation activities; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value and transaction costs; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; gains (losses) recognized on the disposal of businesses and tangible assets; amortization of intangible assets; gains (losses) on debt extinguishment; certain revenues and gains (losses) from patent settlements; discontinued operations; and other costs. We do not adjust for ongoing operating expenses. We adjust for the items listed in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements. We utilize the non-GAAP results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of the adjustments and for comparison to budgeted operating results. We believe the non-GAAP results are useful to investors because such results help investors compare our financial performance to previous periods and provide insights into underlying trends in the business and how management oversees our business operations on a day-to-day basis. As an example, we adjust for the purchase accounting effect of recording deferred revenue at fair value in order to reflect the revenues that would have otherwise been recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities. We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the underlying performance of acquired companies. Similarly, we adjust for other acquisition related expenses, such as amortization of intangibles and other impacts of fair value adjustments because they are not related to the acquired entity’s core business performance. As an additional example, we exclude the costs of restructuring programs, which can occur from time to time for our current businesses and/or recently acquired businesses. We exclude the costs of these programs from our Adjusted EBITDA to allow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of the programs, provides valuable insight. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operating activities, and other statement of operations or cash flows data prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity or profitability. Our measurements of free ----- cash flow, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from those of other companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to those of other companies.

Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only in conjunction with financial measures reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus certain items, such as asset impairments; accelerated depreciation expense due to plant consolidation activities; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value and transaction costs; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; gains (losses) recognized on the disposal of businesses and tangible assets; amortization of intangible assets; gains (losses) on debt extinguishment; certain revenues and gains (losses) from patent settlements; discontinued operations; and other costs. We do not adjust for ongoing operating expenses. We adjust for the items listed in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements. We utilize the non-GAAP results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of the adjustments and for comparison to budgeted operating results. We believe the non-GAAP results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide insights into underlying trends in the business and how management oversees our business operations on a day-to-day basis. As an example, we adjust for the purchase accounting effect of recording deferred revenue at fair value in order to reflect the revenues and gross profit that would have otherwise been recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities. We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the underlying performance of acquired companies. Similarly, we adjust for other acquisition related expenses, such as amortization of intangibles and other impacts of fair value adjustments because they are not related to the acquired entity’s core business performance. As an additional example, we exclude the costs of restructuring programs, which can occur from time to time for our current businesses and/or recently acquired businesses. We exclude the costs of these programs from our Adjusted EBITDA to allow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of the programs, provides valuable insight.

The widespread health crisis is adversely affecting the broader economies, financial markets and overall demand environment for many of our products. Our operations and the operations of our suppliers, channel partners and customers have been disrupted to varying degrees by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which are not within our control. Many governments have imposed, and may yet impose, a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of people in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and likely will continue to have, an impact on the attendance and productivity of our employees, and those of our channel partners or customers, resulting in negative impacts to our results of operations and overall financial performance. Additionally, COVID-19 has resulted, and likely will continue to result, in delays in non-residential construction, non-crisis-related IT purchases and project completion schedules in general, all of which can negatively impact our results in both current and future periods. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic or any future epidemic or pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the effects of measures enacted by policy makers and central banks around the globe, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, channel partners and suppliers.

Price erosion may occur through competitors becoming more aggressive in pricing practices. A challenging global economy could also make it difficult for our customers, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Our customers could also face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could have an adverse effect on our results if such events cause reductions in revenues, delays in collection, or write-offs of receivables. Further, the demand for many of our products is economically sensitive and will vary with general economic activity, trends in nonresidential construction, investment in manufacturing facilities and automation, demand for information technology equipment, and other economic factors. Global economic uncertainty could result in a significant decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which could result in a significant adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations; could make it difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future ----- business activities; and could cause our customers to slow or reduce spending on our products and services. Economic uncertainty could also arise from fiscal policy changes in the countries in which we operate. Changes in foreign currency rates and commodity prices can impact the buying power of our customers. For example, a strengthened U.S. dollar can result in relative price increases for our products for customers outside of the U.S., which can have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations. Furthermore, customers’ ability to invest in capital expenditures, such as our products, can depend upon proceeds from commodities, such as oil and gas markets. A decline in energy prices, therefore, can have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Potential cyber security incidents could interfere with our business and operations.,13.3.1,,"Computer hacking, malware, phishing, and spamming attacks against online networking platforms have become more prevalent. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific attack or interruption, such events could also be expensive to remedy, harm our reputation or brands, and/or lead users to lose trust and confidence in our business. We, and others on our behalf, also store “personally identifiable information” (“PII”) with respect to employees, vendors, customers, and others. While we have implemented safeguards to protect the privacy of this information, it is possible that hackers or others might obtain this information in the future, as occurred in November 2020. Based upon this occurrence or any future occurrence, in addition to having to take potentially costly remedial action, we may also be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, and reputational damage. Furthermore, we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for storing proprietary company information about our products and intellectual property, as well as for processing customer orders, manufacturing and shipping products, billing our customers, tracking inventory, supporting accounting functions and financial statement preparation, paying our employees, and otherwise running our business. In addition, we may need to enhance our information systems to provide additional capabilities and functionality. The implementation of new information systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise. Any disruptions affecting our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis could adversely affect our business in a number of respects. If we are unable to successfully implement potential future information systems enhancements, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Changes in tax laws may adversely affect our financial position.,13.4.1,,"We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. If tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is possible such changes could adversely impact our financial results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,We may experience significant variability in our quarterly and annual effective tax rate which would affect our reported net income.,13.5.1,,"We have a complex tax profile due to the global nature of our operations, which encompass multiple taxing jurisdictions. Variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities, ----- identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties, changes in tax laws and rates, and the extent to which we are able to realize net operating loss and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets and avoid potential adverse outcomes included in deferred tax liabilities, among other matters, may significantly affect our effective income tax rate in the future. Our effective income tax rate is the result of the income tax rates in the various countries in which we do business. Our mix of income and losses in these jurisdictions affects our effective tax rate. For example, relatively more income in higher tax rate jurisdictions would increase our effective tax rate and thus lower our net income. Similarly, if we generate losses in tax jurisdictions for which no benefits are available; our effective income tax rate will increase. Our effective income tax rate may also be impacted by the recognition of discrete income tax items, such as required adjustments to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions or our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. A significant increase in our effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our earnings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,Changes in the price and availability of raw materials we use could be detrimental to our profitability.,13.6.1,,"Copper is a significant component of the cost of most of our cable products. Over the past few years, the prices of metals, particularly copper, have been volatile. Prices of other materials we use, such as polyvinylchloride (PVC) and other plastics derived from petrochemical feedstocks, have also been volatile. Generally, we have recovered much of the higher cost of raw materials through higher pricing of our finished products. The majority of our products are sold through distribution, and we manage the pricing of these products through published price lists which we update from time to time, with new prices typically taking effect a few weeks after they are announced. Some OEM contracts have provisions for passing through raw material cost changes, generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months. Especially during periods of inflation, if we are unable to raise prices timely and sufficiently to recover our material costs, our earnings could decline. If we raise our prices but competitors raise their prices less, we may lose sales, and our earnings could decline. If the price of copper were to decline, we may be compelled to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could have a negative effect on revenues. While we generally believe the supply of raw materials (copper, plastics, and other materials) is adequate, we have experienced instances of limited supply of certain raw materials, resulting in extended lead times and higher prices. If a supply interruption or shortage of materials were to occur (including due to labor or political disputes), this could have a negative effect on revenues and earnings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.,13.7.1,,"Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. A regional health crises, like the Coronavirus, could lead to quarantines or labor shortages, thus impacting the output of key suppliers. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,The global markets in which we operate are highly competitive.,13.8.1,,"We face competition from other manufacturers for each of our global business platforms and in each of our geographic regions. These companies compete on technical features, quality, availability, price, ----- customer support and distribution coverage. Some multinational competitors have greater engineering, financial, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we have. Actions that may be taken by competitors, including pricing, business alliances, new product introductions, intellectual property advantages, market penetration, and other actions, could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability. Moreover, some competitors that are highly leveraged both financially and operationally could become more aggressive in their pricing of products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.9,Our revenue for any particular period can be difficult to forecast.,13.9.1,,"Our revenue for any particular period can be difficult to forecast, especially in light of the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or even decline on a year-over-year basis. Changes in market growth rates can have a significant effect on our operating results. The timing of orders for customer projects can also have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the products are shipped and recognized as revenue. The timing of such projects is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such projects may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Similarly, we are often informed by our customers well in advance that such customer intends to place an order related to a specific project in a given quarter. Such a customer’s timeline for execution of the project, and the resulting purchase order, may be unexpectedly delayed to a future quarter, or cancelled. The frequency of such delays can be difficult to predict. As a result, it is difficult to precisely forecast revenue and operating results for future quarters. In addition, our revenue can be difficult to forecast due to unexpected changes in the level of our products held as inventory by our channel partners and customers. Our channel partners and customers purchase and hold our products in their inventory in order to meet the service and on-time delivery requirements of their customers. As our channel partners and customers change the level of Belden products owned and held in their inventory, our revenue is impacted. As we are dependent upon our channel partners and customers to provide us with information regarding the amount of our products that they own and hold in their inventory, unexpected changes can occur and impact our revenue forecast.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.10,The presence of substitute products in the marketplace may reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business.,13.10.1,,"Fiber optic systems are increasingly substitutable for copper based cable systems. Customers may shift demand to fiber optic systems with greater capabilities than copper based cable systems, leading to a reduction in demand for copper based cable. We may not be able to offset the effects of a reduction in demand for our copper-based cable systems with an increase in demand for our existing fiber optic systems. Further, the supply chain in the fiber market is highly constrained, with a small number of vertically integrated firms controlling critical inputs and the related intellectual property. Similarly, in our non-cable businesses, customers could rapidly shift the methods by which they capture and transmit signals in ways that could lead to decreased demand for our current or future products. These factors, either together or in isolation, may negatively impact revenue and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.11,The increased prevalence of cloud computing and other disruptive business models may negatively impact certain aspects of our business.,13.11.1,,"The nature in which many of our products are purchased or used is evolving with the increasing prevalence of cloud computing and other methods of off-premises computing and data storage. This may negatively impact one or more of our businesses in a number of ways, including: - Consolidation of procurement power leading to the commoditization of IT products; - Reduction in the demand for infrastructure products previously used to support on-site data centers; ----- - Lowering barriers to entry for certain markets, leading to new market entrants and enhanced competition; and - Preferences for software as a service billing and pricing models may reduce demand for noncloud “packaged” software.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new products and adapting existing products to meet evolving customer expectations requires high levels of innovation, and the development process may be lengthy and costly. If we are not able to timely anticipate, identify, develop and market products that respond to rapidly changing customer preferences, demand for our products could decline. The relative costs and merits of our solutions could change in the future as various competing technologies address the market opportunities. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products that meet or anticipate technological changes, which will require continued investment in engineering, research and development, capital equipment, marketing, customer service, and technical support. We have long been successful in introducing successive generations of more capable products, but if we were to fail to keep pace with technology or with the products of competitors, we might lose market share and harm our reputation and position as a technology leader in our markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.13,The increased influence of chief information officers and similar high-level executives may negatively impact demand for our products.,13.13.1,,"As a result of the increasing interconnectivity of a wide variety of systems, chief information officers and similar executives are more heavily involved in operation areas that have not historically been associated with information technology. As a result, CIOs and IT departments are exercising influence over the procurement and purchasing process at the expense of engineers, plant managers and operation personnel that have historically driven demand for many of our products. When making purchasing decisions, CIO’s often value interoperability, standardization, cloud-readiness and security over domain expertise and niche application knowledge. As a result of the influences of CIOs and IT departments, we may face increased competition from IT-industry companies that have not traditionally had major presences in the markets in which we operate. Further, the variance in considerations that drive purchasing decisions between CIOs and those with niche application expertise may result in increased competition based on price and a reduction in demand for our products. Alterations to our product mix and go-to-market strategies designed to respond to the changes in the marketplace presented by cloud computing may be disruptive to our business and lead to increase expenses, which may result in lower revenues and profitability. Further, if a competitor is able to more quickly or efficiently adapt, or if cloud computing results in significantly lower barriers to entry and new competitors enter our markets, demand for our products may be reduced.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104

To achieve these goals, our strategic priorities are reliant on our Belden Business System, which includes continuing deployment of our MDS to capture market share through end-user engagement, channel management, outbound marketing, and careful vertical market selection; improving our recruitment and development of talented associates; developing strong global business platforms; acquiring businesses that fit our strategic plan; and continuing to be a leading Lean company. We have a disciplined process for deploying this strategic plan through our associates. There is a risk that we may not be successful in developing or executing these measures to achieve the expected results for a variety of reasons, including market developments, economic conditions, shortcomings in establishing appropriate action plans, or challenges with executing multiple initiatives simultaneously. For example, our MDS initiative may not succeed or we may lose market share due to challenges in choosing the right products to market or the right customers for these products, integrating products of acquired companies into our sales and marketing strategy, or strategically bidding against OEM partners.

The developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks. We may be unable to attract, develop, and retain appropriate talent to manage our businesses in emerging markets. Deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region may adversely affect our operations or financial results. Emerging markets may not meet our growth expectations, and we may be unable to maintain such growth or to balance such growth with financial goals and compliance requirements. Among the risks in emerging market countries are bureaucratic intrusions and delays, contract compliance failures, engrained business partners that do not comply with local or U.S. law, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, fluctuating currencies and interest rates, limitations on the amount and nature of investments, restrictions on permissible forms and structures of investment, unreliable legal and financial infrastructure, regime disruption and political unrest, uncontrolled inflation and commodity prices, fierce local competition by companies with better political connections, and corruption.

The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made will affect our overall growth, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Our ability to acquire businesses successfully will decline if we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition targets consistent with our strategic plan, the competition among potential buyers increases, the cost of acquiring suitable businesses becomes too expensive, or we lack sufficient sources of capital. As a result, we may be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we would like to acquire. Additionally, our strategic plan includes the planned divestiture of certain low-margin cable businesses representing up to $200 million in annual revenues.

We rely on suppliers in many countries, including China. Our foreign operations are subject to economic, social and political risks inherent in maintaining operations abroad such as economic, social and political destabilization, land use risks, international conflicts, pandemics and other health-related crises, restrictive actions by foreign governments, and adverse foreign tax laws. In addition to economic and political risk, a risk associated with our European manufacturing operations is the higher relative expense and length of time required to adjust manufacturing employment capacity. We also face political risks in the U.S., including tax or regulatory risks or potential adverse impacts from legislative impasses over, or significant legislative, regulatory or executive changes in fiscal or monetary policy and other foreign and domestic government policies, including, but not limited to, trade policies and import/export policies. Approximately 45% of our sales during 2020 were outside the U.S. Other than the U.S. dollar, the principal currencies to which we are exposed through our manufacturing operations, sales, and related cash holdings are the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar, the British pound, and the Brazilian real. Generally, we have revenues and costs in the same currency, thereby reducing our overall currency risk, although any realignment of our manufacturing capacity among our global facilities could alter this balance.

If we were to lose one of these key distributors, our revenue and profits would likely decline, at least temporarily. Changes in the inventory levels of our products owned and held by our distributors can result in significant variability in our revenues. Further, certain distributors are allowed to return certain inventory in exchange for an order of equal or greater value. We have recorded reserves for the estimated impact of these inventory policies. Consolidation of our distributors could adversely impact our revenues and earnings. It could also result in consolidation of distributor inventory, which would temporarily depress our revenues.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could: - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes; - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes; - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; - limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and - limit our ability to make future acquisitions. In addition, our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will, contain restrictive (and, in the case of the revolving credit agreement, financial) covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104

Our borrowing base includes eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment of certain of our subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. Any borrowings under our revolving credit agreement will be senior to the notes.

This, to a certain extent, is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule, that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit agreement, or that we can obtain alternative financing proceeds in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Because a substantial portion of our operations is conducted by foreign subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service debt, including our and the guarantors’ ability to pay the interest on and principal of the notes when due may be dependent to a significant extent on interest payments, cash dividends and distributions and other transfers of cash from our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our foreign subsidiaries to us and the guarantors, as applicable, could be subject to taxation or other restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdiction in which our foreign subsidiaries operate.

In addition, in the event of certain other defaults with respect to the senior indebtedness, we or the guarantors may not be permitted to pay any amount on account of the notes or the guarantees for a designated period of time. See “Description of Notes— Subordination.” Because of the subordination provisions in the notes and the guarantees, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or a guarantor, our or the guarantor’s assets will not be available to pay obligations under the notes or the applicable guarantee until we have, or the guarantor has, made all payments in cash on its senior indebtedness.

Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligations, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt of that subsidiary.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104

In addition, any payment by that guarantor pursuant to its guarantee can be voided and required to be returned to the guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. On the basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other factors, we believe that each guarantor, after giving effect to its guarantee of these notes, will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged and will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.

Each Note Guarantee will rank as a general unsecured senior subordinated obligation of such Guarantor. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law.

Each Guarantor may consolidate with or merge into or sell its assets to the Company or another Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company without limitation, or with other Persons upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “— Certain Covenants — Merger, Consolidation, ----- or Sale of Assets.” A Guarantor will be released from its Note Guarantee without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder: (1) if all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor are sold or otherwise disposed of (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and such transaction does not violate the covenant described below under the caption “— Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Asset Sales”; (2) if we designate such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant described below under the caption “— Certain Covenants — Restricted Payments”; (3) if we consummate a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture following which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; (4) if such Guarantor no longer guarantees Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; or (5) if we exercise our legal defeasance option or our covenant defeasance option as described below under the caption “— Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.” At our request and expense, the Trustee will execute and deliver any instrument evidencing such release.

The Company’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries, Foreign Subsidiaries or other Restricted Subsidiaries that do not guarantee Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement will not guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including Holders of the Notes.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder or under the laws of Ireland to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Credit Agreement limits the Company from purchasing Notes, and also provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events would constitute a default. Prior to complying with any of the provisions of this “Change of Control” covenant under the Indenture governing the Notes, but in any event within 90 days following a Change of Control Triggering Event, to the extent required to permit the Company to comply with this covenant, the Company will either repay all outstanding Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or other Indebtedness ranking senior to or pari passu with the Notes or obtain the requisite consents, if any, under all agreements governing such outstanding Indebtedness. If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Company will have available funds sufficient to make the Change of Control Payment for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. The Credit Agreement contains, and any future agreements relating to other indebtedness to which the Company becomes a party may contain, restrictions or prohibitions on the Company’s ability to repurchase Notes or may provide that an occurrence of a Change of Control constitutes an event of default under, or otherwise requires payments of amounts borrowed under, those agreements. If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its then lenders to repurchase the Notes or could attempt to repay or refinance the Indebtedness containing such prohibitions. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay the applicable Indebtedness, it would remain prohibited from repurchasing the Notes. In that case, failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture and may constitute a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or other Indebtedness that the Company may enter into from time to time. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “— Optional Redemption” in respect of all Notes then outstanding unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price, or (iii) if, in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, it or a third party has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the terms of such Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer. Notes repurchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be retired and cancelled. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any other Person making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to ----- the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require the Company to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. _Asset sales.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Net Proceeds: (1) to repay any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantees); ----- (2) to acquire a majority of the assets of, or a majority of the voting Capital Interests of, another Person (or division or business unit thereof); and/or (3) to make capital expenditures or to acquire other tangible long-term assets, provided that, prior to the application of the Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale in accordance with this paragraph, the Company shall be entitled, within 180 days from the date of the Asset Sale, to apply such Net Proceeds towards the redemption of Equity Interests of the Company in an amount not to exceed the limitation set forth in clause (9) of the third paragraph under “— Certain Covenants — Restricted Payments.” Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the Company will be required to make an offer to all Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and such other indebtedness. To the extent that any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof and other pari passu Indebtedness described above tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the respective aggregate amount of the Notes and such other Indebtedness to be purchased shall be determined on a pro rata basis, and the Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased in such aggregate amount on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture by virtue thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104

In addition, (i) Indebtedness incurred while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants will be deemed to have been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant “Incurrence of Indebtedness” and (ii) Restricted Payments made while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants will be deemed to have been made pursuant to the sum of clauses (c)(i)-(v) of the covenant “Restricted Payments.” There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings. The Company shall deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee specifying (i) if a Covenant Suspension Event has occurred, (ii) if a Reversion Date has occurred and (iii) the dates of commencement or ending of any Suspension Period. The Trustee shall not have any duty to monitor whether or not a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date has occurred or if a Suspension Period has commenced or ended, nor any duty to notify the Holders of any of the foregoing. _Restricted Payments. The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,_ directly or indirectly: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than (i) dividends or distributions accrued or payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Interests) of the Company or (ii) dividends or distributions to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company); (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company) any Equity Interests of the Company or any direct or indirect parent of the Company (other than any such Equity Interests owned by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company); (3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness that is subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee (other than Indebtedness permitted under clause (6) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”) except (i) a payment of interest or principal at Stated Maturity or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of any such Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition; or (4) make any Restricted Investment ----- (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment: (a) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; (b) the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under caption “— Incurrence of Indebtedness;” and (c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1) (provided that at the time of declaring such dividend, such dividend was counted as a Restricted Payment) (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) and (15) of the second succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of (i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as one accounting period) from April 4, 2021 to the end of the Company’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus (ii) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including the fair market value of any property or Capital Interests, received by the Company since the Issue Date as a contribution to its equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Interests) or from the issue or sale of Disqualified Interests or debt securities of the Company that have been converted into such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Interests or convertible debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Company), together with the aggregate cash and Cash Equivalents received by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries at the time of such conversion or exchange plus the amount by which Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is reduced upon the conversion or exchange subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness or Disqualified Interests which are convertible into or exchangeable for Qualified Capital Interests of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; plus (iii) 100% of the amount received, including the fair market value of any property received after the Issue Date by means of (i) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) of Restricted Investments made by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repayments of loans or advances which constitute Restricted Investments of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries or (ii) the sale (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the Capital Interests of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary constituted a Permitted Investment) or a dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, plus (iv) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or the merger or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of assets of an Unrestricted ----- Subsidiary to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, the fair market value of the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary constituted a Permitted Investment), plus (v) $860.0 million. The Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if such designation would not cause a Default. For purposes of making such determination, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments, in the Company’s discretion, at the time of such designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments, as applicable. All such outstanding Investments will be deemed to constitute Investments in an amount equal to the fair market value of such Investments at the time of such designation. Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The foregoing provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment of any dividend or other distribution or redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration or call for redemption thereof, if at said date of declaration or call for redemption such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture; (2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of, other Equity Interests of the Company (other than any Disqualified Interests) or from a contribution of capital to the Company; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition shall be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the second preceding paragraph; (3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, replacement, extension, renewal, refinancing or retirement or other acquisition of subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Interests in exchange for or with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; (4) the declaration, or payment of any dividend or other distribution by a Subsidiary of the Company to the holders of its common Equity Interests on a pro rata basis; (5) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company held by any current or former officer, director, employee, consultant or agent of Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or Heirs or other permitted transferees thereof) upon death, disability, retirement, severance or termination of employment or service or in connection with a stock option plan or agreement, shareholders agreement, or similar agreement, plan or arrangement, including amendments thereto; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not exceed: (a) $10.0 million in any calendar year, with unused amounts being available to be used in any later calendar year; provided that such amount in any calendar year may be increased in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Interests) of the Company to any officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that occurs after the date of the Indenture, to the extent such net cash proceeds have not otherwise been applied to make Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (c)(ii) of the second preceding paragraph; plus ----- (b) the cash proceeds of “key man” life insurance policies received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the date of the Indenture that are used for the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value owned by the individual (or such individual’s estate) that is the subject of such insurance; (6) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of options, warrants or other convertible securities to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those options, warrants or other convertible securities and cash payments in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares in connection with the exercise of options, warrants, or other convertible securities;

(11) any payments made in connection with the consummation of the offering of the Notes hereby on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum; (12) payment of intercompany subordinated debt, the incurrence of which was permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “— Incurrence of Indebtedness;” (13) the purchase of fractional shares by the Company upon conversion of any securities of the Company into Capital Interests of the Company; (14) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Interests pursuant to the provisions similar to those described under the captions “Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Change of Control” and “Repurchase at the Option of Holders — Asset Sales;” provided that all Notes tendered by Holders of the Notes in connection with the related Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value in full; and (15) payment of dividends on Disqualified Interests of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, the issuance of which is permitted by the Indenture. The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined by an officer of the Company. In the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the exceptions described in (1) through (15) above or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company may, in its sole discretion, classify, and may later reclassify from time to time, such Restricted Payment or any portion thereof into or among any of such applicable provisions. _Incurrence of Indebtedness. The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted_ Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt); provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and any of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness if, in each ----- case, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 2.00 to 1, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom but without giving pro forma effect to any Indebtedness incurred on such date of determination pursuant to the following paragraph), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period. The provisions of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”): (1) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness and letters of credit (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder) under one or more Credit Facilities in an aggregate amount incurred under this clause (1) not to exceed the greater of (i) $1,100.0 million or (ii) 30% of Consolidated Total Assets; (2) Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date; (3) the incurrence by the Company and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes and the Note Guarantees issued on the Issue Date; (4) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Finance Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case incurred for the purpose of financing all or any of the purchase price or cost of construction, installation, design, repair or improvement of real or personal property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (whether through the direct acquisition of such assets or the acquisition of Equity Interests of any Person owning such assets) and in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (i) $175.0 million or (ii) 5.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at any time outstanding; (5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to extend, redeem, renew, refund, refinance, defease, discharge, replace or retire for value Indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the Indenture (other than Indebtedness permitted under clause (1)); (6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; _provided, however, that (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any_ such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary thereof and (B) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6); (7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are incurred for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk or, commodity price risk or currency exchange rate risk, and in any such case not for speculative purposes; (8) the guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, then the guarantee shall be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed; ----- (9) Indebtedness consisting of Permitted Investments of the kind described in clauses (6) and (11) of the definition of “Permitted Investments;” (10) Indebtedness (i) consisting of indemnification obligations of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently (except in the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of incurrence; (11) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all outstanding Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (11), not to exceed $175.0 million; (12) the incurrence by any of the Company’s Foreign Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed, in the aggregate for all such Foreign Subsidiaries, the greater of (i) $90.0 million and (ii) 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets; (13) Indebtedness incurred by a Securitization Subsidiary in a Qualified Securitization Financing that is not recourse to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than a Securitization Subsidiary (except for Standard Securitization Undertakings); (14) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company providing for adjustment of purchase price, deferred payment, earn out or similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the disposition or acquisition of any business or assets of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; (15) Indebtedness in respect of worker’s compensation claims, health, disability or other employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance obligations, bankers’ acceptances, letters of credit (not supporting Indebtedness for borrowed money), performance, surety, appeal and similar bonds and completion guarantees or similar obligations provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business; (16) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to the extent the proceeds of such Indebtedness are deposited and used to defease the Notes as described under “— Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or “— Satisfaction and Discharge;” (17) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business; and (18) Indebtedness of a Person incurred and outstanding on or prior to the date on which such Person was acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or consolidated or merged with or into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; provided that such Indebtedness is not incurred in connection with or in contemplation of, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, such acquisition or merger; and provided, further, that after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence of Indebtedness and such acquisition, consolidation or merger (i) the Company would have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such acquisition. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (18) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to divide and classify such item of ----- Indebtedness, (or any portion thereof) on the date of incurrence, and at any time and from time to time may later reclassify all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness as having been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or under any category of Permitted Debt described in clause (1) through (18) above so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred pursuant to such provision at the time of reclassification. Accrual of interest, accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Interests in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Interests for purposes of this covenant shall not be deemed an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Interests for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount is included in Fixed Charges of the Company as accrued. Any increase in the United States dollar equivalent of outstanding Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than United States dollars resulting from fluctuations in the exchange values of currencies will not be considered to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollardenominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a non-U.S. currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. _Limitation on Senior Subordinated Debt. The Company will not incur any Indebtedness that is_ contractually subordinate in right of payment to any Senior Debt of the Company unless it is pari passu or subordinate in right of payment to the Notes. No Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinate in right of payment to the Senior Debt of such Guarantor unless it is pari passu or subordinate in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. For purposes of the foregoing, no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, as applicable, solely by reason of any Liens or guarantees arising or created in respect of such other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor or by virtue of the fact that the holders of any secured Indebtedness have entered into intercreditor agreements giving one or more of such holders priority over the other holders in the collateral held by them. _Liens. The Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,_ assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness on any of their respective assets now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom, except Permitted Liens, unless contemporaneously therewith (1) in the case of any Lien securing Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, at least equally and ratably with or prior to such obligation with a Lien on the same collateral; and (2) in the case of any Lien securing Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Notes or such Note Guarantee as the case may be, with a Lien on the same collateral that is prior to the Lien securing such subordinated obligation, in each case, for so long as such Indebtedness is secured by such Lien (such Lien, “Primary Lien”). Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall automatically and unconditionally be released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Primary Lien, without any further action on the part of any Person. ----- _Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will not,_ and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Interests or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries. However, the foregoing restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (a) the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees; (b) applicable law, rule, regulation, license, permit, order or similar restriction; (c) any instrument governing Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or Capital Interests of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or Capital Interest was incurred or issued in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of any such agreements or instruments (provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing such original agreement or instrument); provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred; (d) non-assignment provisions in leases, contracts, licenses and other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business; (e) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Finance Lease Obligations that impose restrictions of the nature described in clause (3) above on the property so acquired; (f) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of Equity Interests or assets of a Restricted Subsidiary or an agreement entered into for the sale of specified assets that restrict the sale of assets, distributions, loans or transfers by that Restricted Subsidiary pending such sale or other disposition; (g) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are no more materially restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced; (h) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, partnership agreements, limited liability company operating agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements; (i) Restrictions in Indebtedness or Capital Interests of Foreign Subsidiaries; ----- (j) restrictions in other Indebtedness incurred in compliance with the covenant described under the caption “— Incurrence of Indebtedness;” (k) agreements governing existing Indebtedness and the Credit Agreement as in effect on the date of the Indenture and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such encumbrances and restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of the Indenture; (l) Liens securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described under the caption “— Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens; (m) any restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth provisions in leases and other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business; (n) with respect to clause (3) of the first paragraph, (i) any such encumbrance or restriction consisting of customary nonassignment, subletting or transfer provisions in leases governing leasehold interests to the extent such provisions restrict the transfer of the lease or the property leased thereunder; and (ii) encumbrance or restrictions contained in security agreements, pledges or mortgages securing Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such restrictions restrict the transfer of the property subject to such security agreements, pledges or mortgages; and (o) any encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (m) above; provided that the encumbrances or restrictions in such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances or restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing. _Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets. The Company may not consolidate or merge with or into_ (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to another Person unless (1) either (i) the Company is the surviving corporation or (ii) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; provided that, in case of a limited liability company or a partnership, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation; (2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made assumes all the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and (4) either (i) the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or ----- other disposition shall have been made, will, at the time of such transaction and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “— Incurrence of Indebtedness” or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio after giving such pro forma effect to such transaction is equal to or greater than it is immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions. The predecessor company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the successor company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture; provided that in the case of a lease of all its assets, the predecessor will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes. Except in a transaction in which its Guarantee will be released, no Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person), another Person (other than the Company or another Guarantor) whether or not affiliated with such Guarantor unless: (1) subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; and (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists. This “Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to a merger of the Company or a Guarantor with an Affiliate solely for the purpose, and with the effect, of reincorporating the Company or such a Guarantor, as the case may be, in another jurisdiction of the United States.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

You will not recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but you may have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the Euros received. If you are an accrual method taxpayer, you must accrue interest income on a note in Euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on one of two methods. Under the first method, you accrue interest income on the note in Euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, if that period spans two taxable years, during the portion of the interest accrual period in the relevant taxable year). The average exchange rate for an accrual period (or partial period) is the simple average rate for each business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derived and consistently applied by you. Under the second method, you may elect to accrue interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable year), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. If you make an election under the second method above, you must apply that method consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and you cannot change the election without the consent of the IRS. When interest is actually paid, you will generally recognize currency exchange gain or loss, taxable as ordinary income or loss from sources within the United States, equal to the difference between (i) the value of the Euros received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate on the date of receipt, and (ii) the U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA withholding below, payments to you of interest on the notes generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax and will be exempt from withholding of U.S. federal income tax under the “portfolio interest” exemption if you properly certify as to your foreign status, as described below, and: - you do not own, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, stock possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; - you are not a “controlled foreign corporation” that is related to us (actually or constructively); - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is in connection with an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of your trade or business; and - interest on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business. The portfolio interest exemption generally applies only if you also appropriately certify as to your foreign status. You can generally meet this certification requirement by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form) to the applicable withholding agent. If you hold the notes through a financial institution or other agent acting on your behalf, ----- you may be required to provide appropriate certifications to the agent. Your agent will then generally be required to provide appropriate certifications to the applicable withholding agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. Special rules apply to foreign partnerships, estates and trusts, and in certain circumstances certifications as to the foreign status of partners, trust owners or beneficiaries may have to be provided to the applicable withholding agent. In addition, special rules apply to qualified intermediaries that enter into withholding agreements with the IRS. If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless (i) you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form) claiming an exemption from (or a reduction of) withholding under the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, or (ii) the payments of such interest are effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States and you meet the certification requirements described below. (See “— Income or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business”). The certifications described above and below must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically.

Subject to the discussion below, the proceeds you receive generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the Euro purchase price on the date of purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However, if the notes are traded on an established securities market and you are a cash method U.S. holder (or an electing accrual method U.S. holder), you will determine your adjusted tax basis and amount realized by using the spot rate of exchange in effect on the settlement date of the purchase or disposition, as the case may be. This special election available to an accrual method U.S. holder in regard to the purchase and sale of notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently by such U.S. holder to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the rules applicable to foreign currency exchange gain or loss (described below), any gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the note for more than one year at the time of the sale, redemption, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. Long-term capital gains of individuals, estates and trusts currently are eligible for reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. The deductibility of capital losses may be subject to limitation. You will generally recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the disposition of a note to the extent the U.S. dollar value of the Euros received for the note, based on a spot rate at the time you dispose of the note, is greater or less than the U.S. dollar value of the Euros paid for the note, based on the spot rate at the time you acquired the note. Any resulting foreign currency gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss. You will only recognize such foreign currency gain or loss (along with any foreign currency gain or loss recognized with respect to the accrued but unpaid interest) to the extent you have gain or loss, respectively, on the overall disposition of the note. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the treatment of capital gains and losses. ----- Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the sale, redemption, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note unless: - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by you of a U.S. trade or business; or - you are an individual who has been present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other requirements are met. If your gain is described in the first bullet point above, you generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner described below under “— Income or Gain Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business.” If you are a non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) on any gain derived from the sale or other disposition, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the notes with a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should consider the Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment and determine (i) whether the acquisition and holding of a note is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, or any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan, including, without limitation the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws, (ii) whether in the future there may be no market in which to sell or otherwise dispose of the notes, and (iii) whether the acquisition or holding of the notes will constitute a “prohibited transaction” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (please see discussion under “Prohibited Transaction Issues” below). Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Company, the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to acquire notes and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision.",N/A,as_expected,2021,104
317,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by an ERISA Plan with ----- respect to which the issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the sale, acquisition or holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 75-1, respecting certain transactions involving employee benefit plans and broker-dealers, reporting dealers and banks; PTCE 84-14, as amended, respecting certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers; PTCE 90-1, respecting certain investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; PTCE 91-38, respecting certain investments by bank collective investment funds; PTCE 95-60, respecting certain life insurance company general accounts; and PTCE 96-23, respecting certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code each provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that (i) neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and (ii) the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of these statutory exemptions and PTCEs contain conditions and limitations on their application and do not provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Accordingly, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on any of these, or any other exemptions, should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers provide any, assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to the acquisition or holding of the notes, or that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. Due to the complexity of these rules and the excise taxes, penalties and liabilities that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering acquiring and/or holding the notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the acquisition and holding of the notes. Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their acquisition and holding of the notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. The sale of the notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by us, the Initial Purchasers or any of our or their respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,104

The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell notes during such period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. As used in this paragraph, the terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act. We have agreed with the Initial Purchasers that we will not offer or issue any other debt securities substantially similar to the notes from the date hereof through the date that is 60 days after the date hereof without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. We will indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or will contribute to payments that the several Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of any such liabilities. Currently, there is no public market for the notes. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws; however, they are not obligated to make a market in the notes and may discontinue such market-making activities at any time without providing any notice.

Specifically, the Initial Purchasers may bid for and purchase notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the notes.
