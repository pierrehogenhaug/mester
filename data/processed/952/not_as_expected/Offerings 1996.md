##### CONDITIONS OF THE BONDS

_The following is the text of the Conditions of the Bonds which (subject to modification) will be endorsed_

_on each Bond in definitive form:_

The £200,000,000 8.75 per cent. Bonds due 2012 (the "Bonds", which expression shall in these

Conditions, unless the context otherwise requires, include any further bonds issued pursuant to
Condition 16 and forming a single series therewith) of Cable and Wireless Public Limited Company (the
"Issuer") are constituted by a Trust Deed dated 26th January, 1996 (the "Trust Deed") made between
the Issuer and Royal Exchange Trust Company Limited (the "Trustee") as trustee for the holders of the

Bonds (the "Bondholders"). The issue of the Bonds was authorised by a resolution of the Board of

Directors of the Issuer passed on 9th January, 1996. The Bonds are, on issue, listed on the London
Stock Exchange Limited (the "London Stock Exchange") and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited
(the "HKSE"). The statements in these Conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed
provisions of and definitions in the Trust Deed. Copies of the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement
dated 26th January, 1996 (the "Agency Agreement") made between the Issuer, the initial paying agents
referred to therein (the "Paying Agents", which expression shall include any additional or other paying
agents appointed pursuant thereto) and the Trustee are available for inspection during normal business
hours by the Bondholders and the holders (the "Couponholders") of the interest coupons appertaining
to the Bonds (the "Coupons") at the principal office for the time being of the Trustee, being at the date
of issue of the Bonds at 155 Bishopsgate, London EC2M 3TG, England, and at the specified office of
each of the Paying Agents. The Bondholders and the Couponholders are entitled to the benefit of, are
bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Agency
Agreement applicable to them.

**1.** **Form, Denomination and Title**

(1) The Bonds are in bearer form, serially numbered, in the denominations of £10,000 and £100,000
each with 17 Coupons attached on issue. Bonds of one denomination cannot be exchanged for Bonds
of the other denomination.

(2) Title to the Bonds and to the Coupons will pass by delivery.

(3) The Issuer, any Paying Agent and the Trustee may (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws)
deem and treat the holder of any Bond and the holder of any Coupon as the absolute owner for all
purposes (whether or not the Bond or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of
ownership or writing on the Bond or Coupon or any notice of previous loss or theft of the Bond or
Coupon).

2. **Status**

The Bonds and the Coupons are direct, unconditional and (subject to the provisions of Condition 9)

unsecured obligations of the Issuer and (subject as aforesaid) rank and will rank pari passu, without any
preference among themselves, with all other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of
the Issuer, present and future, but, in the event of insolvency, only to the extent permitted by applicable
laws relating to creditors' rights.

3. **Interest**

(1) The Bonds bear interest from (and including) 26th January, 1996 at the rate of 8.75 per cent. per
annum, payable annually in arrear on 6th August (each an "Interest Payment Date"), the first payment, in

respect of the period from (and including) 26th January, 1996 to (but excluding) 6th August, 1996, being
made on 6th August, 1996 and amounting to £461.81 per £10,000 principal amount of Bonds.
Each Bond will cease to bear interest from and including its due date for redemption unless, upon due
presentation, payment of the principal in respect of the Bond is improperly withheld or refused or unless
default is otherwise made in respect of payment in which events interest shall continue to accrue as
provided in the Trust Deed.

(2) When interest is required to be calculated in respect of a period of less than a full year, it shall be

calculated on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of 12 months of 30 days each.

**4.** **Payments**

(1) Payments of principal and interest in respect of each Bond will be made against presentation and
surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the Bond, except that payments of
interest due on an Interest Payment Date will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the
case of part payment only, endorsement) of the relevant Coupons, in each case at the specified office
outside the United States of any of the Paying Agents.

(2) Payments will be made, at the option of the holder, by a sterling cheque drawn on a branch of, or by

transfer to a sterling account maintained by the payee with, a bank in the City of London, subject in all

3


-----

cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations applicable in the place of payment, but without
prejudice to the provisions of Condition 6.

(3) Each Bond should be presented for payment together with all relative unmatured Coupons
appertaining thereto. Upon the due date for redemption of any Bond, unmatured Coupons relating to
such Bond (whether or not attached) shall become void and no payment shall be made in respect of
them. If the due date for redemption of any Bond is not an Interest Payment Date, the interest accrued
from the preceding Interest Payment Date or 26th January, 1996, as the case may be, shall be payable
only against presentation of the relevant Bond.

(4) A holder shall be entitled to present a Bond or Coupon for payment only on a Presentation Date and
shall not, except as provided in Condition 3, be entitled to any further interest or other payment if a

Presentation Date is after the due date.

"Presentation Date" means a day which (subject to Condition 7):

(i) is or falls after the relevant due date but, if the due date is not or was not a Business Day in the

City of London, is or falls after the next following such Business Day; and

(ii) is a Business Day in the place of the specified office of the Paying Agent at which the Bond or

Coupon is presented for payment and (unless the second following paragraph applies, in the
case of payment by transfer to a sterling account in the City of London as referred to above) in
the City of London.

"Business Day" means, in relation to any place, a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange
markets settle payments in that place.

If a Bond or Coupon is presented for payment at a time when, as a result of differences in time zones, it
is not practicable to transfer the relevant amount to an account as referred to above for value on the
relevant Presentation Date, the Issuer shall not be obliged so to do but shall be obliged to transfer the
relevant amount to the account for value on the first practicable date after the Presentation Date.

(5) The names of the initial Paying Agents and their initial specified offices are set out at the end of
these Conditions. The Issuer reserves the right, subject to the approval of the Trustee, at any time to
vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent and to appoint additional or other Paying Agents
provided that it will at all times maintain at least two Paying Agents having specified offices in separate
European cities approved by the Trustee, one of which, so long as the Bonds are listed on the London
Stock Exchange, shall be the City of London or such other place as the London Stock Exchange may
approve, and, so long as the Bonds are listed on the HKSE, one Paying Agent having a specified office in

Hong Kong. Notice of any termination or appointment and of any changes in specified offices will be

given to the Bondholders promptly by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 13.

**5.** **Redemption and Purchase**

(1) Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled as otherwise provided in these Conditions,
the Issuer will redeem the Bonds at their nominal amount on 6th August, 2012.

(2) If the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately before the giving of the notice referred to below that
as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the United Kingdom or any
political sub-division of, or any authority in, or of, the United Kingdom having power to tax, or any change
in the application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment
becomes effective after 19th January, 1996, on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the
Bonds the Issuer would be required to pay additional amounts as provided or referred to in Condition 6

the Issuer may at its option (without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph (4) below), having given not

less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 13 (which
notice shall be irrevocable), redeem all, but not some only, of the Bonds at their nominal amount
together with interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption, provided that no notice of
redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days before the earliest date on which the Issuer would be
required to pay the additional amounts were a payment in respect of the Bonds then due. Prior to the
publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee
a certificate signed by two Directors of the Issuer stating that the requirement referred to above will
apply on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Bonds and the Trustee shall be entitled
to accept the certificate as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set out
above, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Bondholders and the Couponholders.

-----

(3) The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Condition 8) may at any time purchase Bonds
(provided that all unmatured Coupons appertaining to the Bonds are purchased with the Bonds) in any
manner and at any price. If purchases are made by tender, tenders must be available to all Bondholders
alike.

(4) Without prejudice to the rights of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries under paragraph (3) above, each

Bond falling due for redemption pursuant to paragraph (2) above, Condition 8 or sub-paragraph (1) (i) or
paragraph (2) of Condition 9 may instead, at the option of the Issuer, be purchased by the Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries without prior notice at a price equal to the principal and accrued interest which would
otherwise be payable in respect of such Bond pursuant to paragraph (6) below, mutatis mutandis in
accordance with Condition 4.

(5) All Bonds which are redeemed will forthwith be cancelled, together with all relative unmatured
Coupons surrendered with the Bonds, and accordingly may not be reissued or resold. Bonds which are
purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to paragraph (3) above may be
held, reissued, resold or surrendered for cancellation, together in each case with all relative unmatured
Coupons. Bonds which are purchased by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to paragraph (4)
above and Coupons surrendered therewith may each be held, reissued or resold to another member of
the Cable and Wireless Group (as defined in Condition 8) or surrendered for cancellation, but may not be
reissued or resold to any person which is not a member of the Cable and Wireless Group.

(6) Upon the expiry of any notice as is referred to in paragraph (2) above, or sub-paragraph (1)(i) or
paragraph (2) of Condition 9, the Issuer shall, subject as provided in paragraph (4} above, be bound to
redeem the Bonds to which the notice refers at their nominal amount together with interest accrued to
but excluding the date of redemption, subject to Condition 3(1).

**6.** **Taxation**

(1) All payments in respect of the Bonds by the Issuer shall be made without withholding or deduction
for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature ("Taxes") imposed or levied by or on behalf of the United Kingdom, or any political sub-
division of, or any authority in, or of, the United Kingdom having power to tax, unless the withholding or
deduction of the Taxes is required by law. In that event, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Bondholders and Couponholders after
the withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts which would have been receivable in
respect of the Bonds or, as the case may be, Coupons in the absence of the withholding or deduction;
except that no additional amounts shall be payable in relation to any payment in respect of any Bond or
Coupon:

(i) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a holder who is liable to the Taxes in respect of the Bond or

Coupon by reason of his having some connection with the United Kingdom other than the
mere holding of the Bond or Coupon; or

(ii) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a holder who would not be liable or subject to the

withholding or deduction by making a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for
exemption to the relevant tax authority; or

(iii) presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that a

holder would have been entitled to additional amounts on presenting the same for payment on
the last day of the period of 30 days; or

(iv) where the Bond or Coupon is presented for payment in the United Kingdom.

(2) In these Conditions, "Relevant Date" means the date on which the payment first becomes due but,
if the full amount of the money payable has not been received in the City of London by the Principal
Paying Agent or the Trustee on or before the due date, it means the date on which, the full amount of

the money having been so received, notice to that effect shall have been duly given to the Bondholders
by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 13.

(3) Any reference in these Conditions to any amounts in respect of the Bonds shall be deemed also to
refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition or under any undertakings
given in addition to, or in substitution for, this Condition pursuant to the Trust Deed.

**7.** **Prescription**

Bonds and Coupons will become void unless presented for payment within periods of 10 years (in the
case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date in respect of the Bonds
or, as the case may be, the Coupons, subject to the provisions of Condition 4.

**8.** **Events of Default**

The Issuer shall be under a duty not to cause or permit the occurrence of any of the events set out

below ("Events of Default"). The Bonds, subject always to the provisos below, shall (without prejudice
to the provisions of Condition 5(4)) become immediately due and repayable at their nominal amount
together with accrued interest (as provided in the Trust Deed) forthwith upon notice from the Trustee to
the Issuer if any of the following events shall occur, thereby breaching such duty, (but only if the Trustee
so determines at its discretion or is requested in writing by Bondholders holding at least one-quarter in
nominal amount of the Bonds then outstanding or is directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the
Bondholders and in every case is indemnified to its satisfaction), that is to say:

(i) the Issuer fails to pay all or any part of the interest due in respect of the Bonds within 10

business days in the City of London of the due date; or

(ii) the Issuer defaults in performance or observance of or compliance with any of its other

undertakings set out in the Bonds or the Trust Deed (other than its undertakings under
Conditions 9(2) and 9(5)) which default is in the opinion of the Trustee incapable of remedy or,
if in the opinion of the Trustee capable of remedy, is not in the opinion of the Trustee remedied
within 60 days (or such longer period as the Trustee may permit) after written notice requiring
remedy of such default shall have been given to the Issuer by the Trustee; or

(iii) (a) any other present or future indebtedness in respect of moneys borrowed or raised of any

one or more of the Issuer and the Principal Subsidiaries becomes due and payable
prematurely by reason of an event of default (however described); or

(b) any such indebtedness is not paid when due or (as the case may be) within any originally

applicable grace period therefor; or

(c) any one or more of the Issuer and the Principal Subsidiaries fails to pay when due or (as

the case may be) within any originally applicable grace period therefor any amount payable
by it under any present or future guarantee or indemnity for any indebtedness in respect
of moneys borrowed or raised; or

(d) any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other encumbrance (each a "Security Interest")

present or future created or assumed by any one or more of the Issuer and the Principal
Subsidiaries becomes enforceable,

save in any such case where there is a bona fide dispute as to whether the relevant
indebtedness or amount claimed under any such guarantee or indemnity is due and payable
and Provided that no such event shall constitute an Event of Default unless the indebtedness,
guarantee, indemnity or amount secured by the Security Interest either alone or when
aggregated with other indebtedness, guarantees, indemnities or amounts secured by Security

Interests falling within sub-paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) above (other than any guarantees,
indemnities and Security Interests relating to indebtedness falling within sub-paragraph (a) or
(b) above, any Security Interests relating to guarantees or indemnities falling within sub-
paragraph (c) above and any indebtedness falling within sub-paragraph (b) above which also
falls within sub-paragraph (a) above) shall comprise or be in respect of an aggregate amount
equal to the higher of £25,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) and an amount
equal to 1 per cent, of Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the Trust Deed) (or its equivalent in any
other currency) and for the purpose of this paragraph (iii) "indebtedness" shall exclude Project

Finance Indebtedness and "Security Interest" shall exclude any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien
or other encumbrance given or assumed solely in relation to Project Finance Indebtedness; or

(iv) a distress or execution or other similar proceeding is levied or enforced or sued out upon or

against the whole or a substantial part of the undertaking or assets of the Issuer or any

Principal Subsidiary and is not discharged or stayed within 75 days (or such longer period as the

Trustee may approve) of having been so levied, enforced or sued out; or

(v) the Issuer or any Principal Subsidiary is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or an

administrative or other receiver or administrator or similar officer is appointed over the whole
or a substantial part of its undertaking or assets or it makes or enters into an assignment or
arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors generally (or any class of its
creditors) or (except, in any case, for the purposes of a reorganisation, reconstruction, union,
transfer, merger or amalgamation effected with the prior written consent of the Trustee, or, in
the case of a Principal Subsidiary, in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of its
business, undertaking and assets to the Issuer or a Subsidiary) ceases to carry on the whole or
substantially the whole of its business Provided that a disposal for full value by the Issuer or
any Principal Subsidiary of the whole or any part of the share capital of a Subsidiary shall be
deemed not to be a cessation for the purposes of this paragraph (v); or

6


-----

(vi) an order is made or an effective resolution is passed for the winding up or dissolution of the

Issuer or any Principal Subsidiary (except, in any case, for the purposes of a reorganisation,
reconstruction, union, transfer, merger or amalgamation effected with the prior written

in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of its business, undertaking and assets
to the Issuer or a Subsidiary); or

(vii) the Issuer fails to comply with its obligations under Conditions 9(2) and 9(5);

PROVIDED that no such event as is mentioned in paragraphs (ii) to (v) (inclusive) and (in relation to the
Issuer or any Principal Subsidiary) (vi) above shall be an Event of Default unless the Trustee shall have

certified that, in its opinion, such event is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders and
PROVIDED FURTHER that no such event as is mentioned in paragraphs (iii) to (vi) (inclusive) in relation
to a Principal Subsidiary shall be an Event of Default or shall be taken into account in determining
whether an Event of Default has occurred under paragraph (iii) if such event also constitutes a Security

Event (as defined in Condition 9) or at any time after a Security Event in relation to such Principal

Subsidiary has occurred.

"Principal Subsidiary" means at any time any Subsidiary of the Issuer (not being an Excluded Subsidiary)
(i) whose profits on ordinary activities before tax and before extraordinary items and any tax relating
thereto or whose net assets (in each case (a) attributable to the Issuer and (b) consolidated in respect of
a Subsidiary which itself has Subsidiaries) all as shown (in the case of any Subsidiary which itself has no
Subsidiaries) in its latest audited accounts and (in the case of a Subsidiary which itself has Subsidiaries)
in the latest unaudited consolidated accounts comprising the audited results of the Subsidiary and its
Subsidiaries represents 10 per cent, or more of the consolidated profits on ordinary activities before tax

substantially all of the business, undertaking or assets of a Subsidiary which immediately prior to such
transfer is a Principal Subsidiary, all as more particularly defined in the Trust Deed. A report by the
Auditors for the time being of the Issuer that in their opinion, on the basis set out in (i) above, a

Subsidiary was or was not as at the date to which or as at which (as the case may be) any audited
consolidated accounts of the Issuer were made up a Principal Subsidiary pursuant to (i) above shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Trustee and all other parties. A
certificate of two Authorised Signatories (as defined in the Trust Deed) of the Issuer stating, in relation
to (ii) above, the date of any transfer falling within (ii) above and the identities of the transferor and
transferee shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Trustee and all other
parties.

"Cable and Wireless Group" or the "Group" means the Issuer and its Subsidiaries.

"Subsidiary" means a subsidiary within the meaning of Section 736 of the Companies Act 1985.

"Excluded Subsidiary" means any Subsidiary of the Issuer:

acquisition, development and/or operation of assets or installations;

(ii) none of whose indebtedness for borrowed money in respect of the financing of such

ownership, acquisition, development and/or operation of assets or installations is subject to
any recourse whatsoever to any other member of the Cable and Wireless Group (other than
another Excluded Subsidiary) in respect of the repayment thereof; and

(iii) which has been designated as such by the Issuer by written notice to the Trustee accompanied

by a certificate of two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer that at the time of such designation
such Subsidiary satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above (upon which
certificate the Trustee shall be entitled to rely, and if so relied upon such certificate shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Bondholders and the Couponholders), Provided that the

longer an Excluded Subsidiary, whereupon it shall cease to be an Excluded Subsidiary.

ownership, acquisition, development and/or operation of assets or installations in respect of which the

of the borrower) to secure such indebtedness for borrowed money, Provided that (i) the extent
of such recourse to such borrower is limited solely to the amount of any recoveries made on
any such enforcement, and (ii) such person or persons are not entitled, by virtue of any right or
claim arising out of or in connection with such indebtedness for borrowed money, to

borrower or any of its assets (save for the assets the subject of such encumbrance); and/or

(3) recourse to such borrower generally, or directly or indirectly to a member of the Cable and

Wireless Group, under any form of assurance, undertaking or support, which recourse is
limited to a claim for damages (other than liquidated damages and damages required to be

obligation to procure payment by another or an indemnity in respect thereof or an obligation to
comply or to procure compliance by another with any financial ratios or other tests of financial
condition) by the person against whom such recourse is available.

**9.** **Grant of Security or Redemption to avoid Events of Default**

occurred, an event or act occurs in relation to a Principal Subsidiary which constitutes a
Security Event and also constitutes a Condition 8 Event (a "Default Security Event"); or

occurred, an event or act occurs in relation to a Principal Subsidiary which constitutes a
Condition 8 Event (a "Subsequent Event");

(5) (i) So long as any Bond or Coupon remains outstanding in respect of which Non-cash Collateral

has been granted and has not been withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (6) below the Issuer shall
procure that the aggregate Relevant Value of the Non-cash Collateral shall be determined every
six months after the Collateral Date by an Independent Financial Adviser, the determination of
such Independent Financial Adviser being final and binding; and

(a) if the aggregate Relevant Value of the Non-cash Collateral as shown by such

determination shall be less than 110 per cent. of the aggregate nominal amount of the

(including the Bonds) constituted by the Trust Deed or any supplemental deed or (ii) upon such terms as

##### THE CABLE AND WIRELESS GROUP

**1.** **Formation of the Issuer**

The Issuer was formed in 1929 through the merger of United Kingdom companies that had been among

the pioneers of international telecommunications in the nineteenth century by submarine cable and, in

the twentieth century, by radio or "wireless".

In 1947 HM Government acquired all the shares in the Issuer. Around that time certain Commonwealth
countries acquired their external telecommunication services from the Issuer and the external services
operated by the Issuer from the United Kingdom were transferred to the Post Office.

In 1981 the Issuer obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange when HM Government sold just
under half of its shares. HM Government further reduced its shareholding in 1983 and 1985 and at
present does not own any ordinary shares in the Issuer, although it does retain a special rights
preference share of £1 (the "Special Share") carrying rights summarised in paragraph 4 below.

**2.** **Financial information on the Group**

The financial information included in the tables headed "Business Activities" and "Business Regions"
and the paragraph headed "Five Year Summary of the Group" is extracted from the statutory accounts
for the three or five years ended 31st March, 1995, as indicated, except where restated to comply with

Financial Reporting Standard 3 "Reporting financial performance" ("FRS 3") as noted below, or
otherwise restated as noted in footnotes to the tables. The financial information included in the
paragraph headed "1995 Interim Results of the Group" is extracted from the preliminary announcement
of interim results for the six months ended 30th September, 1995 released on 16th November, 1995.
The statutory accounts, which were audited by KPMG for each of the five years ended 31st March,

1995, and in respect of which the auditors have given unqualified reports, without any statement under

Section 237(2) to (4) of the Companies Act 1985, have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.

FRS 3 was adopted for the year ended 31st March, 1993. The figures for the year ended 31st March,
1992 have been extracted from the comparative figures included in the 1993 financial statements,

where they had been restated in the manner required for comparatives. The Group was not required to
prepare its financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 1991 in accordance with FRS 3 and the
figures for that year have been restated in accordance with its provisions.

The principal changes in presentation are:

(i) items that previously would have been reported as extraordinary have been classified as

exceptional;

(ii) the format of the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account has been amended to show separately

from operating profit, significant profits or losses from the partial sale of subsidiaries; and

(iii) the profit and loss on disposal of all or part of a previously acquired business is calculated after

taking account of the gross amount of any material goodwill previously dealt with as a movement in
Group reserves.

Financial Reporting Standard 5 "Reporting the substance of transactions" ("FRS 5") was adopted for the

year ended 31st March, 1995. Assets and liabilities for each of the four years ended 31st March, 1994

have been extracted from the table included in the 1995 annual report and accounts, where they have
been restated in accordance with FRS 5.

**3.** **The business of the Group**

The Cable and Wireless Group is a leading international provider of telecommunications services. The

Group operates in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the United States and provides services to over 50
other countries, and has interests in telecommunications companies operating in a number of additional
countries, including Japan. The Group's operating revenue derives principally from public
telecommunications including international and domestic telephone services, facsimile and data
transmission, other telecommunications services such as leased circuits and telex services and the sale
and rental of telecommunications equipment manufactured by others.

The Group provides external telecommunications for over 30 countries and internal telecommunications
for over 20 countries. It also provides and manages communications facilities and services for public
and private customers and provides telecommunications consultancy both outside and within the

United Kingdom.

In the United Kingdom, the Issuer's 80 per cent. owned subsidiary, Mercury Communications Limited
("Mercury") operates as a public telecommunications operator under a licence granted by
HM Government in 1984. Mercury has invested over £3.1 billion in creating the only all-digital national
network in Europe. Mercury's optical fibre network links all the major population centres throughout

14


-----

Great Britain and some 2.5 million telephone lines are now directly or indirectly connected to the
Mercury network.

In September 1993, Mercury one2one, a 50 percent./50 percent. joint venture between the Issuer and
US West, was launched, providing digital cellular mobile services, initially within a 30 kilometre radius of

central London. The coverage area now extends to the city centres of Manchester, Southampton,

Bristol, Nottingham, Sheffield, Liverpool and Leeds and the service is currently available to 40 per cent.
of the United Kingdom population. 90 per cent. population coverage is planned by the end of 1997.

The Group has a 58.0 per cent. shareholding in Hongkong Telecommunications Limited ("HKT"), Hong

Kong's major telecommunications undertaking. HKT has exclusive rights to provide Hong Kong's
international public telephone and telex facilities and services and international facsimile and data

transmission facilities. The domestic exclusive franchise expired on 30th June, 1995 and was replaced
by a non-exclusive licence for a term of 15 years from 1st July, 1995, which includes a clause which
provides for renewal for a further 15 years, and the international exclusive franchise expires on 30th
September, 2006. HKT has over 3.1 million telephone lines in operation serving Hong Kong's population
of more than 6.0 million and digitalisation of the network was completed in 1993. HKT has undertaken
extensive video-on-demand trials and intends to launch such services in mid 1996.

In January 1995, the Group announced a European alliance with VEBA AG of Germany. Two joint
venture companies will implement the alliance. Vebacom GmbH, owned 55 per cent. by VEBA and 45
per cent. by the Issuer will be responsible for the development of telecommunications services in
Germany. Cable & Wireless Europe S.A. is owned 50 per cent./50 per cent. and manages and will
develop the partners telecommunications interests in the European Union (excluding Germany and the
United Kingdom) and Switzerland.

The Group is directing its operations into three main strategic regions: Asia, Europe and the Caribbean

(including the Caribbean Rim). The principal operations of the Group and its associated companies in the
Caribbean are in Jamaica, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago.

subsidiary companies and branches but in some territories services are provided by associated
companies, such as in Japan, Australia, Trinidad, Bahrain and Sweden.

The Group provides to its customers worldwide telecommunications services using facilities that
incorporate increasingly advanced technology, such as digital electronics and fibre optic cables. The
Group is expanding its network, including participating in new transatlantic and transpacific digital fibre
optic cables and other transmission facilities, developing alliances with other telecommunications
companies and providing services to new markets. The Group supplies leased circuits to users for their
exclusive use. It also provides large international users such as airlines and banks with international
managed networks offering high-speed, economic and reliable facilities from and to specific origins and
destinations,

Outside the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and Sweden, the
telecommunications services of the Group are generally operated under long-term licences issued by
national governments, under which the Group has the exclusive right to own, install and operate its own
systems and equipment.

comprised 2,209,426,659 Ordinary shares of 25p each and the Special Share.

_Rights and Restrictions attaching to the Special Share_

The Special Share was issued to HM Government on 23rd November, 1983. In summary, the rights and

restrictions attaching to it are as follows:

(a) the Special Share may only be held by one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State or another Minister

of the Crown, by the Solicitor for the Affairs of HM Treasury or by some other person acting on
behalf of the Crown;

(b) each of the following matters is deemed a variation of the rights attaching to the Special Share and

is effective only with the written consent of the holder of the Special Share (i) any amendment or
removal of certain provisions of the Articles of Association, including the limitation on shareholdings
and the requirement that any person holding the office of executive chairman or, if there is no such

16


-----

executive chairman, the office of chief executive or joint chief executive of the Issuer be a British
citizen; (ii) a proposal for the voluntary winding up or dissolution of the Issuer (iii) a disposal of the
whole or a material part of the assets of the Group, and (iv) the creation or issue of any shares
carrying voting rights which are different from the voting rights of the Ordinary shares;

(c) the holder of the Special Share is entitled to receive notice of general meetings of the Issuer, and to

attend and speak, but not vote, at such meetings; and

(d) the Special Share carries no right to participate in profits or assets of the Issuer beyond a right to

repayment of £1 in priority to any payment to other members in the event of a winding up.

The Special Share may be redeemed for £1 at any time by agreement between the Directors of the

Issuer and the holder of the Special Share.

With the consent of the holder of the Special Share, a special resolution was passed at an Extraordinary
General Meeting of the Issuer held on 15th January, 1996 which amended certain provisions of the
Articles of Association. The requirement that any person holding the office of executive chairman or, if
there is no such executive chairman, the office of chief executive or joint chief executive of the Issuer
be a British citizen has been amended to the effect that at least one of the directors holding the offices
of chairman or chief executive of the Issuer be a British citizen.

_Limitations on Shareholdings in the Issuer_

Article 36 of the Issuer's Articles of Association provides that (with certain limited exceptions) no person
may (i) hold more than 15 per cent. of the shares at any time in issue which ordinarily carry the right to

vote on a poll at general meetings, or (ii) exercise (or control the exercise of) more than 15 per cent. of
the votes ordinarily exercisable on a poll at general meetings. For the purpose of each such prohibition,
the interests of any person are aggregated with those of his "Associates" as defined in the Articles of
Association.

The Directors are given various powers under the Articles of Association to enforce these provisions

including the power to refuse to register shares in the name of any person in relation to whom they
believe the limitation may be exceeded, the power to serve notice on any person requiring him to make
a declaration that he is not in breach of the limitations (and to disenfranchise any shares held by him
pending receipt of such declaration), and the power to require the transfer of "excess shares" held by
any person and, if necessary, to effect a sale of such shares.

**7.** **Factors affecting the Group**

The Group, like other telecommunication companies, is subject to governmental and regulatory controls

in the country in which it does business and like other major international groups, it can be affected by
economic and political events and other developments in any part of the world in which it operates. As a
major part of its business is conducted overseas, the Group's results expressed in sterling will continue
to be sensitive to changes in exchange rates.

**8.** **1995 Interim Results of the Group**

The following is the text of the Issuer's preliminary announcement of the Group's interim results

(excluding information for North American Shareholders and posting and enquiries details) for the six

-----

Cable & Wireless Executive Chairman, Lord Young said: "Progress continues to be made on all fronts
with financial performance reflecting our management focus on delivering consistent and superior
earnings growth. I remain confident about the outlook for the year as a whole.

Turnover was ahead by 7 per cent. with a faster rate of growth in earnings per share of 9 per cent.

Including the profit on disposal of our investment in Mannesmann Mobilfunk eps growth was 65 per
cent. We increased the interim dividend by 9 per cent. to 3.08 pence.

Growth in demand for fixed wire services has been slower than in the recent past, reflecting a
slowdown in the rate of economic activity generally in some of our markets combined with increased
levels of competition. However, the overall rate of earnings growth has exceeded that of turnover
growth as we continue to vigorously pursue cost reductions and as our policy of rapidly expanding into
new markets over the past few years begins to bear fruit with a reduction in the start-up losses for a
number of these ventures while others begin to move into profit."

"I have agreed with the Board that I shall stand down from my position as Executive Chairman on my
65th birthday on 27th February, 1997. I am announcing this now in order to end the recent ill-informed
and destabilising comment, and to put the record straight."

**Results**

_Turnover at £2,711 million was 7 per cent. higher than the comparable period of the previous year_

reflecting underlying growth across all business regions.

_Operating profit at £636 million was 7 per cent. higher than the comparable period of the previous year._

The Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates. It is estimated that had the comparable period's
average rates of exchange applied to this year's reported currency results, the operating profit would
have been some £30 million higher than that now reported. This translation difference arises principally
from the movement in the rates of exchange between sterling and the Hong Kong dollar and sterling
and the Jamaican dollar.

_Pre-tax profit increased by 44 per cent. to £815 million. Pre-tax profit includes an exceptional profit of_

£199 million for the sale of the Company's 5.03 per cent. interest in Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH.
Pre-tax profit excluding exceptional item increased by 9 per cent. to £616 million.

_The profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders increased by 66 per cent. to £431 million after an_

estimated tax charge of 23.2 per cent. The profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders before
exceptional item was £286 million after an estimated tax charge of 22.0 per cent. (1994—22.5 per
cent.).

_Earnings per share increased by 65 per cent. to 19.6 pence compared with the same period last year._
Earnings per share, excluding the exceptional item, increased by 9 per cent. to 13 pence compared with

the same period last year.

_Net gearing at 30th September, 1995 was 21.7 per cent. compared with 20.1 per cent. at 31st March,_
1995.

_Cash outflow before financing for the half year was £191 million (1994—£73 million) after purchase of_

tangible fixed assets and investments of £682 million (1994—£648 million).

_Net interest cover was 26 times (1994—35 times)._

**Dividend**

The Directors have declared an interim dividend of 3.08 pence (1994—2.83 pence) per Ordinary Share,
an increase of 9 per cent. The dividend will be paid on 28th February, 1996 to shareholders on the
Register at 12th December, 1995. The cost of the interim dividend is £68 million (1994—£62 million).
Shareholders (other than those with registered addresses in the United States) will again be offered a
scrip dividend as an alternative to cash.

**Regional Performance**
_Hong Kong_

Turnover in Hongkong Telecom (57.5 per cent. owned) improved by 5 per cent. to £1,186 million, and
operating profit by 8 per cent. to £439 million reflecting continuing growth in demand especially for
cellular mobile services, combined with tighter cost control. International outgoing minutes increased by
8 per cent. and customer lines increased by 5 per cent. Call volumes to and from China grew by 8 per
cent. and continue to be depressed by the tightening of economic policies within China to contain
growth and inflation. The number of cellular customers grew by 57 per cent. bringing the total to more
than 200,000.

19


-----

_Other Asia_

The largest business in the region, Macau (51 per cent. owned) showed an increase in turnover of 7 per
cent. with a decrease in operating profit of 2 per cent., reflecting increased international and mobile
phone revenues offset by increased employee costs and depreciation, reflecting the growth of the
network.

_United Kingdom_

The main operating unit within this region is Mercury (80 per cent. owned). Mercury turnover increased
by 5 per cent. to £833 million and operating profit increased by 7 per cent. to £103 million. Mercury
revenues reflect a 12 per cent. increase in switched minutes and customer line growth of 38 per cent.
partially offset by tariff reductions. The increase in operating profit reflects the impact of the
reorganisation of the business announced in November 1994.

_Other Europe_

Turnover has increased by 33 per cent. to £24 million due to the growth of new international services.
Operating losses have increased to £20 million due to increased expenditure on product development,
marketing and network development.

_The Caribbean_

Turnover has increased by 7 per cent. to £266 million and operating profit by 15 per cent. to £90 million,

reflecting the continued strong local growth offset by adverse currency translation effects. International
outgoing minutes increased by 10 per cent. and customer lines increased by 11 per cent.

_North America_

The main operating unit within the region is Cable & Wireless Inc. Cable & Wireless Inc turnover
remained flat at £221 million reflecting adverse currency translation effects. Operating profit increased
by 13 per cent. due to continued cost reductions. Minutes on the network grew by 11 per cent. The
region's results show a decrease in operating profit of £1 million to £19 million due to the inclusion of

the new subsidiary, Vitacom, in the current period.

_Rest of the world_

Turnover has increased by 58 per cent. to £158 million principally due to the acquisition of BT Marine.
Operating profit for the region decreased to £4 million as the increased profits of Marine operations
were offset by the reduced profits of Yemen and Pakistan and increased losses of C&W Business

Networks.

_Corporate Costs_
Corporate costs at £12 million show a reduction of £3 million over the same period last year reflecting
the impact of the restructuring and the rationalisation of the London based Corporate and Regional
headquarters.

_Business Development_
Business development costs have decreased to £7 million, reflecting a slower pace of development
activity.

**Associated Undertakings**
The Group share of the losses less profits of associated undertakings is £3 million (1994—£19 million).
This reflects a general improvement in results: share of losses at Mercury One-2-One £27 million
(1994—£30 million), Optus (Australia) £1 million (1994—£4 million) and Tele2 (Sweden) £1 million
(1994—£3 million).

**Net Interest and Other Similar Income**
Net interest and other similar income shows a net charge of £17 million compared with a net charge of
£6 million last year.

**Exceptional Item**
The exceptional item of £199 million relates to the profit on sale of the Company's 5.03 per cent.

interest in Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH. The tax charge attributable to the disposal is £54 million.

**Post Balance Sheet Event**
On 5th October, 1995, the agreement with VEBA to establish the VEBACOM joint venture (45 per cent.
owned by Cable & Wireless, 55 per cent. by VEBA) was completed. The gross consideration payable by
Cable & Wireless amounts to DM 1,860 million; DM 1,100 million payable on completion with the
balance due over three years.

The Group's interest in the joint venture on completion after taking into account differences between

UK and German accounting, amounted to approximately DM 630 million, which will give rise to goodwill
in the annual Group accounts of approximately DM 1,230 million (£550 million).

**Review Report by KPMG to Cable and Wireless plc**
We have reviewed the interim financial information for the six months ended 30th September, 1995 set
out on pages 6 to 13*, which is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. Our
responsibility is to report on the results of our review.

Our review was carried out having regard to the Bulletin "Review of Interim Financial Information",
issued by the Auditing Practices Board, This review consisted principally of applying analytical
procedures to the underlying financial data, assessing whether accounting policies have been
consistently applied, and making enquiries of Group management responsible for financial and
accounting matters. The review was substantially less in scope than an audit performed in accordance
with Auditing Standards and accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the interim financial
information.

On the basis of our review:

               - In our opinion the interim financial information has been prepared using accounting policies

consistent with those adopted by Cable and Wireless plc in its financial statements for the year
ended 31st March, 1995; and

               - We are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the interim financial
information as presented.

##### TAXATION

**The following is a summary of the Issuer's understanding of current and prospective United**

**Kingdom law and practice relating to the taxation of the Bonds. Some aspects do not apply to**

**certain classes of taxpayer (such as dealers). Prospective Bondholders who are in any doubt as**
**to their tax position or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United**

**Kingdom should seek their own professional advice.**

1. The Bonds will constitute "quoted Eurobonds" within the meaning of Section 124 of the Income

and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (the "Act") as long as they continue to be quoted on a "recognised
stock exchange" within the meaning of Section 841 of the Act. The London Stock Exchange is currently
so designated. Accordingly, payments of interest on the Bonds should be made without withholding on
account of tax:

(a) where the Bonds and relative Coupons are held in a "recognised clearing system" within the

meaning of section 124 of the Act (Euroclear, Cedel Bank, societe anonyme and First
Chicago Clearing System are currently so designated); or

(b) where payment is made through an overseas Paying Agent; or

(c) where payment is made by or through a person in the United Kingdom and it is proved to the

Inland Revenue that the beneficial owner of the Bonds and relative Coupons (or the person

whose income the interest is for United Kingdom tax purposes deemed to be) is not resident

in the United Kingdom.

In all other cases an amount must be withheld on account of income tax at the basic rate (currently 25
per cent.), subject to any direction to the contrary by the Inland Revenue pursuant to the provisions of an
applicable double taxation convention. The current draft of the Finance Bill contains provisions which, if
enacted, would reduce the rate of withholding tax to the lower rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent.)
in relation to payments made on or after 6th April, 1996.

Where a United Kingdom collecting agent receives or obtains payment of interest on behalf of a

Bondholder, the collecting agent will be required to withhold on account of income tax at the basic rate
(or at the lower rate (currently 20 per cent.) if the provisions of the Finance Bill referred to above are
enacted):

(a) if the relative Bonds are held in a "recognised clearing system"; or

(b) if payment of the interest was not made by or entrusted to a United Kingdom Paying Agent.

No such withholding will be required, however, if it is proved to the Inland Revenue that the beneficial

owner of the Bonds and relative Coupons is not resident in the United Kingdom and that the interest is

not deemed for United Kingdom tax purposes to be the income of any other person.

The current draft of the Finance Bill contains provisions which, if enacted, would make changes to the
legislation relating to paying and collecting agents with effect from Royal Assent to the Finance Act
1996. The effect of these changes, if enacted, will be, inter alia, to reduce the circumstances in which a
United Kingdom collecting agent obtaining payment of interest on behalf of a Bondholder will be
required to withhold tax.

2. Interest on the Bonds received without deduction or withholding on account of United Kingdom tax

will not be chargeable to United Kingdom tax in the hands of a Bondholder who is not resident for tax
purposes in the United Kingdom, unless the Bondholder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the
United Kingdom through a United Kingdom branch or agency in connection with which the interest is
received or to which the Bonds are attributable. There are certain exemptions for interest received by
certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers).

If the Bondholder is chargeable to tax under the above rules, exemption from or reduction in the tax

payable on the interest might be available in appropriate circumstances under the provisions of an
applicable double taxation convention.

3. If the current Finance Bill is enacted in its present form, existing rules will apply to individuals and

corporates until 1 st April, 1996. Accordingly:

(a) the provisions of the accrued income scheme may apply to persons transferring Bonds

which bear interest or to persons to whom such Bonds are transferred. Generally, persons
who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and dealers in
securities will not be subject to the provisions of the scheme. On a transfer of securities

with accrued interest the scheme usually applies to deem the transferor to receive an
amount of income equal to the accrued interest and to deem the transferee to obtain an
equivalent credit to set against the deemed or actual interest he subsequently receives; and

28


-----

(b) the Bonds will constitute "qualifying corporate bonds" within the meaning of Section 117 of

the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Accordingly, a disposal by a Bondholder will not
give rise to a chargeable gain or an allowable loss for the purposes of the taxation of capital
gains.

From 1st April, 1996 the position of individual Bondholders will be unchanged. The Bonds will not be
discounted securities for the purposes of the new rules relating to securities held by non-corporate
bondholders. In contrast most Bondholders subject to United Kingdom corporation tax will bring all
returns and profits, whether of an income or capital nature, on the Bonds into charge as income for UK
corporation tax purposes on an accruals or mark-to-market basis. Accordingly, the accrued income
scheme will cease to apply to such Bondholders in respect of transfers of bonds on or after 1st April,

1996.

4. No stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable on a transfer of the Bonds by delivery.

Capital Markets Limited (as agent for National Westminster Bank Plc), Cazenove & Co. and Goldman
Sachs International (the "Managers") have jointly and severally agreed to subscribe for the Bonds at the

(the "Securities Act") and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons except in certain transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the

or deliver the Bonds, (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for
the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Bonds during
the restricted period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sale of the
Bonds within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Bonds within the
United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.

Each Manager has represented and agreed that (a) it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell any
Bonds to persons in the United Kingdom prior to admission of the Bonds to listing in accordance with
Part IV of the Financial Services Act 1986 (the "FSA") except to persons whose ordinary activities
involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the
purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result
in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities
Regulations 1995 or the FSA; (b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSA

with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Bonds in, from or otherwise involving the United

Kingdom; and (c) it has only issued or passed on and will only issue or pass on in the United Kingdom
any document received by it in connection with the issue of Bonds, other than any document which
consists of or any part of listing particulars, supplementary listing particulars or any other document

required or permitted to be published by listing rules under Part IV of the FSA, to a person who is of a
kind described in Article 11(3) of the Financial Services Act 1986 (Investment Advertisements)
(Exemptions) Order 1995 or is a person to whom such document may otherwise lawfully be issued or
passed on.

Each Manager has represented and agreed that:

(a) it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell in Hong Kong, by means of any document,
any Bonds other than to persons whose ordinary business it is to buy or sell shares or
debentures (whether as principal or agent) or in circumstances which do not constitute an
offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32) of Hong Kong;
and

(b) unless it is a person permitted to do so under the securities laws of Hong Kong, it has not

issued or had in its possession for the purposes of issue and will not issue or have in its
possession for the purposes of issue any advertisement, invitation or document relating to
the Bonds other than with respect to Bonds intended to be disposed of to persons outside
Hong Kong, or to be disposed of in Hong Kong only to persons whose business involves the
acquisition, disposal or holding of securities, whether as principal or agent.
